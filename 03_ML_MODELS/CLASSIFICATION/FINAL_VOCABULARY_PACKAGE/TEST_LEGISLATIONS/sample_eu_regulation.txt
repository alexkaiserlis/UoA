(4) Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) constitute the backbone of the European economy and should benefit from improved market access opportunities provided by trade agreements. The Union should take measures to facilitate SME participation in international trade.

(5) The protection of intellectual property rights is crucial for fostering innovation and competitiveness. Trade agreements should include strong and enforceable provisions on intellectual property protection.
