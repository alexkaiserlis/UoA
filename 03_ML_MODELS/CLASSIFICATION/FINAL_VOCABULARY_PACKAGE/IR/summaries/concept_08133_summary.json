  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the concept of \"trade good\" is redirected to the preferred term \"goods.\" This encompasses all tangible products that are exchanged in commerce, subject to various regulatory measures aimed at ensuring fair trade practices, consumer protection, and market integrity. The classification of goods is critical for the application of EU legislation, including customs regulations and trade agreements. Understanding the nuances of goods is essential for compliance with EU standards and for facilitating the smooth operation of the internal market, thereby promoting economic cohesion among member states.",
