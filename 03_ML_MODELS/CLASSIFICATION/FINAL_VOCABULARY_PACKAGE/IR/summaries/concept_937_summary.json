  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"farm\" is redirected to \"agricultural holding,\" which serves as a comprehensive descriptor for entities engaged in agricultural production. This concept delimits various farming systems, including those that cultivate combinable crops and house livestock in abattoirs. Agricultural holdings are identified through microdata, stratifying them into categories based on their outputs and practices. Regularized frameworks, such as the FADN (Farm Accountancy Data Network), provide annualised insights into their economic viability. Furthermore, the significance of these holdings is underscored by their role in winegrowers' associations and their contributions to bioliquids. Understanding these linkages enhances comprehensibility in agricultural policy formulation and implementation across the EU.",
