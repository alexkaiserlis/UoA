  "summary": "The term \"extermination camp\" is a redirect to \"concentration camp,\" reflecting the historical context of systematic human rights violations. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, concentration camps are associated with severe breaches of international law, particularly concerning human dignity and the prohibition of torture and inhumane treatment. The EU's commitment to upholding human rights necessitates a clear condemnation of such facilities, which have been used for mass extermination and persecution. This concept underscores the importance of vigilance against crimes against humanity and the need for robust legal mechanisms to prevent the recurrence of such atrocities within the EU and beyond.",
