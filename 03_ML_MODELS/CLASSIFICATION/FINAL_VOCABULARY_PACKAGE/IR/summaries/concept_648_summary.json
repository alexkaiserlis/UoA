  "summary": "Transport economics, as a concept within EU transport policy, scrutinizes the rationalizing of resources and inputs in the transport sector. It provides a theoretical framework for understanding the implications of various transport modes on consumption patterns and economic efficiency. By analyzing the tonnage of goods transported and the fuel efficiency of engines, policymakers can affirm the need for sustainable practices. This includes investing in technologies that save fuel and reduce emissions, thereby remedying the deteriorating environmental impacts. The EUâ€™s regulatory endeavours aim to create a definite framework that addresses incompatibility issues while fostering a keen awareness of the economic angles involved in transport decisions.",
