  "summary": "The concept of \"Mediterranean agriculture\" pertains to the agricultural policy framework within the European Union, specifically addressing the unique challenges and opportunities faced by Mediterranean regions. This includes the promotion of sustainable agricultural practices, the preservation of biodiversity, and the enhancement of rural development. EU legal and regulatory documents emphasize the importance of adapting agricultural strategies to local climatic conditions and socio-economic contexts. Mediterranean agriculture is crucial for ensuring food security, fostering economic resilience, and supporting environmental sustainability in these regions. The EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) plays a pivotal role in facilitating these objectives through targeted funding and regulatory measures.",
