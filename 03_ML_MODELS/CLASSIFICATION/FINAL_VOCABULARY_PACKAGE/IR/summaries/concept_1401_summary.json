  "summary": "The \"electrotechnical industry,\" redirected to \"electrical engineering,\" encompasses a broad spectrum of activities related to electronics and electrical engineering within the EU regulatory framework. This sector includes the design and manufacture of switchgear and appliances, which must comply with stringent regulations concerning substances like hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). Technicians in this field must be aware of potential hazards, such as overspeed conditions in machinery, and ensure that materials like hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) and phthalates are securely managed. The nomenclature for electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) is critical for recyclers and manufacturers, particularly in regions like Sichuan and Xiamen, where companies like Haier and TCL operate. Compliance with regulations on substances of very high concern (SVHC) and the proper management of diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) are essential for sustainable practices in this industry.",
