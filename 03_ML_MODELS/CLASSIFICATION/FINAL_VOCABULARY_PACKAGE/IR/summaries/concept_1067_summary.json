These forests are crucial for environmental sustainability, contributing to carbon sequestration, habitat preservation, and the overall health of terrestrial ecosystems. The EU recognizes the importance of natural forests in its forestry policies, promoting their conservation and sustainable management through directives and regulations aimed at protecting biodiversity and combating climate change. By prioritizing the preservation of natural forests, the EU seeks to enhance ecological resilience and ensure the sustainable use of forest resources for future generations.",
