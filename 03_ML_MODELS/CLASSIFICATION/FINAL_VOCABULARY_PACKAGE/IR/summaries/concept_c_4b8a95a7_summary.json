  "summary": "Business continuity planning, often redirected to the preferred term \"business continuity,\" is a critical framework within EU legal and regulatory contexts aimed at ensuring that organizations can maintain essential functions during and after disruptive events. This concept encompasses risk assessment, resource allocation, and strategic management to mitigate potential impacts on operations. In the EU, regulatory frameworks necessitate that businesses develop robust continuity plans to comply with directives related to data protection, financial stability, and public safety. Effective business continuity planning not only safeguards organizational resilience but also aligns with broader EU objectives of enhancing overall economic stability and security.",
