  "summary": "The concept of \"political practice,\" categorized under politics and public safety, is redirected to the preferred term \"political behaviour.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, political behaviour encompasses the actions, attitudes, and interactions of individuals and groups within political systems. It is crucial for understanding the dynamics of governance, public policy formulation, and electoral processes. The analysis of political behaviour aids in assessing compliance with EU regulations and the effectiveness of democratic institutions. By studying these practices, policymakers can enhance transparency, accountability, and public engagement in the political sphere, ultimately fostering a more robust democratic environment within the EU.",
