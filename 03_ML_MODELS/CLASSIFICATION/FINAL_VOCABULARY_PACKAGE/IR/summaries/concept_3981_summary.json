  "summary": "The \"majority voting system\" is a fundamental electoral procedure utilized within the European Union's decision-making framework. This system mandates that decisions are made based on the majority of votes cast, ensuring that the preferences of the majority are reflected in legislative outcomes. It is particularly relevant in the context of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, where it facilitates efficient governance and democratic representation. By employing a majority voting system, the EU aims to streamline its regulatory processes, enhance accountability, and promote collective decision-making among member states, thereby reinforcing the principles of democratic legitimacy and unity within the Union.",
