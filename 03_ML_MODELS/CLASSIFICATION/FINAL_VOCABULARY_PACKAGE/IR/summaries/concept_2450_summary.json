  "summary": "The \"common commercial policy\" (CCP) is a fundamental aspect of EU trade law, which investigates and adjudicates trade relations with external partners. It encompasses the establishment of countermeasures against disruptive practices and aims to streamline trade regulations. The CCP is inspired by the need for cohesive lawmaking that fulfills the EU's objectives, including the promotion of friendship among nations. It addresses extraterritorial issues and facilitates plurilateral agreements, such as those stemming from the Nairobi and Uruguayan rounds. By specifying conditions for waivers and grandfathering provisions, the CCP ensures that regulations do not hinder trade, thus fostering a conducive environment for organizations engaged in international commerce, including those dealing with whisky and other goods.",
