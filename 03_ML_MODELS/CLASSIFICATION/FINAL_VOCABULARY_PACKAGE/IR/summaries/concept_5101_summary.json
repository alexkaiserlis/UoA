  "summary": "The \"Panama Canal Zone,\" now redirected to the preferred term \"Panama Canal,\" is a significant maritime corridor impacting global trade and transport regulations. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the Panama Canal serves as a vital link for maritime and inland waterway transport, facilitating the movement of goods between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Its strategic importance necessitates compliance with international maritime laws and EU regulations governing shipping routes, environmental standards, and safety protocols. The canal's operational policies may influence EU maritime transport directives, thereby affecting trade agreements and economic relations with member states and third countries.",
