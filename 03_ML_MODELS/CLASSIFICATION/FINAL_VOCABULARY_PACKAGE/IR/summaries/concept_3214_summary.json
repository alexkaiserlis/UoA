  "summary": "The concept of \"independent trade,\" redirected to \"independent retailer,\" pertains to the category of distributive trades within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Independent retailers operate autonomously, distinct from larger corporate chains, and play a crucial role in promoting competition and consumer choice in the market. The EU recognizes the significance of independent retailers in fostering economic diversity and supporting local economies. Regulatory measures often aim to enhance the operational environment for these entities, ensuring fair trading practices and preventing monopolistic behaviors. This concept underscores the importance of maintaining a balanced retail landscape within the EU's internal market.",
