  "summary": "Export credit insurance is a crucial financial instrument within the EU regulatory framework, designed to support exporters by providing guarantees against the risks of non-payment by foreign buyers. This insurance encourages the flow of exports, allowing businesses to undertake international contracts with greater confidence. Insurers play a powerful role in this system, as they assess the creditworthiness of foreign markets and provide coverage that can smooth the complexities of international trade. The cooperative efforts of various departments and organizations enhance competitiveness and facilitate the interdependence of economies. As a decisive factor in mitigating risks, export credit insurance contributes to the growth of commercial undertakings, addressing difficulties that may arise in subcontracting and finance.",
