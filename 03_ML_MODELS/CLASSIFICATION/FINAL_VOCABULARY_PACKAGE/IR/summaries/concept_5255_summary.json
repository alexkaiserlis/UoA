  "summary": "The concept of \"volume of catch,\" redirected to \"catch of fish,\" is pivotal in EU fisheries regulation, addressing the sustainable management of marine resources. This term encompasses the total quantity of fish, such as haddock and prawn, harvested during a voyage. Regulatory frameworks impose conditionalities to minimize overfishing and ensure that catches are traceable and logbook entries are accurate. The EU aims to replenish ecosystems by protecting nurseries and mature stocks, such as soles and crangon, while preventing unlicensed activities. By affixing barcodes to catches, the EU enhances traceability, crucial for combating IUU (Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated) fishing practices.",
