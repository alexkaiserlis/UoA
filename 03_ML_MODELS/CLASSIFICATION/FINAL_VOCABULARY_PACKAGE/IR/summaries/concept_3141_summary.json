This regulatory framework encompasses the systematic observation of seismic events, which is essential for understanding geological hazards and informing disaster preparedness strategies. The EU emphasizes the integration of seismic monitoring into broader environmental assessments, ensuring compliance with directives aimed at environmental protection and sustainable development. By facilitating data collection and analysis, seismic monitoring supports informed decision-making and enhances the resilience of communities against potential seismic threats.",
