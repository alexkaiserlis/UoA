  "summary": "Mass tourism refers to the phenomenon of large numbers of tourists visiting a particular destination, often leading to significant social and environmental impacts. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, mass tourism is addressed through various directives aimed at sustainable development, environmental protection, and the promotion of cultural heritage. The EU recognizes the need to balance economic benefits derived from tourism with the preservation of local communities and ecosystems. Regulatory measures may include zoning laws, visitor management strategies, and incentives for sustainable practices to mitigate the adverse effects of mass tourism on social affairs and local infrastructures.",
