  "summary": "The \"right to strike\" is a fundamental aspect of labour law and labour relations within the European Union, recognized as a crucial mechanism for workers to assert their interests and negotiate better conditions. This right is often enshrined in national legislation and is influenced by EU directives promoting social dialogue and workers' rights. The EU legal framework supports the right to strike as a form of collective action, balancing it against the need for economic stability and public order. While the right is protected, its exercise may be subject to certain limitations, ensuring that it aligns with broader regulatory objectives and respects the rights of all stakeholders involved.",
