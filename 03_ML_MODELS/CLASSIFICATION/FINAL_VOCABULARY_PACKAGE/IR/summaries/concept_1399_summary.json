  "summary": "Maternity benefit is a crucial component of social protection within the European Union, designed to support women during pregnancy and after childbirth. It encompasses financial assistance provided to eligible mothers, ensuring they can maintain a minimum standard of living while taking maternity leave. The regulatory framework governing maternity benefits varies across EU member states, reflecting differing national policies and practices. However, EU directives aim to harmonize these benefits, promoting gender equality and safeguarding the rights of working mothers. By facilitating access to maternity benefits, the EU reinforces its commitment to social justice and the well-being of families across its member states.",
