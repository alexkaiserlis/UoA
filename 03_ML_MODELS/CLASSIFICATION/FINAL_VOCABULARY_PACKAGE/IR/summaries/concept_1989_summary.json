  "summary": "The concept of \"moral science,\" redirected to \"ethics,\" plays a crucial role in EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Ethics encompasses multidisciplinary approaches to address sensitive issues, particularly in fields like biotechnology and technology. The EU often appoints expert advisers to consult on ethical implications, ensuring that regulations reflect societal values. With a mandate to respond to evolving challenges, the EU's ethical framework incorporates skills and competences necessary for effective governance. This includes creating timely expressions of ethical standards and launching initiatives that renew public trust. As the landscape evolves, ethics remains a pivotal element in shaping policies and closing gaps in regulatory frameworks.",
