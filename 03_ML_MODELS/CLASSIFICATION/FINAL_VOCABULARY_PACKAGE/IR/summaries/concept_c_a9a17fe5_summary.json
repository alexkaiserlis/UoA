  "summary": "Labour market theory, often referred to as labour economics, is a critical framework within EU legal and regulatory contexts that examines the dynamics of employment, wages, and the allocation of resources in the labour market. This theory informs various EU policies aimed at enhancing employment opportunities, addressing unemployment, and ensuring fair labour practices across member states. By analyzing factors such as supply and demand for labour, productivity, and wage determination, labour economics provides essential insights that guide legislative measures and regulatory frameworks. As a redirect to \"labour economics,\" this concept underscores the importance of economic principles in shaping effective labour market policies within the EU.",
