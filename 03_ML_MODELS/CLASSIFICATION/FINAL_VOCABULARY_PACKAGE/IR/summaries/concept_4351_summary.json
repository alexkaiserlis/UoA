  "summary": "The \"Kingdom of Eswatini,\" a landlocked nation in Southern Africa, is often referenced in EU legal and regulatory documents as \"Eswatini.\" This redirect emphasizes its preferred term, facilitating clarity in discussions regarding regional trade agreements, such as the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) with the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Eswatini's economic geography is characterized by diverse agricultural outputs, including pineapples and peaches, and its unique position northwards of Mpumalanga influences trade dynamics. The countryâ€™s regulatory frameworks aim to positively impact its economic landscape, utilising resources like cloven-hoofed ungulates for sustainable hunting practices, while also addressing challenges like land use and environmental conservation.",
