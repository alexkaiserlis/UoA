  "summary": "Political kidnapping refers to the unlawful abduction of individuals for political motives, often to exert pressure on governments or influence political outcomes. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such acts are considered serious violations of human rights and public safety. The European Union, through various treaties and regulations, condemns political kidnapping and promotes cooperative measures among member states to combat this phenomenon. The EU's commitment to upholding democratic values necessitates robust legal responses to prevent and address political kidnappings, ensuring accountability and protection for victims. Such actions undermine the rule of law and democratic integrity across the region.",
