  "summary": "Public procurement within the EU legal framework refers to the processes by which public authorities acquire goods, services, and works. Governed by a series of directives and regulations, public procurement aims to ensure transparency, competition, and equal treatment of suppliers across member states. The regulatory landscape includes the Public Procurement Directive, which establishes common rules and procedures to facilitate cross-border trade and prevent discrimination. This concept is pivotal in promoting efficient use of public funds while fostering innovation and sustainability. Compliance with these regulations is essential for public entities to uphold the principles of the internal market and enhance accountability.",
