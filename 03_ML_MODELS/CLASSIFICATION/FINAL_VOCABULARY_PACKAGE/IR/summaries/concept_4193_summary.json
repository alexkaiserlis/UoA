  "summary": "A \"firm governed by commercial law\" refers to a legal entity operating under the principles of commercial legislation within the EU framework. Such firms, often structured as corporations or partnerships, engage in activities that may include the production and distribution of goods, such as petrochemicals or brennstoffhandel. They are subject to competition laws, which aim to prevent monopolistic practices and ensure fair competition. Notably, firms may divest certain shareholdings to strengthen their market position or merge with others to enhance their regional influence. The interplay of these entities, including those in sectors like termoelecttrica and handel, shapes the economic landscape, with firms like Ruhrkohle and Bayerische exerting significant influence in their respective markets.",
