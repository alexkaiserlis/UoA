  "summary": "In the context of EU international law, the term \"strait\" refers to a narrow body of water that connects two larger bodies of water, often serving as a significant maritime passage. The legal status of straits is critical under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which outlines navigational rights and responsibilities. Straits may be classified as either international straits, allowing for transit passage, or territorial waters, subject to the coastal state's jurisdiction. The EU's regulatory framework may address issues related to maritime security, environmental protection, and the rights of passage through straits, reflecting their strategic importance in international trade and diplomacy.",
