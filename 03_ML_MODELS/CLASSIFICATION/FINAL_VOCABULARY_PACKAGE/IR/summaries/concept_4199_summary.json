  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"partnership\" refers to a specific legal form of organisation where two or more individuals or entities collaborate to achieve common objectives. Partnerships are characterized by shared responsibilities, profits, and liabilities, governed by partnership agreements that outline the terms of cooperation. This legal structure is essential for various sectors, enabling flexibility and collective decision-making. Within the EU, partnerships may be subject to specific regulations, including those related to taxation, liability, and compliance with EU directives. Understanding the nuances of partnerships is crucial for effective governance and legal compliance in transnational contexts.",
