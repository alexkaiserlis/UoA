  "summary": "The concept of \"liberal profession\" within the EU legal framework pertains to occupations that require specialized knowledge and are characterized by a degree of autonomy. These professions, which include lawyers, architects, and accountants, are subject to specific authorizations and regulations that ensure compliance with standards of transparency and accountability. The taxation of liberal professions often involves VAT exemptions and precise calculations of turnover, with member states like Greece implementing unique rules. The historical context of these professions has remained stable, yet ongoing harmonization efforts aim to simplify the regulatory burden. Inspections and contributions to social security are also integral to their operational framework, ensuring a definitive response to evolving market needs.",
