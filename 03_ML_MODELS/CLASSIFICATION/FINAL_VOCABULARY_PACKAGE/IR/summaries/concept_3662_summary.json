  "summary": "A \"registered trade mark\" is a legal designation within the EU that provides exclusive rights to the owner over a specific sign, symbol, or logo used to distinguish goods or services. This concept is crucial in the realm of intellectual property, as it ensures that registered trade marks are protected against unauthorized use, thereby safeguarding the brand identity and commercial interests of the trademark holder. The registration process involves thorough examination and compliance with EU regulations, allowing for enforcement actions against infringement. As a redirect, \"registered trademark\" leads to the preferred term, highlighting its significance in EU legal frameworks governing intellectual property rights.",
