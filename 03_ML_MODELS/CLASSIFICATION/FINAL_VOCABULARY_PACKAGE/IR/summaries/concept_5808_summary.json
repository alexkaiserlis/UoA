  "summary": "The term \"scientific press\" refers to the specialized sector of media that disseminates research findings and scholarly articles, primarily within the European Union's regulatory framework. This concept plays a crucial role in promoting transparency and accessibility of scientific knowledge, which is essential for informed policymaking and public discourse. The scientific press serves as a conduit for communication between researchers, policymakers, and the public, thereby fostering a culture of evidence-based decision-making. In the context of EU legal documents, the scientific press is instrumental in ensuring that regulatory developments are informed by the latest scientific insights, enhancing the legitimacy and efficacy of EU legislation.",
