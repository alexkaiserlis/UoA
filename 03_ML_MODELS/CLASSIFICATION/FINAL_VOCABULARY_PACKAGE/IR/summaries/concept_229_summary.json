  "summary": "A \"consumer cooperative\" is a legal entity within the EU framework, classified under distributive trades. It is formed by individuals who unite to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise. Consumer cooperatives operate on principles of mutual benefit and solidarity, allowing members to purchase goods and services at competitive prices. They are governed by specific regulations that ensure transparency and fair practices, aligning with EU consumer protection laws. Such cooperatives play a crucial role in promoting sustainable consumption and enhancing consumer rights within the internal market, fostering a more equitable economic environment.",
