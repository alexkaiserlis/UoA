  "summary": "The concept of \"mixed tenure\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to a farming system that integrates various forms of land ownership and tenancy arrangements. This approach is significant in promoting sustainable agricultural practices, enhancing land use efficiency, and ensuring equitable access to resources. Mixed tenure systems can facilitate collaboration among farmers, improve resilience against market fluctuations, and support rural development initiatives. The EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) recognizes the importance of such systems in achieving environmental objectives and fostering socio-economic stability in rural areas, thereby contributing to the overall sustainability of the agricultural sector.",
