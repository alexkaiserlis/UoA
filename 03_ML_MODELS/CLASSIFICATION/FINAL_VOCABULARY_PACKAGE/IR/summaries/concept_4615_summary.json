  "summary": "The Asian-Pacific Parliamentarians' Union (APPU) is an extra-European organisation that fosters collaboration among parliamentarians from the Asia-Pacific region. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the APPU serves as a platform for dialogue and cooperation on issues pertinent to governance, democracy, and regional stability. While the EU engages with various international bodies, the APPU's role is significant in promoting legislative exchange and enhancing mutual understanding among member states. This interaction can influence EU external relations and contribute to the formulation of policies that align with broader geopolitical interests in the Asia-Pacific area.",
