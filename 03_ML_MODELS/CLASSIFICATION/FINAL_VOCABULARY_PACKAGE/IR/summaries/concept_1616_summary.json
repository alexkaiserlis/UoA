  "summary": "The \"liberalisation of trade\" refers to the process of reducing barriers to trade, facilitating the exchange of goods and services across borders. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, it encompasses agreements with interregional partners, such as Mercosur and Andean countries, aimed at liberalizing agricultural and industrial sectors. This process is considered essential for enhancing competitiveness, as it allows for the reinstating of trade flows and embracing multiparty negotiations. The EU's approach often includes provisions for cabotage and the protection of invertebrates along coastlines, while also addressing issues related to specific crops like triticum and zea mays. Ultimately, liberalising trade culminates in a more integrated community, fostering economic growth and stability.",
