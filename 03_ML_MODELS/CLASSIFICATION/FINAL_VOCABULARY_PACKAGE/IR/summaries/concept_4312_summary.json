  "summary": "The \"transfer of farms\" refers to the legal and regulatory processes involved in the conveyance of agricultural properties within the EU. This concept encompasses various mechanisms, including sales, leases, and inheritances, which facilitate the transition of farm ownership. The EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) plays a pivotal role in regulating these transfers, ensuring that they align with sustainable agricultural practices and contribute to rural development. Additionally, the transfer of farms is subject to compliance with national laws and EU regulations aimed at preserving agricultural structures and promoting efficient production. This ensures that the agricultural sector remains viable and competitive within the EU market.",
