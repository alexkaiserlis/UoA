  "summary": "Foreign investment refers to the allocation of capital by individuals or institutions from one country into assets or enterprises in another, impacting various domains of the economy. In the EU context, regulatory frameworks, such as the NACE classification, aggregate data on foreign investment flows, ensuring systematic reporting and accuracy. Institutions like Eurostat and the ECB regularly compile statistics that reflect the periodicity of these investments, providing a breakdown by geographical regions, including member states like Slovakia, Malta, and Bulgaria. These reports facilitate the adaptation of policies, allowing for the introduction of measures that enhance investment activity while ensuring consistency in financial reporting and calculations across the EU.",
