  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"disaster area,\" a preferred term for \"disaster region,\" refers to zones stricken by severe environmental deterioration, such as earthquakes or droughts. These areas, including regions like Kocaeli and Sakarya, necessitate macrofinancial measures for rehabilitation and infrastructural repairing. The EU mobilises resources to support affected communes, ensuring that stockfarmers and local contractors receive assistance. Following disasters, such as the Friuli earthquake, the EU invites member states to arrange aid, guaranteeing that recovery efforts are effective and sustainable. The ongoing challenges, including aftershocks and subsurface damage, require coordinated responses to restore the surroundings and support affected populations.",
