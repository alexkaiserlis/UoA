  "summary": "The concept of \"dust\" falls under the category of \"deterioration of the environment\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Dust, as a particulate matter, poses significant risks to air quality and public health, necessitating regulatory measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The EU has established directives aimed at monitoring and controlling airborne dust emissions, particularly from industrial activities and urban environments. These regulations are crucial for maintaining environmental integrity and ensuring compliance with air quality standards. Addressing dust pollution is essential for safeguarding ecosystems and promoting sustainable development across member states, aligning with the EU's broader environmental protection objectives.",
