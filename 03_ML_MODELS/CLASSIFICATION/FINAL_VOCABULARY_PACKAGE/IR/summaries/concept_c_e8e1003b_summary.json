  "summary": "The term \"offshore wind turbine\" is redirected to \"offshore wind energy production,\" which encompasses the generation of electricity from wind turbines located in marine environments. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, offshore wind energy production is pivotal for achieving renewable energy targets and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The EU promotes this sector through directives and funding initiatives aimed at enhancing energy security and sustainability. Regulatory measures ensure compliance with environmental standards and facilitate the integration of offshore wind energy into the broader energy market, thereby supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.",
