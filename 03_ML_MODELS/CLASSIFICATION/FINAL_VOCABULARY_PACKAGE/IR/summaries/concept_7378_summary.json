  "summary": "A \"regionalist party\" is a political party that primarily advocates for the interests and rights of a specific region within a state, often seeking greater autonomy or self-governance. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, regionalist parties play a significant role in representing regional identities and aspirations within the broader European political landscape. These parties can influence regional policy-making and contribute to the discourse on subsidiarity, which emphasizes the importance of local governance. Their participation in the European Parliament and other EU institutions underscores the diversity of political representation and the need for regional voices in shaping EU legislation and policies.",
