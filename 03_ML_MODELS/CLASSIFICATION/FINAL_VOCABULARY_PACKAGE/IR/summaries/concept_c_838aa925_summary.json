  "summary": "Nature-based solutions (NbS) refer to strategies that utilize natural processes and ecosystems to address societal challenges, particularly in the context of environmental policy within the EU. These solutions aim to enhance biodiversity, mitigate climate change, and improve water management by integrating ecological principles into urban and rural planning. The EU promotes NbS through various regulatory frameworks, emphasizing their role in achieving sustainability and resilience. By leveraging natural systems, such as wetlands and forests, NbS contribute to the EU's broader environmental objectives, aligning with the European Green Deal and the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, thereby fostering a holistic approach to environmental governance.",
