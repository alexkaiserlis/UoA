  "summary": "Transaction regulations, as a subset of financial legislation, are crucial for ensuring the free movement of capital within the EU. These regulations facilitate disintermediation and promote the use of SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) standards, such as SCT (SEPA Credit Transfer) and SDD (SEPA Direct Debit), which streamline cross-border transactions. They also address the prudentially managed aspects of financial markets, including the use of IBANs (International Bank Account Numbers) and the role of QCCPs (Qualifying Central Counterparties). By formalising the legal framework, these regulations support corporates and industrials in capturing market opportunities while mitigating risks associated with delocation and financial proxies. The adoption of these standards is essential for enhancing the efficiency of payment systems and ensuring compliance with evolving EU directives.",
