  "summary": "Joinery, a key concept within the wood industry category, encompasses various carpentry techniques used to create wooden structures and decorative elements. In EU legal and regulatory contexts, joinery includes the production of items such as figurines, ornaments, and toys, which may feature motifs like floral designs or stylized shapes. Regulations often address the use of materials like plywood, laminboard, and blockboard, ensuring safety standards for products, including those with intricate details like lipping and edges. Joinery also involves the application of techniques for creating miniature items, such as dolls and decorative knick-knacks, which must meet specific quality and safety requirements for indoor use.",
