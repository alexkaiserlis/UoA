  "summary": "The concept of \"ecosystem service\" refers to the myriad benefits that natural ecosystems provide to humanity, which are essential for sustaining life and promoting well-being. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, ecosystem services are integral to environmental policies aimed at biodiversity conservation, sustainable development, and climate resilience. The EU recognizes the importance of these services in its legislative instruments, such as the EU Biodiversity Strategy and the Common Agricultural Policy, which promote the sustainable management of natural resources. By valuing ecosystem services, the EU aims to enhance environmental protection while fostering economic growth and social equity.",
