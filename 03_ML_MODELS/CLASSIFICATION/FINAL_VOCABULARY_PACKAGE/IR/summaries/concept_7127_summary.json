  "summary": "The \"Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe,\" commonly referred to as the \"European Constitution,\" aimed to consolidate and streamline the legal framework of the European Union. Although it was signed in 2004, the treaty ultimately failed to be ratified by all member states, leading to its withdrawal. The European Constitution sought to enhance democratic legitimacy and improve decision-making processes within the EU by establishing a single legal personality and a clearer distribution of competencies among institutions. This concept remains significant in discussions surrounding EU governance and the evolution of its legal instruments, influencing subsequent treaties like the Treaty of Lisbon.",
