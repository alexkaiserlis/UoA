  "summary": "The concept of \"online game\" encompasses digital gaming experiences accessible via the internet, which have significant implications for social affairs within the EU. As online games proliferate, they raise regulatory challenges concerning consumer protection, data privacy, and age restrictions. The EU has initiated frameworks to address these issues, ensuring that online gaming platforms comply with legal standards that safeguard users, particularly minors. Furthermore, the rise of online gaming necessitates ongoing dialogue among member states to harmonize regulations, promote fair competition, and mitigate potential risks associated with gambling and addiction. Thus, \"online game\" is a pivotal concept in the evolving landscape of EU social policy.",
