  "summary": "The concept of \"access to education\" within the EU legal framework emphasizes the fundamental right to education as enshrined in various treaties and directives. It aims to ensure equitable opportunities for all individuals, regardless of socio-economic status, disability, or geographical location. The EU promotes policies that facilitate inclusive education systems, thereby enhancing social cohesion and combating discrimination. Regulatory measures, such as the European Accessibility Act, underscore the importance of removing barriers to educational institutions. This commitment to access aligns with broader EU objectives of fostering lifelong learning and empowering citizens through knowledge, ultimately contributing to a more educated and skilled workforce.",
