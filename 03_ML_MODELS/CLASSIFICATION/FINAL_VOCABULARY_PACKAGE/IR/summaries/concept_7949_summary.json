  "summary": "Outplacement refers to a structured support process provided by employers to assist employees in transitioning from their current roles, particularly during redundancies or organizational restructuring. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, outplacement services are increasingly recognized as a vital component of employment policy, promoting workforce adaptability and social cohesion. These services may include career counseling, job search assistance, and skills development, thereby facilitating the reintegration of displaced workers into the labor market. The EU encourages member states to adopt best practices in outplacement to enhance employment security and mitigate the adverse effects of unemployment on individuals and communities.",
