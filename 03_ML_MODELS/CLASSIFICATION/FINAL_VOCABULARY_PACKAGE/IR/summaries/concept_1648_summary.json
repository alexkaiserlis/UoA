  "summary": "Redundancy, in the context of EU employment law, refers to the situation where an employee's position is eliminated due to various factors, such as economic downturns or organizational restructuring. This concept is crucial in regulatory frameworks, as it dictates the rights of employees facing termination. The EU directives on collective redundancies require employers to consult with employee representatives and provide adequate notice and compensation. Additionally, redundancy procedures must comply with national laws that may offer further protections, ensuring that affected workers receive fair treatment and support during transitions. Understanding redundancy is essential for both employers and employees within the EU labor market.",
