It plays a crucial role in the broader context of defence policy, which is governed by various EU treaties and regulations aimed at ensuring collective security among member states. The air force is integral to NATO operations and EU missions, contributing to crisis management and peacekeeping efforts. Furthermore, the EU promotes cooperation among member states' air forces through initiatives like the European Defence Agency, enhancing interoperability and strategic capabilities in response to emerging security challenges.",
