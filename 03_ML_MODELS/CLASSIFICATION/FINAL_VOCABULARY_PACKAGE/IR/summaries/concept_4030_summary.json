  "summary": "The concept of \"external competence of the Community,\" now redirected to \"external competence (EU),\" pertains to the European Union's authority to engage in international relations and treaty-making. This competence is derived from the EU's legal framework, allowing it to act on behalf of its Member States in areas where it has been granted jurisdiction. The external competence encompasses various domains, including trade, environmental policy, and human rights, reflecting the EU's role as a global actor. Understanding this concept is crucial for interpreting EU legal documents and assessing the implications of its international agreements and partnerships.",
