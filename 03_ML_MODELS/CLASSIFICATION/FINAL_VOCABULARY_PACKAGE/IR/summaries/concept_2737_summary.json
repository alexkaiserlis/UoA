  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"product of animal origin\" is redirected to the preferred term \"animal product.\" This encompasses a wide range of items derived from animals, including those subjected to processes such as thawing or degreased treatments. Regulatory frameworks govern the safety and quality of these products, ensuring compliance with standards related to substances like dicyclanil and progestagen. Additionally, specific animal products may involve components like betaines or hexetidine, which are subject to scrutiny for their effects on health. The classification also includes rare ingredients such as cinchonae and frangulae, emphasizing the diverse nature of animal-derived substances in EU legislation.",
