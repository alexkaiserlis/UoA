  "summary": "The concept of \"marriage of convenience\" refers to a union primarily established for purposes other than love or companionship, often to gain legal benefits such as residency or citizenship within the EU. Such marriages may raise concerns regarding fraud and abuse of immigration laws, prompting regulatory scrutiny. The EU has implemented various legal frameworks to address these issues, ensuring that marriages are genuine and not solely for the purpose of circumventing immigration controls. Authorities may investigate the authenticity of these unions, balancing the right to family life with the need to prevent exploitation of legal provisions.",
