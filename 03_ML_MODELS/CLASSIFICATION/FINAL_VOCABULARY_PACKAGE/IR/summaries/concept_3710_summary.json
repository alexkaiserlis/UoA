In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the UNHCR's achievements in mobilization and monitoring are crucial for shaping policies on justice and home affairs (JHA). The organization specifies priorities for aid and support, ensuring that eligible individuals receive necessary resources, including food and transport. Resolutions from the UNHCR reveal lessons learned in the field, guiding future operations and practical preparations. The EU collaborates with the UNHCR to refine instruments that address refugee crises, carrying forward a commitment to humanitarian principles and justice.",
