Within the EU legal and regulatory framework, offshore oil activities are governed by a series of directives and regulations aimed at ensuring environmental protection, safety, and sustainable resource management. The EU emphasizes the need for stringent assessments and monitoring to mitigate risks associated with offshore drilling, including potential oil spills and ecological damage. Regulatory bodies oversee compliance with these standards, reflecting the EU's commitment to balancing energy needs with environmental stewardship in the oil industry.",
