  "summary": "The concept of \"transitional personnel reform,\" redirected to \"transitional justice,\" pertains to the legal and regulatory frameworks within the EU aimed at addressing past human rights violations and fostering societal reconciliation. Transitional justice encompasses a range of measures, including judicial and non-judicial processes, to ensure accountability, serve justice, and promote healing in post-conflict societies. In the EU context, these reforms are critical for establishing rule of law and protecting fundamental rights, particularly in member states undergoing significant political or social transitions. The focus on transitional justice underscores the EU's commitment to uphold democratic values and human dignity across its jurisdiction.",
