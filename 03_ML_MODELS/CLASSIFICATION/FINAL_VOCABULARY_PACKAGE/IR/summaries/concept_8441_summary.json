  "summary": "Asymmetric warfare refers to conflicts where opposing forces differ significantly in military capabilities, often leading to unconventional tactics employed by weaker parties. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, asymmetric warfare poses challenges to international security, necessitating robust legal responses. The EU must navigate complex issues such as the protection of civilians, the legality of countermeasures, and the implications of hybrid threats, which blend conventional and non-conventional tactics. This concept underscores the need for enhanced cooperation among member states and the development of comprehensive strategies to address the evolving landscape of security threats within the EU.",
