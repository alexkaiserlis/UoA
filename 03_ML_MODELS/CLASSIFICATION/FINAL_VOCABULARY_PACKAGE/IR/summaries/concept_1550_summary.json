  "summary": "The term \"case-law\" refers to the body of judicial decisions that interpret and apply legal principles within the European Union's legal framework. It plays a pivotal role in shaping EU law, as courts, particularly the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), establish precedents that guide future legal interpretations and regulatory applications. Case-law ensures consistency and coherence in the application of EU legislation across member states, influencing not only national courts but also the development of new legal standards. As a vital source of law, case-law reflects the dynamic interplay between legal norms and judicial interpretation in the EU context.",
