  "summary": "The concept of \"heavy industry\" within the EU regulatory framework pertains to sectors characterized by substantial capital investment and significant environmental impact. This includes industries such as steel, shipbuilding, and chemical production, which are subject to stringent regulations aimed at ensuring compliance with environmental standards and promoting sustainable practices. The EU's industrial policy seeks to balance economic growth with ecological responsibility, often through directives that govern emissions, waste management, and resource efficiency. Heavy industry plays a crucial role in the EU's economic landscape, necessitating robust legal mechanisms to address its challenges and opportunities in the context of the European Green Deal and industrial transformation initiatives.",
