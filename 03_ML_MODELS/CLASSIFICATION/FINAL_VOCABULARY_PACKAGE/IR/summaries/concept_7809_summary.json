  "summary": "Military law refers to the body of laws, regulations, and legal principles governing the armed forces within the European Union. It encompasses the legal framework that regulates military personnel, their conduct, and the organization of military operations. Military law is distinct from civilian law, focusing on discipline, military justice, and the rights and obligations of service members. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, military law plays a crucial role in ensuring compliance with international humanitarian law and the principles of proportionality and necessity in armed conflict. It also addresses issues related to military cooperation among EU member states.",
