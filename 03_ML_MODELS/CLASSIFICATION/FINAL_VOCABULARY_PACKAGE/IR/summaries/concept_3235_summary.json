  "summary": "The \"outflow of capital\" refers to the transfer of financial resources from one jurisdiction to another, which is a critical aspect of the EU's regulatory framework governing the free movement of capital. This concept is essential for ensuring that investors can freely allocate their assets across member states, fostering economic integration and competitiveness. The EU legal instruments aim to eliminate barriers to capital outflows, thereby promoting transparency and stability in financial markets. Regulatory measures are in place to monitor such outflows to prevent illicit activities, ensuring compliance with EU laws while safeguarding the integrity of the internal market.",
