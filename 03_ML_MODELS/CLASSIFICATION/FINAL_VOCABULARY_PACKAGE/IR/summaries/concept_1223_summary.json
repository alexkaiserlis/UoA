  "summary": "The concept of \"urban settlement,\" redirected to the preferred term \"urban habitat,\" encompasses the legal and regulatory frameworks governing the development and organization of urban areas within the EU. This term is pivotal in construction and town planning, as it addresses the integration of residential, commercial, and public spaces to foster sustainable living environments. EU regulations often emphasize the importance of harmonizing urban habitats with environmental considerations, promoting social cohesion, and ensuring accessibility. By focusing on urban habitats, EU policies aim to enhance the quality of life for residents while addressing challenges such as urban sprawl and infrastructure sustainability.",
