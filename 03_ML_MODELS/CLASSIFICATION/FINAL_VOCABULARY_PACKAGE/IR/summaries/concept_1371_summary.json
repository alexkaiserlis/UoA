  "summary": "The \"machine-tool industry,\" categorized under mechanical engineering (NACE), plays a critical role in the EU's economic landscape, particularly in regions like Midtjylland, Denmark. This sector is essential for manufacturing machinery and equipment that comply with global standards. In response to economic crises, the EU mobilises structural funds to assist redundant workers through reintegration programs, addressing redundancies and labour market changes. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) proposes budgetary contributions to support enterprises in adapting to globalisation. As part of interinstitutional efforts, the industry undergoes revisions to broaden its operational capacity, ensuring it remains competitive in a rapidly evolving world.",
