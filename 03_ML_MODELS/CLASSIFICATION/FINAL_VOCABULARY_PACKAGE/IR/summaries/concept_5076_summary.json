  "summary": "The Azores, an archipelago of Portugal, are classified as a region of the EU Member States, specifically under the category of 7211. This biogeographical area is characterized by its unique ecosystems and agricultural practices, including the cultivation of meloa and verdelho. The EU's regulatory framework supports the Azorean economy through interventions that stabilize local markets and promote the mechanisation of agricultural processes. Additionally, the region's remoter islands face challenges such as compartmentalization and the need for diversifying economic activities. The cohesiveness of the Azorean community is essential for sustainable development, ensuring that the benefits of EU policies materialise effectively while addressing the specific needs of its inhabitants.",
