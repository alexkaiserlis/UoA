  "summary": "Sexual tourism refers to the practice of traveling to another country with the intent to engage in sexual activities, often exploiting local laws and socio-economic conditions. Within the context of EU criminal law, this concept raises significant legal and regulatory concerns, particularly regarding human trafficking, child exploitation, and the promotion of illegal activities. The European Union has implemented various directives aimed at combating sexual tourism, emphasizing the need for member states to harmonize their legal frameworks to effectively address these crimes. Enhanced cooperation among EU countries is crucial to prevent and prosecute offenders, ensuring the protection of vulnerable populations.",
