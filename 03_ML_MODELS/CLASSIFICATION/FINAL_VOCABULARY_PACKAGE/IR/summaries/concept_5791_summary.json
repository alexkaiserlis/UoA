  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"weed\" is redirected to \"harmful plant,\" reflecting its classification as an organism that poses a danger to natural environments, particularly forests. This includes various vectors such as amauromyza and liriomyza, which can adversely affect trees like elm and conifers. The presence of pests, including bursaphelenchus and ceratocystis, necessitates protective measures to combat their spread. Regulatory frameworks often schedule specific harmful organisms, ensuring that consignors adhere to moisture and temperature controls to prevent their occurrence. The EU's commitment to maintaining biodiversity and productivity in ecosystems is essential, as these harmful plants can absolutely disrupt the balance of native flora.",
