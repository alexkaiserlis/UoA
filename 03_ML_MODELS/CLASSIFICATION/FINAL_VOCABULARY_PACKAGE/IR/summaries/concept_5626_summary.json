  "summary": "A \"unitarian State\" refers to a political framework characterized by a centralized government that holds the primary authority over the entire territory, as opposed to a federal system where power is distributed among various levels of government. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, the concept underscores the importance of uniformity in legislation and governance across member states. This centralization facilitates coherent policy implementation and regulatory compliance, ensuring that EU directives and regulations are uniformly applied. Understanding the implications of a unitarian State is crucial for analyzing the dynamics of governance within the EU and its impact on member state sovereignty.",
