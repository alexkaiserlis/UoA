  "summary": "The concept of \"distribution of seats,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"allocation of seats,\" pertains to the methodical assignment of parliamentary seats within the European Union's electoral framework. This process is governed by legal regulations that ensure equitable representation among member states, reflecting demographic and political considerations. The allocation of seats is crucial for maintaining the democratic integrity of the EU's decision-making bodies, particularly the European Parliament. It involves complex calculations based on population size and other factors, ensuring that smaller states are not disproportionately disadvantaged. This concept is foundational to electoral procedure and voting within the EU.",
