  "summary": "The \"EU regional policy\" is a pivotal framework aimed at addressing disparities among regions within the European Union, particularly in the context of economic development and social cohesion. This policy acknowledges the insularity and remoteness of certain areas, such as islands and rural regions, by implementing targeted measures for redispatching resources. Through composite strategies, the EU endeavors to foster prosperous communities by doubling investments in infrastructure and supporting shipbuilding industries. The execution of this policy involves collaboration among various stakeholders, including local governments and families, to ensure that vacant areas are reconstituted and that disparities are reduced. By classifying regions according to their specific needs, the EU aims to create a more equitable landscape, ultimately enhancing the overall well-being of its citizens.",
