  "summary": "The concept of \"wooded area\" pertains to regions characterized by a significant presence of trees and vegetation, playing a crucial role in EU forestry regulations. These areas are essential for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and sustainable land management. The EU's legal framework, including directives on habitat protection and forest management, emphasizes the preservation and sustainable use of wooded areas to combat climate change and promote ecological balance. Furthermore, the designation of wooded areas can influence funding allocations under various EU programs aimed at enhancing rural development and environmental sustainability. Understanding this concept is vital for compliance with EU environmental policies.",
