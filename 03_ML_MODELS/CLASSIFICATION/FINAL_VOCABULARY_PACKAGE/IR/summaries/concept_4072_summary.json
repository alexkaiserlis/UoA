  "summary": "The concept \"set intake figures,\" categorized under education, is a redirect to the preferred term \"selection of pupils.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept pertains to the established criteria and numerical limits governing the admission of students into educational institutions. These regulations aim to ensure equitable access to education while considering demographic factors and institutional capacities. The selection of pupils is critical for maintaining educational standards and fostering diversity within schools. Understanding this concept is essential for policymakers and educational authorities in the EU, as it directly influences educational planning and resource allocation.",
