  "summary": "Shore-based pilotage, also referred to as marine pilotage, is a critical component of transport policy within the European Union's regulatory framework. This concept encompasses the provision of navigational assistance to vessels by qualified pilots, who may operate from shore-based facilities rather than being physically present on board. The EU recognizes the importance of marine pilotage in ensuring maritime safety, environmental protection, and efficient shipping operations. Regulatory documents often address the standards and qualifications required for pilots, as well as the operational protocols that govern their activities, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of maritime transport within EU waters.",
