  "summary": "The concept of \"electric cable\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses a variety of insulated and stranded wires, crucial for electronic applications. These cables, often plaited and organized into bands, serve as the backbone for electrical engineering. The EU regulates importations of electric cables, invoking preferences and concessions to ensure safety and quality standards. Committees investigate the continuance of these regulations, addressing any injury that may threaten market stability. Accurate estimates of demand and supply are essential, as the market for electric cables sharply evolves. The holder of these cables must comply with EU directives to maintain entitlement and avoid penalties.",
