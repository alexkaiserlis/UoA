  "summary": "Tariff dismantling, also referred to as the suspension of customs duties, is a crucial aspect of the EU's 2011 tariff policy. This regulatory framework aims to cohesively manage trade by conditionally reducing or eliminating tariffs on specific goods, thereby facilitating investment and enhancing market access. The process can trigger countermeasures in response to alarmingly high tariffs imposed by external entities. In this context, the EU's approach is monolithic, focusing on absorbable impacts on sectors like microelectronics and proteinaceous products. The regulation also considers the extraterritorial implications of trade agreements, ensuring that member states, such as those in the Faroe Islands and Puntarenas, are not paralysed by excessive duties. Thus, tariff dismantling represents a strategic tool for stabilising trade relations while allowing for the grandfathering of existing agreements.",
