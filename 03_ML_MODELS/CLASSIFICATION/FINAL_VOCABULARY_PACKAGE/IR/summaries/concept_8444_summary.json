  "summary": "The concept of \"wolf\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to the protection of biodiversity and the natural environment. Wolves, as apex predators, play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance. The EU's Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) classifies the wolf as a species of community interest, necessitating conservation measures to ensure its survival and habitat preservation. This regulatory context underscores the importance of safeguarding natural ecosystems against threats such as habitat loss and poaching. Effective management strategies are essential for fostering coexistence between human activities and wolf populations, thereby contributing to the overall health of the natural environment in Europe.",
