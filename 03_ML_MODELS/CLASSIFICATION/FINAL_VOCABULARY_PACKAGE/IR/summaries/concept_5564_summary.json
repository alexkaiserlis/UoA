  "summary": "The concept of \"overlapping of income\" pertains to the phenomenon where multiple sources of income are simultaneously recognized within national accounts, potentially leading to distortions in economic data. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is crucial for ensuring accurate fiscal reporting and compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. Overlapping income can complicate the assessment of economic performance and public finances, necessitating clear guidelines to delineate income streams. This ensures transparency and reliability in national accounts, which are vital for informed policymaking and economic governance within the EU.",
