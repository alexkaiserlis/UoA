  "summary": "The term \"typhoon\" is categorized under the deterioration of the environment within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, specifically redirecting to the preferred term \"cyclone.\" Cyclones, including typhoons, are significant meteorological phenomena that can lead to severe environmental degradation, impacting ecosystems and human settlements. The EU addresses such natural disasters through various regulations aimed at disaster risk reduction and environmental protection. Understanding the implications of cyclones is crucial for effective policy-making, as these events can exacerbate climate change effects and challenge the EU's commitment to sustainability and resilience against environmental deterioration.",
