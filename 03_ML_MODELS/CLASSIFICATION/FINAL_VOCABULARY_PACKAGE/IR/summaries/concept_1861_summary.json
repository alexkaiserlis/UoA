  "summary": "The term \"megalopolis\" refers to a large, densely populated urban area that often encompasses multiple cities and their suburbs, forming a continuous metropolitan region. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, megalopolises present unique challenges and opportunities in construction and town planning. The European Union's policies on urban development emphasize sustainable growth, infrastructure investment, and environmental protection within these expansive urban environments. Effective governance in megalopolises requires coordination among various stakeholders, including local authorities and regional planners, to address issues such as transportation, housing, and public services, ensuring that urbanization aligns with EU objectives for cohesion and sustainability.",
