  "summary": "The \"free movement of workers,\" a fundamental principle enshrined in EU law, consolidates the rights of employees, including hairdressers and other professionals, to reside and work across member states. This regulation facilitates the mobility of migrants and job seekers, enabling them to pursue vacant positions and broaden their professional choices. By simplifying the process for operatives and specialists, it promotes lifelong learning and enhances the aggregation of skills within the EU labor market. Unions and cooperatives play a vital role in defending workers' rights, while the regulatory framework addresses issues such as pension and sickness benefits for posted workers. This principle supersedes national barriers, fostering a dynamic workforce that contributes to economic growth.",
