  "summary": "The concept of \"foreign exchange,\" redirected to \"foreign currency,\" is critical in EU monetary economics. It encompasses transactions involving the conversion of one currency into another, addressing liquidity and facilitating international trade. The EU aims to stabilize currency flows, particularly during periods of economic disturbances, which can aggravate deficits. Regulatory frameworks propose compulsory authorizations for transactions, ensuring validity and compliance. The abolition of barriers to foreign currency transactions is essential for mutual recovery in the market. Financial institutions must address the seasonal cycles of currency demand, bearing in mind the critical need for swift and efficient transactions to avoid frozen assets and ensure smooth operations.",
