  "summary": "The concept of \"just transition\" within EU environmental policy emphasizes the need for equitable and inclusive approaches to environmental sustainability. It seeks to ensure that the shift towards a low-carbon economy does not disproportionately impact vulnerable communities or workers in carbon-intensive sectors. This regulatory framework advocates for social justice, economic resilience, and the creation of green jobs, facilitating a transition that is both environmentally sound and socially responsible. The EU's commitment to a just transition is reflected in various legal instruments and funding mechanisms aimed at supporting affected regions and promoting sustainable development while addressing climate change challenges.",
