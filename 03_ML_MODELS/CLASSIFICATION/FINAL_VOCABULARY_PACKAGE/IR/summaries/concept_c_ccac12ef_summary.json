  "summary": "The concept of \"roaming service,\" commonly referred to simply as \"roaming,\" pertains to the ability of mobile users to access telecommunications services while traveling outside their home network's coverage area. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, roaming services are governed by regulations aimed at ensuring fair pricing and consumer protection. The EU has implemented measures to eliminate excessive roaming charges, promoting seamless connectivity across member states. This regulatory oversight is crucial for fostering a single digital market and enhancing consumer rights, ensuring that users can communicate without incurring prohibitive costs while traveling within the EU.",
