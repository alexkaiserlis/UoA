  "summary": "The concept of \"non-polluting vehicle\" within the EU legal framework refers to vehicles that produce zero emissions during operation, thereby contributing to environmental sustainability and compliance with stringent EU environmental policy objectives. These vehicles are pivotal in the EU's strategy to mitigate air pollution and combat climate change, aligning with directives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector. The promotion of non-polluting vehicles is supported through various regulatory measures, including incentives for manufacturers and consumers, as well as investments in charging infrastructure. This concept is integral to achieving the EU's long-term goals for a cleaner, more sustainable transport system.",
