  "summary": "The concept of \"voting intentions\" pertains to the anticipatory expressions of preferences by voters regarding electoral choices within the framework of electoral procedure and voting in the European Union. It serves as a critical indicator for political analysts and regulatory bodies, reflecting public sentiment prior to elections. Understanding voting intentions is essential for the formulation of electoral strategies and the assessment of democratic engagement. In EU legal contexts, these intentions may influence regulatory measures aimed at ensuring fair electoral processes, thereby reinforcing the integrity of democratic institutions. Consequently, accurate analysis of voting intentions can significantly impact policy-making and electoral outcomes.",
