  "summary": "The concept of \"literary and artistic property\" encompasses the rights of authors and creators over their works, including compositions, lyrics, and phonograms. Within the EU legal framework, this concept is governed by regulations that ensure creators can recoup royalties from various genres, such as jazz, rock, and opera. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties, including the WCT and WPPT, facilitate the protection of these rights, ensuring that performers and composers retain unwaivable rights over their fixations and reproductions. This legal structure aims to rebalance the distribution of royalties, allowing for collaborative works while protecting the interests of surviving authors and performers.",
