  "summary": "Industrial concentration refers to the process whereby a significant portion of an industry is controlled by a limited number of firms, leading to reduced competition and potential monopolistic practices. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, industrial concentration is scrutinized under competition law, particularly by the European Commission, to prevent anti-competitive behavior that could harm consumers and the internal market. The assessment of mergers and acquisitions is crucial, as it aims to maintain a balanced industrial structure that fosters innovation and economic growth while ensuring fair competition. Thus, industrial concentration is a vital concept in EU policy aimed at safeguarding market integrity.",
