  "summary": "The concept of \"Caribbean Netherlands\" refers to the special status of Bonaire, Saint Eustatius, and Saba, which are classified as overseas countries and territories of the Netherlands. This classification follows the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles and recognizes these islands as integral parts of the Dutch state, albeit with distinct legal arrangements. In EU legal and regulatory contexts, these territories benefit from the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP), allowing for preferential tariff treatment. Their status is vital for statistical purposes and impacts their eligibility for various EU funding and development schemes. The relationship to the preferred term underscores their unique position within the EU framework.",
