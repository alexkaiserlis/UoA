  "summary": "The concept of \"residential area\" pertains to zones designated primarily for housing within urban and rural environments, as outlined in EU construction and town planning regulations. These areas are subject to specific legal frameworks that govern land use, zoning, and urban development, ensuring compliance with environmental standards and community planning objectives. The designation of a residential area influences infrastructure development, public services, and the overall quality of life for inhabitants. EU directives may also dictate the integration of sustainable practices within these areas, promoting eco-friendly construction and urban renewal initiatives to enhance livability and community cohesion.",
