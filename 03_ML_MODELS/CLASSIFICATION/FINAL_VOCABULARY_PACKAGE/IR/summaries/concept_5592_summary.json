  "summary": "\"Discrimination on the basis of nationality\" is a fundamental principle enshrined in EU law, aimed at safeguarding the rights of nationals within the internal market. This concept entails the prohibition of treating individuals unfavorably due to their nationality, which poses significant implications for employment, residence, and access to services. The EU's liberalisation efforts seek to abolish barriers that restrict the movement of individuals and their assets, ensuring that all nationals enjoy equal treatment. Safeguards are necessary to protect beneficiaries from exploitation and to ensure that firms and farmers can compete on a level playing field. The progressive attainment of these rights necessitates the correct implementation of regulations, specifying conditions under which discrimination is deemed unacceptable.",
