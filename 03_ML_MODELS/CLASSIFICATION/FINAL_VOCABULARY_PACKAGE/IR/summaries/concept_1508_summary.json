  "summary": "The Eurovoc concept \"Mohammedanism\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"Islam,\" which is recognized as a major world religion and cultural system. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, Islam is significant for its implications on cultural diversity, anti-discrimination policies, and the promotion of religious tolerance. The EU acknowledges the importance of understanding various religious practices, including Islam, to foster social cohesion and respect for fundamental rights. This redirect underscores the evolving terminology in legal discourse, reflecting a commitment to accuracy and inclusivity in the representation of cultural and religious identities within EU legislation.",
