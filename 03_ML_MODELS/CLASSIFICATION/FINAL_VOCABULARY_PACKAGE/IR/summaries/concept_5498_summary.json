  "summary": "The \"codification of EU law\" refers to the systematic consolidation and organization of European Union legal texts, aimed at enhancing clarity and accessibility for stakeholders, including entrepreneurs and rightholders. This process methodically addresses issues such as nullity and illegality, ensuring that legal frameworks underlie the principles of justice and compliance. By tarification of various regulations, the codification seeks to eliminate prejudices against defaulting debtors and offenders. It also involves the decompilation of complex legal jargon into more comprehensible formats, making previously illegible documents accessible. Ultimately, this initiative contributes to a more coherent legal landscape, benefiting all parties involved, including those in agriculture and fisheries, while promoting aesthetic and logical coherence in legal documentation.",
