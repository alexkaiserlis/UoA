  "summary": "The term \"2G\" refers to the second generation of mobile telecommunications technology, which is significant in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks governing communications. This technology, characterized by digital signal processing, enabled enhanced mobile voice services and basic data services. In the EU, regulatory bodies oversee the allocation of spectrum and ensure compliance with interoperability standards to facilitate seamless communication across member states. The evolution from 2G to more advanced technologies, such as 3G and 4G, has prompted ongoing discussions about regulatory adaptations necessary to address emerging challenges in telecommunications, including security, privacy, and consumer protection.",
