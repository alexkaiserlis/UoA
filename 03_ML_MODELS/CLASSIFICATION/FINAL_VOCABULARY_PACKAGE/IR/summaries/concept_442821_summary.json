This framework establishes protocols for cooperation, focusing on multiannual financial commitments and disbursements allocated for development projects. Meetings among ministers assess the performance of these initiatives, ensuring that funds are effectively utilized. The partnership aims to foster economic growth and sustainable development, with representatives from both sides laying out exact procedures for the realization of agreed objectives. The Luxembourg meeting highlighted the importance of internal mechanisms to review and enhance cooperation, thereby strengthening the ACP-EU relationship.",
