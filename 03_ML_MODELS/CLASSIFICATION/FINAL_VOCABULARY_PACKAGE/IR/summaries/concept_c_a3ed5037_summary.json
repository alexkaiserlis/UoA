  "summary": "Femicide, categorized under criminal law, refers to the gender-based killing of women, often rooted in systemic violence and discrimination. Within the EU legal framework, femicide is increasingly recognized as a severe violation of human rights, prompting member states to adopt comprehensive measures for prevention, protection, and prosecution. The European Union has initiated various directives and regulations aimed at combating violence against women, thereby addressing the underlying societal norms that perpetuate such acts. By integrating femicide into broader discussions on gender equality and justice, the EU seeks to enhance legal responses and foster a safer environment for all women across its member states.",
