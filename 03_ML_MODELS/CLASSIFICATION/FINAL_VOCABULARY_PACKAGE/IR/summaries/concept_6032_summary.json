  "summary": "Collectivism, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to an economic structure that emphasizes collective ownership and management of resources and means of production. This concept contrasts with individualism, promoting the idea that economic activities should benefit the community as a whole rather than individual profit. In EU policies, collectivism can influence social cohesion, labor rights, and economic equality, particularly in discussions surrounding cooperative enterprises and social enterprises. The EU's commitment to social market economy principles often intersects with collectivist ideals, fostering a regulatory environment that supports collective initiatives aimed at enhancing social welfare and economic stability.",
