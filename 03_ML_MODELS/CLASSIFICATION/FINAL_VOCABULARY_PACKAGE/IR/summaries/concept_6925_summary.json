  "summary": "The concept of \"prisoner work\" within the framework of EU criminal law pertains to the engagement of incarcerated individuals in labor activities as part of their rehabilitation and reintegration into society. This practice is governed by various EU directives and national regulations, which aim to ensure that such work is conducted under humane conditions, respects prisoners' rights, and contributes to their skill development. The overarching goal is to reduce recidivism rates by providing inmates with vocational training and work experience, thereby facilitating their successful transition post-release. The legal discourse surrounding prisoner work emphasizes balancing punishment with rehabilitation, aligning with broader EU principles of human rights and social justice.",
