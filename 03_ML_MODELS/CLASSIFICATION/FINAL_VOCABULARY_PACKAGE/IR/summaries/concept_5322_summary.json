  "summary": "The concept of \"commemoration\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the cultural significance of commemorative events and issuances. This includes the issuance of commemorative coins and banknotes that celebrate historical anniversaries or notable figures, such as George Patton or the Lipizzaner horses. These denominations are carefully devised to distinguishable features that resonate with cultural heritage, enhancing their acceptability among collectors. Commemorating events, such as equestrian competitions or historical races, fosters a sense of identity and unity. The EU periodically endorses such initiatives, recommending that member states consult on the cultural implications and ensure that presentations fit within broader cultural policies, thereby aggregating cultural values across the Union.",
