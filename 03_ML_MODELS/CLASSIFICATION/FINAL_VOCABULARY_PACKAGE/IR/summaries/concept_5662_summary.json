It plays a crucial role in understanding the evolution of EU law and institutions, particularly in relation to human rights, integration processes, and socio-political dynamics. By analyzing contemporary history, policymakers can glean insights that inform legislative actions and regulatory measures, ensuring that they are responsive to the lessons of the past.
