  "summary": "The \"Turks and Caicos Islands\" refer to a specific category of overseas countries and territories (OCTs) recognized by the European Union. This region, governed by the United Kingdom, is subject to EU regulations that allow for derogations and special rules regarding trade and export. The islands' ability to export goods, such as rice, is influenced by their status, which warrants a unique administrative approach. Under the Association of Caribbean States (ACS) framework, the definition of originating products is crucial for cumulation purposes. The EU's regulatory framework justifies these measures to support local industries, ensuring compliance with established codes while promoting economic development in the region.",
