  "summary": "The concept of \"ocean\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the vast bodies of saltwater that cover significant portions of the Earth’s surface, influencing biodiversity, climate, and ecological balance. The EU recognizes the ocean's critical role in natural environment conservation, particularly through directives aimed at marine protection and sustainable resource management. Legal instruments such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive emphasize the need for integrated maritime policies to safeguard ocean health. Furthermore, the EU’s commitment to international agreements underscores the importance of collaborative efforts in addressing oceanic challenges, including pollution and overfishing, thereby promoting a sustainable marine ecosystem.",
