  "summary": "The term \"parliamentary chamber\" refers to a distinct legislative body within the broader framework of a parliament, particularly in the context of the European Union. Each Member State may have its own parliamentary chambers, which play a crucial role in the legislative process, including the formulation and adoption of laws. In the EU, the European Parliament serves as a prominent example of a parliamentary chamber, where elected representatives deliberate on various legislative proposals. This chamber is instrumental in ensuring democratic accountability and representation within the EU's regulatory framework, thereby influencing the development of EU law and policy.",
