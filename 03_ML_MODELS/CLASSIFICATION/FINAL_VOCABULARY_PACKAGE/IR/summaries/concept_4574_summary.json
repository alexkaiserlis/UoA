  "summary": "In the context of EU competition law, \"trust\" refers to the reliance and confidence that market participants place in the integrity and fairness of competitive practices. This concept is pivotal in regulatory frameworks aimed at fostering a level playing field, where businesses can compete without undue influence or manipulation. The EU's legal instruments, such as the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), emphasize the importance of maintaining trust among consumers and enterprises alike. Ensuring transparency and accountability in market operations is essential for sustaining this trust, thereby promoting healthy competition and innovation within the internal market.",
