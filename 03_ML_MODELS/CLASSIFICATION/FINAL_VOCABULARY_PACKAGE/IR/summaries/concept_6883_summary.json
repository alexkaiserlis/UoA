  "summary": "Oligarchy, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to a political system where power resides in the hands of a small, elite group. This concentration of authority can lead to governance that prioritizes the interests of a few over the broader populace, potentially undermining democratic principles. The EU's commitment to democratic governance necessitates vigilance against oligarchic tendencies, ensuring that decision-making processes remain transparent and inclusive. Regulatory measures may be implemented to prevent the emergence of oligarchic structures, thereby promoting equitable representation and participation in the political sphere, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the EU's democratic values.",
