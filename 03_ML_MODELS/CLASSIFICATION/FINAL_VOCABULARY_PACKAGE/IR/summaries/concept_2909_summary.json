  "summary": "The concept of \"assistance in training\" within the EU's cooperation policy framework pertains to the provision of practical expertise and support to institutions involved in the implementation of Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) actions. This assistance is often formalized through agreements that set specific conditions for training initiatives, which may include military staff and other personnel. Such arrangements are crucial for enhancing the operational capacity of member states in the field of security. The adoption of these training programs is based on decisions made by the Council, as outlined in treaties and declarations signed by the Union.",
