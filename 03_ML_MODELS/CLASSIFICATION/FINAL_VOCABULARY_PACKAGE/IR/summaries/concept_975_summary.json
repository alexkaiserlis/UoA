  "summary": "The term \"housewife\" refers to a demographic category within the EU's regulatory framework, particularly in discussions surrounding family structures and gender roles in society. In legal contexts, the concept encompasses the socio-economic contributions of individuals primarily engaged in domestic responsibilities, often without formal employment. This demographic is crucial for understanding population dynamics and the implications of policies affecting labor market participation, social security, and gender equality. The recognition of housewives in EU legal documents underscores the importance of inclusive policies that address the needs and rights of all family members, thereby promoting a comprehensive approach to demographic analysis and social welfare.",
