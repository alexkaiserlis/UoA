  "summary": "The \"law of outer space\" refers to the body of international legal principles governing activities in outer space, primarily established by treaties such as the Outer Space Treaty of 1967. This legal framework is crucial for ensuring the peaceful use of outer space, promoting cooperation among states, and protecting celestial bodies from harmful contamination. Within the EU regulatory context, adherence to these principles is essential for member states engaged in space exploration and satellite deployment. The EU also plays a role in shaping space law through its policies and initiatives, fostering compliance with international obligations while advancing its own strategic interests in outer space activities.",
