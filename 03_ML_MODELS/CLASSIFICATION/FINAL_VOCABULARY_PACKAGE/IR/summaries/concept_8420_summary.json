  "summary": "The concept of \"leaving the scene of an accident,\" commonly referred to as \"hit-and-run,\" pertains to a criminal act where an individual involved in a vehicular incident fails to stop and provide necessary information or assistance. In the context of EU criminal law, this offense is treated with severity due to its implications for public safety and accountability. Member States are encouraged to harmonize their legal frameworks to ensure consistent penalties and enforcement mechanisms. The regulatory approach aims to deter such behavior, promote road safety, and protect victims' rights across the EU, thereby enhancing legal coherence in transnational contexts.",
