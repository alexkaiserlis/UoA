  "summary": "The term \"national parliament\" refers to the legislative body within a member state of the European Union, responsible for enacting laws, scrutinizing the government, and representing citizens' interests. National parliaments play a crucial role in the EU's multi-level governance system, particularly in the context of the subsidiarity principle, which dictates that decisions should be made at the most local level possible. They engage in the legislative process by reviewing EU proposals and ensuring compliance with national interests. Furthermore, national parliaments contribute to the democratic legitimacy of the EU by facilitating dialogue between citizens and EU institutions, thereby enhancing accountability and transparency in governance.",
