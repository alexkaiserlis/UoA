  "summary": "The concept of \"study fees,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"school fees,\" pertains to the financial obligations imposed on students for educational services within the EU's regulatory framework. These fees are integral to the organisation of teaching, influencing access to education and the sustainability of educational institutions. In the context of EU legal documents, school fees are often examined concerning compliance with non-discrimination principles and the right to education. Regulatory measures may address the transparency and fairness of fee structures, ensuring that they do not hinder equitable access to quality education across member states.",
