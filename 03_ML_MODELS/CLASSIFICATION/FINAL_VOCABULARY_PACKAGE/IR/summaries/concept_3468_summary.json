  "summary": "A \"multilateral convention,\" often redirected to \"international convention,\" refers to legally binding agreements among multiple states, crucial for addressing global challenges. In the EU context, such conventions dynamically facilitate cooperation on issues like environmental sustainability, urbanism, and public health. For instance, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) exemplifies a multilateral effort to implement a preambular framework for nuclear disarmament. These conventions may also address specific sectors, such as the conservation of anadromous species or the regulation of substances like cyanocobalamin. The EU actively nominates proposals to enhance international collaboration, ensuring that member states engage in swifter and more effective implementation of these agreements.",
