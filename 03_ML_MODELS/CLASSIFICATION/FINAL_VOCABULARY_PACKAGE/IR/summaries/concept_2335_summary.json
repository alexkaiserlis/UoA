  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"wife\" is redirected to the preferred term \"married person,\" reflecting a broader and more inclusive understanding of marital status. This shift underscores the importance of gender-neutral language in legal documents, ensuring that rights and obligations apply equally to all married individuals, regardless of gender. The concept of a \"married person\" encompasses various legal implications, including inheritance rights, tax benefits, and social security entitlements, which are crucial for the protection of family units within EU member states. This alignment with contemporary legal standards promotes equality and non-discrimination in family law across the EU.",
