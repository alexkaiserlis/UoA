  "summary": "A \"commercial transaction\" refers to any exchange of goods, services, or financial assets between parties, governed by legal frameworks that ensure compliance with EU regulations. These transactions are pivotal in the marketing domain, as they establish the terms of trade and consumer protection. In the EU context, commercial transactions must adhere to directives such as the Consumer Rights Directive and the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which aim to promote fair competition and safeguard consumer interests. Understanding the legal implications of commercial transactions is essential for businesses operating within the EU single market, ensuring transparency and accountability in their dealings.",
