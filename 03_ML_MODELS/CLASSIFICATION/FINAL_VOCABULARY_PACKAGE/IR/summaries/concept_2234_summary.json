  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"rolling stock\" refers to the mobile equipment used in rail transport, including locomotives and carriages. This concept is governed by various legislative instruments that specify the standards and requirements for rolling stock to ensure safety and interoperability across member states. The integration of rolling stock into the railway system is crucial for mutual recognition and acceptance among contracting organisations, particularly as new regulations are negotiated. Issues such as insolvency and the transfer of ownership can impact rolling stock, necessitating judicial declarations and approvals. The competence of member states, including Croatia, Denmark, and Ireland, is essential in dealing with matters related to rolling stock, ensuring that all parts are correctly specified and bound by exclusive agreements.",
