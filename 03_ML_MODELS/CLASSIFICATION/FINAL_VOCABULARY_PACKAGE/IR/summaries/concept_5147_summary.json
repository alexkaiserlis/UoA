  "summary": "The term \"factor of production\" refers to the essential inputs used in the production of goods and services within the EU economy. These factors typically include land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, understanding factors of production is crucial for formulating policies that promote economic growth, ensure sustainable development, and enhance competitiveness. Regulatory measures may address the efficient allocation and utilization of these factors, impacting various sectors. The EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and industrial regulations exemplify how the management of factors of production is vital for achieving broader economic objectives and compliance with EU standards.",
