  "summary": "The concept of \"media,\" as categorized under communications in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, is primarily redirected to the preferred term \"mass media.\" This encompasses various forms of communication that mobilise public discourse and influence societal patterns. In the context of globalisation, mass media plays a crucial role in disseminating information across regions, including the Netherlands and Brabant. The EU's structural funds, such as the European Globalisation Fund (EGF), assist enterprises facing redundancies and support workers' reintegration during crises. Regulatory revisions allow for budgetary contributions to enhance media operations, ensuring compliance with interinstitutional standards and promoting sound practices within the sector.",
