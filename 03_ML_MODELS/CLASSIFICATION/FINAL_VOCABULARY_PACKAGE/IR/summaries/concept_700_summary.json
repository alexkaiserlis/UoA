  "summary": "The concept of \"national election\" pertains to the electoral procedure and voting processes within EU member states, reflecting the democratic commitment of the Union. Such elections are crucial for the appointment of representatives in national assemblies, which play a significant role in the governance of the republic. The constitutional framework governing these elections remains a subject of ongoing developments, noted for their contingent nature and the necessity for positive action towards democratic transition. The Council of the European Union often expresses concern regarding the application of electoral standards, particularly in relation to extending support for fair elections. The decision-making process surrounding national elections is influenced by various treaties, with implications for the current situation in member states.",
