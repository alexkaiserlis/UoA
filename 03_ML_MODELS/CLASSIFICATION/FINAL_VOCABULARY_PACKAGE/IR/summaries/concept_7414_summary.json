  "summary": "The concept of \"civil union\" within the EU legal framework pertains to a legally recognized partnership between individuals, often providing similar rights and responsibilities as marriage. Civil unions can encompass various forms of cohabitation, including same-sex partnerships, and are significant in the context of family law. While the EU does not have a uniform regulation governing civil unions, member states have the discretion to legislate on this matter, leading to diverse legal interpretations and protections. This variability can impact cross-border recognition and the rights of individuals in civil unions, highlighting the need for harmonization in EU family law to ensure equitable treatment across jurisdictions.",
