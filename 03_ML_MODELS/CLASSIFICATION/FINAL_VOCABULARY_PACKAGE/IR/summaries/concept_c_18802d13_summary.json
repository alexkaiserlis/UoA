  "summary": "Ecodesign is a pivotal concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, primarily aimed at enhancing the environmental performance of products throughout their lifecycle. It encompasses the integration of environmental considerations into product design, promoting sustainability and resource efficiency. The Ecodesign Directive (2009/125/EC) establishes requirements for energy-related products, mandating that manufacturers assess and minimize the ecological impact of their offerings. This regulatory approach not only fosters innovation in technology and technical regulations but also aligns with the EU's broader objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting circular economy principles. Ultimately, ecodesign serves as a crucial mechanism for achieving environmental sustainability in the EU market.",
