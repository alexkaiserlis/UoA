  "summary": "The \"internal border of the EU\" refers to the regulated frontiers within the European Union, facilitating fluidity in the movement of goods and individuals. These borders, unlike external ones, are designed to enhance interaction among member states, minimizing tolls and fiscal barriers. The internal borders are codified to ensure that luggage and goods destined for various locations can cross without excessive verifications or delays. This framework aims to recover the efficacy of trade while maintaining sovereign rights. The concept is crucial for organizing the EU’s internal market, ensuring that disturbances are effectively managed and that taxpayers benefit from a seamless, rationality-driven system.",
