  "summary": "The concept of \"casual work,\" redirected to \"casual employment,\" refers to a form of employment characterized by irregular hours and a lack of long-term commitment between the employer and employee. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, casual employment is often associated with flexible labor markets, allowing for adaptability in workforce management. However, this type of employment raises concerns regarding workers' rights, including access to social protections and benefits. The EU has been increasingly focused on ensuring that casual employment does not lead to exploitation, promoting fair labor practices while balancing the needs of employers for flexibility.",
