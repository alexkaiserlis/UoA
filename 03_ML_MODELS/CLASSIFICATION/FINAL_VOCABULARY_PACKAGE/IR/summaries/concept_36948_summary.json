  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the term \"citizen\" refers to an individual who holds the legal status of membership within a state, thereby conferring specific rights and responsibilities. Citizens are integral to the functioning of executive power and public service, as they participate in democratic processes and benefit from various protections under EU law. The concept encompasses rights such as free movement, non-discrimination, and access to public services, which are essential for fostering civic engagement and ensuring accountability within governance structures. Consequently, the status of a citizen is pivotal for the realization of EU objectives related to integration and social cohesion.",
