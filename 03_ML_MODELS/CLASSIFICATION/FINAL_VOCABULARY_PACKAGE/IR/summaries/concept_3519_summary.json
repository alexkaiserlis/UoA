It aims to align human resources with organizational objectives, ensuring that the right number of skilled workers is available to meet economic demands. This concept is crucial in regulatory contexts, as it informs policies related to labor market dynamics, vocational training, and employment legislation. Effective manpower planning contributes to reducing unemployment rates and enhancing productivity, thereby supporting the EU's broader economic goals.
