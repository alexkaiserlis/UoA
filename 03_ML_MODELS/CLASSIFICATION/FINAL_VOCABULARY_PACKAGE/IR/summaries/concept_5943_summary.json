  "summary": "The \"third stage of EMU\" refers to the advanced phase of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), where member jurisdictions irrevocably adopt a single currency, the euro. This stage implies a consolidation of monetary policies under the European Central Bank (ESCB) and necessitates adherence to statutes that govern inflation and fiscal sustainability. The transition involves complex computations and algorithms to ensure nominal stability, addressing potential inaccuracies and rounding issues. Member states, attending to their intentions, must navigate the presumption of unanimity in decision-making. The changeover is meant to facilitate a robust economic environment, thereby reducing deficits and enhancing financial dialogue among the fifteen participating countries.",
