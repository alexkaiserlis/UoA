  "summary": "The concept of \"foreign language\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the teaching and learning of languages that are not native to the learners. This is particularly relevant in the context of fostering multilingualism, which is a cornerstone of EU policy aimed at enhancing communication among member states. The promotion of foreign language education is crucial for ensuring effective participation in the single market and for the integration of diverse cultures within the EU. Furthermore, the ability to communicate in foreign languages is essential for legal professionals operating in a multilingual legal environment, ensuring compliance with EU regulations and directives.",
