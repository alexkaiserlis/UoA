  "summary": "French Guiana, categorized under overseas countries and territories, plays a significant role in EU legal and regulatory frameworks. This region has witnessed various initiatives aimed at regularisation and reclaiming unaccounted plots for sustainable development. The Guianese population faces challenges such as dengue outbreaks, necessitating the use of insecticidal acaricides like malathion to combat mosquitoes. Regulatory measures also address the production and distribution of alcohols, including rums, with specific cotisation and vignette requirements. The topography of French Guiana generates unique ecological conditions, which are critical in forecasting and managing environmental impacts. Overall, French Guiana's integration into EU policies reflects a commitment to undistorted economic growth and social sécurité.",
