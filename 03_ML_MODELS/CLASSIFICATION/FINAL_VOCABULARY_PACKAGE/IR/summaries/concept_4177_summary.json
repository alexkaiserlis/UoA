  "summary": "The \"vice-president of an institution\" within the EU framework plays a crucial role in governance, often appointed to assist the president in various capacities. This position entails advising councils and boards, assessing candidatures, and chairing panels that discuss significant topics. Vice-presidents must navigate potential conflicts of interest, ensuring their independence while managing emoluments and salaries. They are responsible for certifying decisions and may abstain from votes to maintain impartiality. The role also involves engaging with judges and tribunals, particularly in prejudicial matters. As they endeavour to uphold the institution's integrity, vice-presidents contribute to the design of policies that impact retirement and pensions for EU civil servants.",
