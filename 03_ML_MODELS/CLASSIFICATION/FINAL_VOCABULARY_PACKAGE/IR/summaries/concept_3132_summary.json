  "summary": "The \"dumping of waste\" refers to the unlawful disposal of waste materials in environments not designated for such purposes, contravening EU environmental policy. This practice poses significant risks to ecosystems, public health, and biodiversity. EU regulations, including the Waste Framework Directive, establish stringent guidelines to prevent illegal dumping and promote sustainable waste management practices. The concept is integral to the EU's commitment to environmental protection, emphasizing the need for proper waste treatment and disposal methods. Effective enforcement mechanisms are essential to combat dumping, ensuring compliance with environmental standards and fostering a circular economy within the EU.",
