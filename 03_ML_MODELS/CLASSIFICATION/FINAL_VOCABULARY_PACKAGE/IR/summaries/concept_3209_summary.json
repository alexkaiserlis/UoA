  "summary": "The concept of \"professional relations,\" redirected to the preferred term \"labour relations,\" encompasses the legal frameworks governing interactions between employers and employees within the EU. This area of labour law addresses the rights and obligations of both parties, facilitating equitable negotiations and dispute resolution. The regulatory landscape includes directives and regulations aimed at promoting fair treatment, collective bargaining, and social dialogue. By establishing standards for professional relations, the EU seeks to enhance workplace harmony and protect workers' rights, thereby fostering a balanced labour market. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for compliance and effective management in the context of EU legislation.",
