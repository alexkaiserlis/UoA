  "summary": "The concept of \"political split\" refers to a division within a political party, often resulting from ideological differences or strategic disagreements. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a political split can significantly impact party cohesion, electoral strategies, and legislative effectiveness. Such splits may lead to the formation of splinter groups or factions, which can alter the dynamics of political representation within the European Parliament. Understanding political splits is crucial for analyzing party behavior, voter alignment, and the overall stability of political systems in EU member states, as they can influence policy-making and governance at both national and EU levels.",
