  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the term \"slag\" is redirected to the preferred term \"metal by-product.\" Slag refers to the non-metallic by-product generated during the smelting process in the iron, steel, and other metal industries. It is essential for regulatory compliance, particularly concerning waste management and recycling initiatives under EU directives. The classification of slag as a metal by-product facilitates its reuse and valorization, aligning with the EU's circular economy objectives. Understanding this concept is crucial for industries aiming to adhere to environmental standards and optimize resource efficiency within the EU regulatory landscape.",
