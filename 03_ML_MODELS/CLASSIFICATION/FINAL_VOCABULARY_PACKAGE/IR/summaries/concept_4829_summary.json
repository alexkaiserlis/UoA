  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"trawler\" is redirected to \"fishing vessel,\" encompassing various types of seafo netters, including those operating in regions like the Cantabrian Sea. These vessels must be seaworthy and adhere to regulations regarding fishrooms and gutting processes to prevent undersized catches from imperiling fish stocks. The GFCM (General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean) oversees compliance, ensuring that fishing practices are rationalised and formatted to protect marine biodiversity. Vessels are equipped with safety devices such as EPIRB and VHF beacons, essential for navigation and emergency response, particularly in areas prone to tsunamis. Regulatory frameworks also address the remeasurement of vessels and the management of fishing quotas, which are crucial for sustainable practices.",
