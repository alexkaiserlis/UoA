  "summary": "The concept of \"fisheries structure\" pertains to the regulatory framework governing the organization and management of fisheries within the European Union. It encompasses the legal provisions that define the operational parameters for fishing activities, including fleet composition, fishing quotas, and sustainable practices. The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) aims to ensure the long-term viability of fish stocks while promoting economic stability in coastal communities. Effective fisheries structure is crucial for balancing ecological sustainability with socio-economic interests, thereby facilitating compliance with EU regulations and enhancing the overall governance of marine resources across member states.",
