  "summary": "Field research refers to the systematic investigation conducted in natural settings to gather empirical data, often essential for advancing knowledge in various domains, including social sciences and environmental studies. Within the EU legal and regulatory framework, field research plays a pivotal role in informing policy decisions and regulatory measures. It supports the development of evidence-based legislation and enhances the understanding of complex issues, such as biodiversity and public health. The outcomes of field research can influence intellectual property rights, particularly in the context of innovations derived from natural resources, thereby fostering sustainable development and compliance with EU directives.",
