  "summary": "The concept of \"peace movement,\" categorized under politics and public safety, is redirected to the preferred term \"pacifism.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, pacifism embodies the advocacy for non-violence and the resolution of conflicts through dialogue and diplomacy rather than military intervention. This principle aligns with the EU's foundational values of promoting peace, security, and human rights. Legal instruments and policies within the EU often reflect pacifist ideals, emphasizing conflict prevention and the importance of international cooperation. The peace movement, therefore, serves as a vital underpinning for EU initiatives aimed at fostering a stable and harmonious international environment.",
