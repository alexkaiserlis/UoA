  "summary": "The \"free-on-board price\" (FOB price) is a critical concept within EU transport policy, particularly relevant for the management of shipments involving hydrocarbons and refined products. This price designates the cost of goods at the port of departure, inclusive of all taxes and charges up to that point. Analyzing FOB prices helps identify anomalies and inconsistencies in market trends, facilitating the acquisition of petroleum and vegetable oils. Operators must communicate these prices transparently to ensure compliance with EU regulations. The advisability of using FOB pricing is often discussed in committees, as it impacts compensatory mechanisms and refunds related to international trade.",
