  "summary": "Cyclical unemployment refers to the fluctuations in employment levels that occur due to the economic cycle, characterized by periods of economic expansion and contraction. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, cyclical unemployment is significant as it influences labor market policies and social protection measures. The European Union monitors cyclical unemployment to implement targeted interventions, such as the European Social Fund, aimed at mitigating its effects. Understanding this concept is crucial for formulating effective employment strategies and ensuring compliance with EU directives that promote job creation and economic stability during downturns.",
