  "summary": "The concept of \"communautarism,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"communalism,\" pertains to a political framework within the European Union that emphasizes collective governance and community-oriented policies. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, communalism advocates for the integration of diverse cultural identities while fostering social cohesion. This approach aligns with the EU's objectives of promoting solidarity among member states and enhancing participatory democracy. By prioritizing communal interests, communalism seeks to balance individual rights with collective responsibilities, thereby reinforcing the foundational principles of the EU's legal architecture and its commitment to unity in diversity.",
