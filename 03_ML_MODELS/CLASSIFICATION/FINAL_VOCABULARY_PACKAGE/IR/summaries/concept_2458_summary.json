  "summary": "The concept of \"short-term economic policy\" within the EU legal framework is defined as a set of coordinated activities aimed at achieving specific economic objectives over a brief period. This policy often merges with other overlapping policies to ensure efficient budgetary management. The European Commission, in collaboration with the Council and Parliament, drafts decisions that take into account the necessary social and economic context. Established under the Treaty of Rome, these policies operate within a framework that avoids prejudicial duplication of responsibilities among committees. The existence of a single, coherent short-term economic policy is essential for the effective functioning of the European Communities.",
