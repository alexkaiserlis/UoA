  "summary": "The concept of \"reindeer\" within the EU regulatory framework pertains to the category of means of agricultural production. Reindeer husbandry is a traditional practice, particularly in northern regions, and is integral to the cultural heritage and economic sustainability of indigenous communities. The EU recognizes the importance of sustainable agricultural practices, including the management of reindeer populations, to ensure biodiversity and ecological balance. Regulatory measures may encompass animal welfare standards, environmental protection, and support for traditional farming methods. Thus, reindeer play a vital role in both agricultural production and the preservation of cultural identity within the EU's legal and regulatory landscape.",
