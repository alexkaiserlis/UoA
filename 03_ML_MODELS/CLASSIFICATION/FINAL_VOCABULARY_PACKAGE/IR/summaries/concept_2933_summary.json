  "summary": "Economic reconstruction refers to the process of revitalizing economies that have been stricken by crises, such as natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, it encompasses measures aimed at mobilising resources to sustain growth and facilitate infrastructural development. For instance, after the earthquake in Kocaeli, the EU's adherence to macrofinancial stability led to initiatives like PHARE and TACIS, which focused on optimising recovery efforts. The EU pursues a decentralised approach, allowing regions like Sakarya and Bolu to arrange their own recovery strategies. This includes fostering autonomy and ensuring that displaced populations can materialize their potential through targeted support and investment in key pillars of the economy.",
