  "summary": "The concept of \"post-industrial society,\" redirected to \"post-industrial economy,\" pertains to the transition from traditional industrial economies to those characterized by service-oriented sectors and knowledge-based industries. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this shift necessitates the adaptation of policies to support innovation, digital transformation, and sustainable economic practices. The post-industrial economy emphasizes the importance of intellectual capital and technological advancements, influencing regulations on labor markets, education, and environmental sustainability. Understanding this concept is crucial for formulating effective EU strategies that address the complexities of modern economic structures and promote equitable growth across member states.",
