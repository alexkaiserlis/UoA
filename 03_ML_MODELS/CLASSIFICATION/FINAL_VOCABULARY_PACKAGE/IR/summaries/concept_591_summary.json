  "summary": "The \"length of lease\" refers to the duration specified in a lease agreement, which is a critical aspect of construction and town planning regulations within the EU. This concept is essential for ensuring compliance with local housing policies, as it influences tenant rights, property management, and urban development strategies. In EU legal frameworks, the length of lease can affect the stability of housing markets and the sustainability of urban environments. Regulatory documents often stipulate minimum or maximum lease lengths to promote fair practices and protect both landlords and tenants, thereby facilitating balanced urban growth and community development.",
