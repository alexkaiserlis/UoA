  "summary": "Geographical mobility, within the context of EU migration law, refers to the ability of individuals to move across borders for various purposes, including employment, education, and residence. This concept is integral to the EU's commitment to fostering a single market, where free movement of persons enhances economic integration and social cohesion. Legal frameworks, such as the Schengen Agreement and the EU's Free Movement Directive, facilitate geographical mobility by establishing rights and obligations for migrants. These regulations aim to ensure that individuals can exercise their right to reside and work in different Member States, thereby promoting cultural exchange and labor market flexibility across the EU.",
