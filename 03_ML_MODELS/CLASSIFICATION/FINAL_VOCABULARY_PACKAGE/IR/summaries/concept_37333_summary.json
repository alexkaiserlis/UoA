  "summary": "The \"Continental Free Trade Area,\" specifically referred to as the \"African Continental Free Trade Area\" (AfCFTA), is a significant initiative aimed at enhancing intra-African trade and economic integration. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the AfCFTA serves as a model for regional trade agreements, emphasizing the importance of tariff reductions and the elimination of non-tariff barriers. The EU recognizes the potential of such agreements to foster sustainable development and economic cooperation. As a redirect, this concept highlights the EU's interest in promoting trade relations with extra-European organisations, particularly in Africa, to support mutual economic growth and stability.",
