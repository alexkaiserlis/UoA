  "summary": "Land reform refers to the legal and regulatory processes aimed at restructuring land ownership and usage within the EU's agricultural framework. This concept is pivotal in promoting equitable access to land, enhancing farming systems, and ensuring sustainable agricultural practices. EU policies on land reform often focus on redistributing land to improve productivity, support smallholder farmers, and address historical inequalities. These reforms are integral to achieving broader objectives such as rural development, environmental sustainability, and food security. By aligning land ownership with EU agricultural regulations, land reform plays a crucial role in fostering a resilient and competitive farming sector across member states.",
