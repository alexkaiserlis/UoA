  "summary": "Sustainable finance refers to financial activities that incorporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria into investment decisions, promoting long-term sustainable economic growth. Within the EU regulatory framework, sustainable finance aims to redirect capital flows towards sustainable projects and initiatives, thereby fostering a resilient economy. The European Commission has introduced various legislative measures, such as the EU Taxonomy Regulation, to establish a common classification system for sustainable activities. This regulatory approach not only enhances transparency but also mitigates greenwashing, ensuring that investments genuinely contribute to sustainability objectives. Sustainable finance is thus pivotal in achieving the EU's climate and sustainability goals.",
