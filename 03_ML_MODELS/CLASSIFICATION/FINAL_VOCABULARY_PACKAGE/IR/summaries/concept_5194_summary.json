  "summary": "The concept of \"free reception of broadcasts,\" redirected to the preferred term \"free movement of programmes,\" pertains to the legal framework governing the dissemination of audiovisual content across EU member states. This principle ensures that programmes can be transmitted and received without undue restrictions, promoting cultural diversity and consumer choice. The regulatory context emphasizes the importance of harmonizing national laws to facilitate the unobstructed flow of broadcasts, thereby enhancing the internal market. By safeguarding the free movement of programmes, the EU aims to foster a competitive environment for media services while respecting the rights of content creators and consumers alike.",
