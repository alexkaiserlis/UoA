  "summary": "A \"bilateral agreement\" refers to a formal arrangement between two sovereign entities, often utilized in international affairs to regulate various aspects such as trade, cooperation, and legal frameworks. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, these agreements can uplift trade relations and facilitate the transfrontier movement of goods and services. For instance, agreements with countries like Azerbaijan or Kyrgyzstan may include provisions on the reimportation of goods or the protection of trademarks under the TRIPS agreement. Such accords are crucial for professionals engaged in international trade, as they delineate the regularity of cargoes and outline the responsibilities of involved parties, including potential denunciation clauses. The EU often engages in conferences to ratify these agreements, ensuring that they align with broader regulatory frameworks.",
