  "summary": "A \"public library\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to a community institution that provides access to a diverse range of documentation and information resources. These libraries serve as vital nodes for promoting literacy, education, and cultural enrichment, aligning with EU objectives to foster knowledge dissemination and social inclusion. Public libraries are often supported by national and local legislation, which may outline their operational mandates, funding mechanisms, and collaborative frameworks with educational institutions. As repositories of information, they play a crucial role in ensuring equitable access to knowledge, thereby contributing to the overarching goals of the EU's digital and cultural policies.",
