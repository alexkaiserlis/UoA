  "summary": "Industrial research, as defined within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, embodies sophisticated methodologies aimed at advancing knowledge and innovation across various industries. This concept occupies a predominant role in the development of technologies, including thermonuclear and fission processes. The EU supports industrial research through cooperative initiatives that assign resources to academic and industrial chambers, fostering synergy between sectors. Achievements in this area contribute to rationalisation and the creation of superior products, such as advanced tyres and automotive components. By demonstrating fast cycles of innovation, industrial research aligns with EU goals for economic growth and sustainability, ensuring that industries can cope with evolving challenges.",
