  "summary": "The concept of \"national of the European Union,\" redirected to \"EU national,\" encompasses individuals who possess citizenship within an EU member state. This status confers various rights, including the ability to reside and work across member states, thus facilitating a liberalised movement of citizens. EU nationals are subject to specific legal frameworks that govern their electoral participation and candidacy in municipal elections. Additionally, they are protected against disqualification and deprivation of rights due to incapacity or illness. The enforceability of these rights is crucial, as it ensures that EU nationals can pursue redress against unlawful actions, such as counterfeiting or falsification of identity papers. Recognizable as citizens, EU nationals enjoy protections that extend to their spouses and dependents, thereby promoting a cohesive societal structure.",
