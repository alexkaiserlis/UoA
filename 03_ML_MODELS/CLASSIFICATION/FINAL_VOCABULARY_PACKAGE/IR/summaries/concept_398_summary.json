  "summary": "\"Extra-budgetary expenditure\" refers to financial allocations made outside the regular budgetary framework of the European Union. These expenditures are typically utilized for specific projects or initiatives that require funding beyond the approved budget, often in response to unforeseen circumstances or urgent needs. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, extra-budgetary expenditures must adhere to strict accountability and transparency standards, ensuring that they align with the overarching financial regulations governing EU operations. Such expenditures are subject to scrutiny to maintain fiscal discipline and uphold the integrity of the EU's financial management system.",
