  "summary": "The \"integration of migrants\" within the EU legal framework addresses the complex dynamics surrounding foreign nationals, including refugees and asylum seekers, who have been persecuted in their home countries. The EU emphasizes solidarity and strategic resettlement, proposing policies that facilitate the integration of migrants into host societies. This includes aligning educational curricula to accommodate diverse experiences and ensuring that migrants can access fundamental freedoms. The integration process aims to remove disparities and promote convergence among member states, while also addressing crime and enhancing border security. The EU's commitment to humanitarian principles is reiterated in various pacts, including the Geneva and Hague conventions, which guide resettlement efforts and support for migrants.",
