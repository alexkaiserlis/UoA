  "summary": "The concept of \"public building\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to structures primarily intended for use by the public, such as schools, hospitals, and government offices. These buildings are subject to specific construction and town planning regulations aimed at ensuring safety, accessibility, and environmental sustainability. The EU emphasizes compliance with directives that govern the design, construction, and operation of public buildings, promoting standards that enhance public welfare. Furthermore, public buildings often serve as focal points for community engagement and social services, reflecting the EU's commitment to fostering inclusive urban development and responsible governance in the construction sector.",
