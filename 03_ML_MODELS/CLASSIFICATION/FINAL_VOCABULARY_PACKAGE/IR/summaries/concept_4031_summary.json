  "summary": "The \"Protocol (EU)\" refers to formal agreements that alter or supplement existing treaties within the European Union framework. These protocols, often negotiated by plenipotentiaries, maintain specific privileges and immunities for EU institutions and their servants. They can address a range of issues, from reclassification of roles to exploratory sessions on emerging conflicts. For instance, protocols may include provisions for swaps in governance or settlements regarding disputes. By preserving the integrity of the EU legal order, these documents play a crucial role in the evolution of EU law, ensuring that member states can adapt to new challenges in an ever-changing era.",
