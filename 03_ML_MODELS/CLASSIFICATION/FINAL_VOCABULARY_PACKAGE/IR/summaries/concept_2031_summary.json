  "summary": "Nationalization, or \"nationalisation,\" refers to the process whereby a government takes ownership of private assets or enterprises, transforming them into state property. This legal mechanism is often employed in civil law jurisdictions within the EU to achieve public policy objectives, such as economic stability or social equity. Nationalization can occur through various regulatory frameworks and may involve compensation for affected parties, aligning with principles of fairness and justice. As a redirect term, \"nationalization\" leads to \"nationalisation,\" emphasizing the preferred spelling used in EU legal texts. This concept is crucial in understanding state intervention in the economy and its implications for property rights.",
