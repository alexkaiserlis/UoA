  "summary": "The concept of \"small industry\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to establishments that play a vital role in local economies, particularly in remote and coastal regions. These industries often face stringent constraints, including competition and health regulations, which can distort market dynamics. Small industries are crucial for the processing and distribution of local products, such as fishery outputs in areas like Greece. The EU aims to ensure that these industries meet minimum standards while avoiding excessive limits on production volume. By identifying and supporting small industries, the EU seeks to enhance their structural integrity and prevent the disappearance of vital local economies.",
