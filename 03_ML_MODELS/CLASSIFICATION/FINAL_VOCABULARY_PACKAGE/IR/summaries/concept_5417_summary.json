  "summary": "Public prosecution refers to the legal process by which a state-appointed prosecutor initiates and conducts criminal proceedings on behalf of the public interest. In the context of EU law, public prosecution plays a crucial role in ensuring the enforcement of laws and the protection of societal order. Prosecutors are tasked with investigating crimes, gathering evidence, and representing the state in court. This concept is integral to the justice system, as it upholds the rule of law and promotes accountability. The harmonization of public prosecution practices across EU member states is essential for effective cooperation in transnational criminal matters and the safeguarding of fundamental rights.",
