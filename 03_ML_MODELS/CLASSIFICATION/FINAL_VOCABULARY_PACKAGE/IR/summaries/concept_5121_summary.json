  "summary": "The concept of \"neo-colonialism\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"colonialism\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Neo-colonialism refers to the continued economic and political influence exerted by former colonial powers over developing nations, often through mechanisms such as trade agreements, investment policies, and international aid. This influence can perpetuate dependency and hinder sovereignty, raising concerns about equity and justice in international relations. The EU's regulatory approach seeks to address these issues by promoting fair trade practices and sustainable development, thereby fostering a more equitable global order that counters the remnants of colonialism.",
