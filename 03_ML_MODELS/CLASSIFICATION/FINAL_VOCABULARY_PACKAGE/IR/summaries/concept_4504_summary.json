  "summary": "The concept of \"voluntary termination of pregnancy,\" commonly referred to as \"abortion,\" pertains to the legal and regulatory frameworks within the EU that govern reproductive rights. This term encompasses the procedures and policies surrounding the choice to terminate a pregnancy, which varies significantly across member states. The EU does not have a unified legal stance on abortion; instead, it allows individual countries to legislate based on national values and public health considerations. This concept is essential for discussions on women's rights, healthcare access, and the intersection of legal norms and ethical considerations in reproductive health across the EU.",
