  "summary": "The principle of proportionality is a fundamental tenet in European Union law, ensuring that actions taken by EU institutions do not exceed what is necessary to achieve their objectives. This principle mandates a balance between the means employed and the desired ends, thereby safeguarding individual rights against excessive regulatory measures. It applies across various legal contexts, including legislative acts and judicial review, guiding the interpretation of EU regulations and directives. By adhering to this principle, the EU aims to promote fairness and prevent arbitrary or disproportionate interventions, thereby enhancing the legitimacy of its legal framework and fostering trust among member states and citizens.",
