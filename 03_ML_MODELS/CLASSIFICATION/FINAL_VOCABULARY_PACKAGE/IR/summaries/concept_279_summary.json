  "summary": "The concept of \"wage cost\" is pivotal in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly in accounting and economic policy. It encompasses the total expenses incurred by employers in compensating employees, including salaries and associated costs. Wage costs are influenced by various dynamics, such as inflationary pressures and the adaptability of labor markets, often analyzed through methodologies like ISCO and NACE classifications. The EU emphasizes comprehensible guidelines for member states to compile wage data, facilitating the comparison of benchmarks across sectors. This codification aids in understanding the segments of the unemployed and attracting intermediaries to enhance employment strategies, thereby lightening the burden on social systems.",
