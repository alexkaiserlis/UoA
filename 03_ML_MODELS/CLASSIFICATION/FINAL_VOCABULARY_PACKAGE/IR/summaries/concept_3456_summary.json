  "summary": "The concept of \"nuclear-free zone,\" redirected to the preferred term \"creation of nuclear-free zones,\" pertains to international security frameworks within EU legal and regulatory documents. Such zones are established to prohibit the development, deployment, and testing of nuclear weapons, thereby enhancing regional stability and promoting disarmament. The EU actively supports the establishment of these zones through diplomatic initiatives and treaties, aiming to mitigate the risks associated with nuclear proliferation. The legal implications of creating nuclear-free zones involve compliance with international law and the promotion of cooperative security measures among member states and neighboring regions, fostering a collective commitment to peace and security.",
