  "summary": "Incoterms, or International Commercial Terms, are a set of standardized trade terms established by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) to delineate the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in international transactions. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, Incoterms play a crucial role in clarifying obligations related to the delivery of goods, risk transfer, and cost allocation. The 2021 revision of these terms reflects evolving trade practices and aims to enhance legal certainty in cross-border trade. By providing a common language for international commerce, Incoterms facilitate compliance with EU regulations and support smooth trade operations within the single market.",
