  "summary": "The concept of \"criminal responsibility of minors\" within EU legal frameworks addresses the legal accountability of individuals under the age of majority for criminal acts. This area of criminal law recognizes that minors possess varying degrees of culpability, influenced by their developmental stage and understanding of right and wrong. EU member states have established diverse age thresholds and rehabilitation measures, reflecting a balance between accountability and the need for social reintegration. The European Union encourages harmonization of these laws to ensure protection of minors while promoting justice, emphasizing restorative approaches over punitive measures in juvenile justice systems.",
