  "summary": "\"Technological independence\" refers to the EU's strategic objective to reduce reliance on external technologies and enhance self-sufficiency in critical sectors. This concept is pivotal in international affairs, particularly in the context of regulatory frameworks that govern digital sovereignty, cybersecurity, and innovation.

Legal instruments and policies are being developed to promote research, development, and investment in domestic technologies, ensuring that the EU can assert its autonomy in an increasingly interconnected global landscape.
