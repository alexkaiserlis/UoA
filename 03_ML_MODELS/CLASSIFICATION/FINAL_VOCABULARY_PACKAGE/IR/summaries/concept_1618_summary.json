  "summary": "The \"right to associate,\" commonly referred to as \"freedom of association,\" is a fundamental principle enshrined in EU law, essential for the protection of human rights and democratic governance. This right is often cited in various agreements, such as the Cotonou Agreement, which emphasizes the need for governments to respect and implement democratic principles. Violated in certain contexts, the freedom of association allows representatives of civil society to engage in consultations with governments, ensuring that their voices are heard. The EU continues to extend this right through revised regulations and agreements, applying specific procedures to safeguard it, particularly in third countries like Zimbabwe. The rule of law must be upheld, with internal meetings and follow-ups specified in relevant paragraphs and annexes to ensure compliance and effective implementation.",
