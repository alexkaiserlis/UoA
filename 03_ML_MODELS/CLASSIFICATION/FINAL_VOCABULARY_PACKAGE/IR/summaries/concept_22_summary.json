  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"specialised committee\" refers to a body established to provide expert advice and facilitate decision-making within specific domains of EU policy. These committees play a crucial role in the legislative process, ensuring that specialized knowledge informs parliamentary discussions and decisions. The term \"specialised committee\" is preferred over \"specialized committee,\" reflecting the EU's commitment to linguistic precision. Such committees are instrumental in enhancing the efficiency of legislative procedures, enabling the European Parliament to address complex issues with the necessary expertise, thereby fostering informed governance and regulatory compliance across member states.",
