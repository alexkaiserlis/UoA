  "summary": "The concept of \"Nigeria\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to its classification as a beneficiary country under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP). This arrangement allows Nigeria to enjoy tariff preferences for its exports to the EU, thereby supporting its economic development. The EU's considerations for extending or lifting sanctions against Nigeria are influenced by its democratic governance and civilian leadership. The GSP scheme is subject to periodic reviews, and Nigeria's eligibility may expire or be suspended based on compliance with established thresholds. The aforementioned guidelines outline the conditions under which preferences are granted, ensuring that the government fulfills its obligations to maintain democratic values.",
