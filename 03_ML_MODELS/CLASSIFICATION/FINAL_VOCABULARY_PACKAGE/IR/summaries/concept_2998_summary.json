  "summary": "The concept of \"refusal to supply,\" also referred to as \"refusal to sell,\" pertains to competition law within the European Union. This legal principle arises when a dominant firm denies access to essential goods or services, potentially distorting market competition. Such conduct can be scrutinized under Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which prohibits abuse of a dominant position. The refusal may lead to significant regulatory implications, as it can hinder market entry for competitors and ultimately harm consumers. Thus, understanding this concept is crucial for assessing compliance with EU competition regulations.",
