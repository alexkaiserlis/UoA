  "summary": "The \"election programme\" is a critical component within the electoral procedure and voting framework of the European Union. It serves as a formal document outlining the policies, objectives, and commitments of political parties or candidates during electoral campaigns. The election programme is instrumental in informing voters about the candidates' positions on various issues, thereby facilitating informed decision-making. In the context of EU regulations, adherence to transparency and accountability standards in the formulation and dissemination of election programmes is paramount. This ensures that the electoral process is conducted fairly and that voters can engage meaningfully with the democratic process.",
