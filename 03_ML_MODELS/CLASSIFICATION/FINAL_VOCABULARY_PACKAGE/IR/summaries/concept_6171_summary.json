  "summary": "The concept of \"cloning\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to the replication of biological entities, particularly in the context of biotechnology and genetic engineering. Cloning raises significant ethical, legal, and technical considerations, prompting the EU to establish stringent regulations governing its practice. These regulations aim to ensure the safety and efficacy of cloned organisms, protect biodiversity, and address public concerns regarding genetic manipulation. The EU's approach includes directives and regulations that oversee research, commercial applications, and the implications of cloning technology, reflecting a commitment to responsible innovation while safeguarding human and environmental health.",
