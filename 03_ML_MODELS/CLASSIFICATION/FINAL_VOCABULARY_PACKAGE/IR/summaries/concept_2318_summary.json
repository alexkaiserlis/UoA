  "summary": "The concept of \"food shortage\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks addresses the unavailability of essential nutritional resources, which can lead to severe insecurity and poverty among populations. Over decades, successive reforms have aimed at stabilising food supply chains and ensuring coverage for deprived communities. The EU employs tools such as the Common Market Organisation (CMO) to cap price fluctuations and reimburse farmers facing sharp cutbacks. Additionally, funding mechanisms under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) contribute to phasing out disparities in food access. Parliaments undertake judgments that prioritize reliable food security, positively impacting cohesion and fulfilling broader socio-economic objectives.",
