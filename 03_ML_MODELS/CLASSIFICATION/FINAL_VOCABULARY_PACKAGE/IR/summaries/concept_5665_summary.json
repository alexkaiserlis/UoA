  "summary": "The concept of \"historical account\" within EU legal and regulatory documentation refers to a comprehensive narrative that chronicles the evolution of specific legal frameworks, policies, or regulations over time. This account is crucial for understanding the context and rationale behind legislative changes, providing insight into the socio-political factors that influenced their development. By documenting historical precedents, the EU ensures transparency and accountability in its decision-making processes. Such accounts are essential for legal practitioners and policymakers, as they facilitate informed interpretations and applications of existing laws, thereby enhancing the coherence and stability of the EU legal order.",
