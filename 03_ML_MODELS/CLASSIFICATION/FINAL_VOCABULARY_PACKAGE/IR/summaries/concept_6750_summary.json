  "summary": "An \"international merger\" refers to the consolidation of companies across national borders, which is subject to EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Such mergers are scrutinized under the EU Merger Regulation to ensure they do not significantly impede effective competition within the internal market. The assessment process involves evaluating market shares, potential anti-competitive effects, and the overall impact on consumers. Regulatory authorities, such as the European Commission, play a crucial role in approving or blocking these transactions to maintain market integrity and promote fair business practices. Compliance with these regulations is essential for companies pursuing cross-border mergers within the EU.",
