  "summary": "The concept of \"obligations of civil servants,\" redirected to \"duties of civil servants,\" encompasses the legal framework governing the conduct and responsibilities of public officials within the EU. Civil servants are expected to behave with integrity, ensuring openness and accountability in their actions. Misconduct, including allegations of corruption or irregularities, can lead to disciplinary proceedings. Their duties include safeguarding sensitive information, avoiding deviations from established protocols, and fulfilling assignments with autonomy. The framework also stipulates privileges and immunities, ensuring civil servants can perform their roles without undue influence. Investigations by bodies like OLAF may occur to address any misconduct or exploitation of their positions.",
