  "summary": "The term \"political club\" refers to an informal association of individuals united by shared political interests, often functioning similarly to a political party. Within the EU legal and regulatory framework, political clubs may influence policy-making and electoral processes, although they lack the formal recognition and structure of registered political parties. These entities can play a significant role in fostering political discourse and mobilizing support for various agendas. While not governed by the same stringent regulations as political parties, political clubs may still be subject to certain transparency and accountability standards, particularly in relation to funding and campaign activities.",
