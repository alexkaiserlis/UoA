  "summary": "The \"juvenile court\" is a specialized judicial body within the EU legal system, tasked with adjudicating cases involving minors. This court operates under distinct legal principles aimed at rehabilitation rather than punishment, reflecting the EU's commitment to the protection of children's rights as enshrined in various regulations and directives. Juvenile courts address offenses committed by individuals under the age of majority, ensuring that proceedings are conducted in a manner that respects the dignity and developmental needs of youth. The establishment and functioning of juvenile courts are influenced by EU legislation, promoting uniformity in the treatment of juvenile offenders across member states.",
