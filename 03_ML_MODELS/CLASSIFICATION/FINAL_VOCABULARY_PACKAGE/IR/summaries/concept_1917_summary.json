  "summary": "Interurban migration refers to the movement of individuals between urban areas within a country, often influenced by socio-economic factors such as employment opportunities, housing availability, and quality of life. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, interurban migration can impact regional development policies and urban planning initiatives. The European Union recognizes the significance of interurban migration in addressing demographic challenges and promoting sustainable urban environments. Regulatory measures may be implemented to facilitate integration and support local authorities in managing the effects of such migration, ensuring balanced regional growth and the effective allocation of resources across urban centers.",
