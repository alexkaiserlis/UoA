  "summary": "Industrial pollution, a critical concern within the EU's regulatory framework, encompasses various emissions and waste generated by sectors such as foundries and energy production. The Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) mandates stringent methods for monitoring pollutants, including hexachloroethane and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Facilities like the Aberthaw power station must implement best available techniques (BAT) for desulphurisation and firing processes to minimize environmental impact. The recalculations of emissions data are essential for compliance, while the use of reactive diluents in refining processes poses challenges. As industries evolve, addressing obsolescence in technology and practices remains vital for achieving sustainable megawatt outputs and reducing environmental deterioration.",
