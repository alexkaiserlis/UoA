  "summary": "The concept of \"strategic defence\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to the comprehensive approach adopted by the European Union to enhance collective security and military capabilities. It encompasses policies and initiatives aimed at fostering cooperation among member states in defence planning, procurement, and operational readiness. Strategic defence is crucial for addressing emerging security threats and ensuring the EU's geopolitical stability. It also involves the alignment of national defence strategies with EU objectives, thereby reinforcing the Union's role in global security governance. This concept is integral to the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and reflects a commitment to collaborative defence efforts.",
