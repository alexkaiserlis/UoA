  "summary": "Sociocultural anthropology, redirected to the preferred term \"social and cultural anthropology,\" encompasses the study of human societies and cultural practices, emphasizing the intricate relationships between social structures and cultural expressions. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this discipline informs policy-making by providing insights into cultural diversity, social cohesion, and the implications of migration. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing inclusive legislation that respects cultural heritage while promoting social integration. By integrating findings from social and cultural anthropology, EU institutions can enhance their regulatory approaches, ensuring they are responsive to the sociocultural realities of member states.",
