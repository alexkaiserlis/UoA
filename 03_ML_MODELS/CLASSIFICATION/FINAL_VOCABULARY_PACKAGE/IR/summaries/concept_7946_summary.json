  "summary": "The \"care allowance\" is a financial benefit provided under the framework of social protection within the European Union. It aims to support individuals who provide care for dependents, such as children or elderly family members, thereby facilitating their ability to balance caregiving responsibilities with employment. This allowance is part of broader EU initiatives to enhance social welfare systems and promote equality in the labor market. By providing financial assistance, the care allowance helps mitigate the economic impact of caregiving, ensuring that caregivers are not disproportionately disadvantaged. Its implementation varies across Member States, reflecting diverse national policies on social protection.",
