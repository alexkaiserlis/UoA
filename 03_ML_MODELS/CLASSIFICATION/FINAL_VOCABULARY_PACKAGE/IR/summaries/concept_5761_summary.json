  "summary": "The \"Trevi Group\" refers to an informal EU body established to enhance police and judicial cooperation among member states. This group was pivotal in fostering collaboration on transnational crime and security issues, laying the groundwork for subsequent formal frameworks. As a redirect to the preferred term \"EU body for police and judicial cooperation,\" the Trevi Group's legacy is evident in the evolution of EU legal instruments aimed at harmonizing law enforcement practices. Its discussions and initiatives contributed significantly to the development of policies that prioritize mutual recognition and operational synergy in the realm of justice and home affairs within the EU.",
