  "summary": "The term \"falsified medicine\" refers to pharmaceutical products that are deliberately misrepresented in terms of their identity, composition, or source. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the falsification of medicines poses significant public health risks and undermines the integrity of healthcare systems. The EU has implemented stringent regulations, such as the Falsified Medicines Directive (2011/62/EU), to combat this issue by establishing robust measures for the verification and traceability of medicinal products. These regulations aim to ensure that only safe and effective medicines reach patients, thereby safeguarding public health and maintaining trust in the pharmaceutical supply chain.",
