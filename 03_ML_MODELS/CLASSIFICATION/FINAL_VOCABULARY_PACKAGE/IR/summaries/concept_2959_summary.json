  "summary": "Rediscounting refers to the process by which financial institutions, particularly central banks, provide liquidity to commercial banks by purchasing their short-term securities or promissory notes at a discount. This mechanism is crucial in the context of monetary policy, as it allows banks to manage their liquidity needs and maintain stability in the financial system. In the EU regulatory framework, rediscounting plays a significant role in the operations of the European Central Bank (ECB) and national central banks, facilitating the transmission of monetary policy and ensuring that credit flows to the economy efficiently.",
