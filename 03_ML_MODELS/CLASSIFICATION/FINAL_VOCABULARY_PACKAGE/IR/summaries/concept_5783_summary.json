  "summary": "The term \"civilian personnel\" refers to non-military staff employed within defense contexts, particularly in the European Union's regulatory framework. This category encompasses individuals engaged in support roles that facilitate military operations, peacekeeping missions, and humanitarian efforts. Civilian personnel are integral to the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), ensuring operational effectiveness while adhering to legal and ethical standards. Their deployment is governed by specific regulations that outline recruitment, training, and operational protocols, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a clear distinction between military and civilian roles in defense initiatives. This distinction is crucial for compliance with international law and EU policies.",
