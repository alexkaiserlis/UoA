  "summary": "Non-formal education refers to structured learning activities that occur outside the formal education system, such as schools and universities, yet are intentionally designed to facilitate learning. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, non-formal education plays a crucial role in promoting lifelong learning, enhancing employability, and fostering social inclusion. It encompasses various initiatives, including vocational training, community education programs, and workshops, which are often supported by EU funding mechanisms. By recognizing the value of non-formal education, the EU aims to create a more adaptable and skilled workforce, aligning educational outcomes with the dynamic needs of the labor market.",
