  "summary": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of synthetic chemicals characterized by their carbon-fluorine bonds, which confer unique properties such as resistance to heat, water, and oil. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, PFAS are subject to scrutiny due to their persistence in the environment and potential health risks. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) plays a pivotal role in assessing these substances under the REACH Regulation, aiming to mitigate their impact on human health and ecosystems. Regulatory measures may include restrictions, bans, and monitoring to ensure compliance with safety standards across member states.",
