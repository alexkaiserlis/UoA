  "summary": "The \"spot market\" refers to a marketplace where financial instruments, commodities, or currencies are traded for immediate delivery and payment. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the spot market plays a crucial role in facilitating the free movement of capital, as it allows for the swift exchange of assets without the delays associated with future contracts. Regulatory bodies, such as the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), oversee these transactions to ensure transparency and mitigate risks. The effective functioning of the spot market is essential for maintaining liquidity and stability within the EU's financial system, thereby supporting economic integration.",
