  "summary": "The \"backlog of court cases\" refers to the accumulation of unresolved legal matters within judicial systems, which can impede the timely administration of justice. In the context of EU law, this backlog poses significant challenges, as it affects the efficiency and effectiveness of courts across member states. The European Union has recognized the necessity of addressing this issue to uphold the rule of law and ensure access to justice for all citizens. Initiatives aimed at reducing the backlog often involve procedural reforms, enhanced resource allocation, and the promotion of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, thereby fostering a more responsive legal framework.",
