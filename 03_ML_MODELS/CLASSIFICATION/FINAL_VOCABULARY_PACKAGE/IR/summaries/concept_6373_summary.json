  "summary": "The \"Union for the Mediterranean\" represents a significant framework for cooperation among EU member states and Mediterranean partners, including countries like Tunisia and Israel. This initiative entails a series of protocols and meetings aimed at liberalisation and sectoral negotiations, fostering reciprocal commitments. The EU's legal instruments allow for the exercise of policies that promote greater participation in areas such as fishery and economic adjustments. Through enabling acts and letters of consent, the Union has successfully pursued negotiations that facilitate the signing of agreements. The completion of these negotiations is crucial for the integration of Bulgaria and Romania into broader Mediterranean policies, ensuring that all parties can participate effectively.",
