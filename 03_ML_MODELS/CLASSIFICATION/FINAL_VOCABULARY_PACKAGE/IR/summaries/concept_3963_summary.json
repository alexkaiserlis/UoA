  "summary": "Prison administration refers to the regulatory framework governing the management and operation of correctional facilities within the European Union. It encompasses various aspects of criminal law, including the treatment of inmates, rehabilitation programs, and the enforcement of human rights standards. The EU promotes harmonization of prison administration practices to ensure compliance with international conventions and directives, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of penal systems across member states. This concept is critical for fostering a rehabilitative environment, reducing recidivism, and ensuring that prison conditions meet established legal and ethical standards. Effective prison administration is essential for upholding the rule of law and protecting societal interests.",
