  "summary": "The concept of \"modernisation of farming,\" redirected to the preferred term \"farm modernisation,\" encompasses various aspects of agricultural development within the EU regulatory framework. This initiative aims to liberate farmers from underdevelopment through effective financial support mechanisms, such as structural premiums and grants. It promotes the electrification and rationalization of agricultural practices, integrating modern technologies into farming classrooms. Institutions in agriculture and horticulture are encouraged to engage in amalgamations and collaborations, fostering a community of helpers and labourers. The EU's proclamations on farm modernisation forward the goal of sustainable agriculture, determining the future of rural landscapes while addressing the smallness of certain operations and enhancing management accounts.",
