  "summary": "A credit union is a member-owned financial institution that provides a range of financial services, including savings accounts, loans, and other banking products. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, credit unions operate under specific directives that promote cooperative principles and member participation. They are subject to regulations ensuring financial stability, consumer protection, and adherence to prudential standards. The European Union recognizes credit unions as vital components of the financial ecosystem, fostering financial inclusion and community development. Their operations are guided by principles of mutuality, emphasizing the importance of member benefit over profit maximization.",
