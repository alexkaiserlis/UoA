  "summary": "The concept of \"essential oil\" falls under the category of processed agricultural produce within EU legal frameworks. These oils, derived from various plants, such as българско розово масло (Bulgarian rose oil) and orange oil, are subject to stringent regulations regarding their production and marketing. The incorporation of essential oils into products must satisfy specific designations, such as PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) and PGI (Protected Geographical Indication). Holders of these designations must prepare comprehensive dossiers for authorisations, demonstrating compliance with pesticide regulations and other specifications. The rapporteur's role includes interpreting these regulations and ensuring completeness during examinations, while minor variations may arise in the approval process. Thus, essential oils exemplify the intersection of agriculture and regulatory compliance in the EU.",
