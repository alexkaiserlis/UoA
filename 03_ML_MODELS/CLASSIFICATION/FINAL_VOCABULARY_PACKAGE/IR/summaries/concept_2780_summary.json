  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"semi-manufactured goods\" constitute a significant category of products that are partly processed but not yet finished. These goods are often involved in negotiations under multilateral frameworks such as GATT, where concessions and preferences may be invoked to facilitate trade. The elimination of tariffs on these goods can lead to reductions in charges, benefiting participating nations. Regularizations may apply to ensure compliance with standards, while ceilings on imports can be established to manage supply. The series of regulations governing semi-manufactured goods often includes provisions for autonomous adjustments, reflecting the EU's commitment to maintaining a balanced trade calendar and supporting its member states.",
