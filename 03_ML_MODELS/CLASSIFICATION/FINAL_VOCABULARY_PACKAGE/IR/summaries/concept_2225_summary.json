  "summary": "The concept of \"basket of currencies\" refers to a collection of different currencies used to determine the value of a financial instrument or to stabilize exchange rates within the context of monetary relations in the European Union. This mechanism can mitigate volatility and enhance predictability in international trade and investment. In EU regulatory frameworks, a basket of currencies may be employed to assess the performance of the euro against other currencies, thereby influencing monetary policy decisions. Such instruments are integral to maintaining economic stability and fostering cooperation among member states in the realm of financial governance.",
