  "summary": "A \"regional development bank\" is a financial institution primarily focused on fostering economic growth in underdeveloped or poorer regions within the EU. This concept redirects to the preferred term \"development bank,\" which embodies the principles of equity and solidarity among member states. Such banks often engage in crossborder initiatives, empowering populations through sustainable infrastructures and disbursed funds. They may also collaborate with affiliated entities like the EIF to reinforce financial solvency. Development banks are instrumental in enumerating projects that support the poorest communities, furthering economic stability and fostering alliances among donors. Their statutes often include provisions for Islamic financing, reflecting a diverse approach to financial inclusion.",
