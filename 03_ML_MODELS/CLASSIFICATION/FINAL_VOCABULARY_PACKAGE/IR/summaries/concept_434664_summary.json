  "summary": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a pivotal entity established under the auspices of the United Nations, tasked with assessing scientific knowledge related to climate change. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the IPCC's findings inform critical policy-making processes aimed at achieving the EU's climate goals, such as the European Green Deal. The IPCC's comprehensive reports serve as a foundation for legislative measures, guiding member states in their commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance climate resilience. Consequently, the IPCC plays a crucial role in shaping EU environmental law and international climate agreements.",
