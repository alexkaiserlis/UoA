  "summary": "The term \"endemic disease\" refers to a health condition that is consistently present within a particular geographic area or population. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, endemic diseases are significant for public health policies and surveillance systems. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) monitors such diseases to inform risk assessments and health interventions. Regulatory measures may include vaccination programs, health education, and resource allocation to mitigate the impact of endemic diseases. Understanding the prevalence and management of these conditions is crucial for ensuring the health security of EU member states and enhancing overall public health resilience.",
