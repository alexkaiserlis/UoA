  "summary": "The concept of \"encyclopaedia\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory documents refers to a comprehensive compilation of knowledge that serves as a reference for legal practitioners, policymakers, and scholars. It encompasses a wide array of topics, including legislation, case law, and regulatory frameworks pertinent to the European Union. An encyclopaedia aids in the elucidation of complex legal principles and facilitates informed decision-making by providing accessible information. In the realm of EU documentation, such resources are invaluable for ensuring consistency in legal interpretation and enhancing the transparency of regulatory processes, thereby promoting a well-informed public discourse on EU matters.",
