  "summary": "\"Climate security\" refers to the intersection of environmental sustainability and international security within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. It encompasses the recognition that climate change poses significant threats to global stability, necessitating proactive measures to mitigate risks associated with resource scarcity, migration, and geopolitical tensions. The EU addresses climate security through various legal instruments, including the European Green Deal and the Paris Agreement, which aim to enhance resilience against climate-related challenges. By integrating climate considerations into security policies, the EU seeks to foster a comprehensive approach that safeguards both environmental integrity and international peace, thereby reinforcing its commitment to sustainable development.",
