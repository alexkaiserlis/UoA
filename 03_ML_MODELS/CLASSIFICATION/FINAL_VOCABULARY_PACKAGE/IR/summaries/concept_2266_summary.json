  "summary": "Workplace democracy, often referred to as \"worker participation,\" constitutes a fundamental aspect of labour law and relations within the EU. It emphasizes the realization of workers' rights through their involvement in decision-making processes related to working conditions, safety, and organizational improvements. EU directives encourage the creation of frameworks that ensure workers are consulted and informed about significant changes, especially concerning machinery and installations. By imposing standards for communication and advisory roles, these regulations aim to foster a better working environment. The intention is to guarantee that workers are not only informed but also actively engaged in drafting proposals that affect their medium and long-term interests.",
