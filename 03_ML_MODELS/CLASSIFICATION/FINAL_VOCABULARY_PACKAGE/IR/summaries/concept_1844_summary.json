  "summary": "The term \"CACM countries\" refers to the member states involved in the Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management (CACM) framework within the European Union. This regulatory concept is crucial for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of electricity markets across borders. CACM countries collaborate to establish harmonized rules for capacity allocation and congestion management, facilitating cross-border electricity trading. The legal framework aims to promote competition, ensure security of supply, and optimize resource allocation, thereby contributing to the EU's broader energy policy objectives. Understanding the dynamics of CACM countries is essential for stakeholders engaged in energy regulation and market operations within the EU context.",
