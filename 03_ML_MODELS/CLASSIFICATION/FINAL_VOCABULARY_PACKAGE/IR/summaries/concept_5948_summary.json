  "summary": "The \"European Political Union\" refers to the advanced integration of EU member states, embodying a collective governance framework that transcends mere economic cooperation. This concept encompasses the establishment of shared political institutions, a common foreign policy, and enhanced democratic legitimacy within the EU structure. It aims to foster solidarity and coherence among member states, facilitating joint decision-making processes that address transnational challenges. The legal foundation for the European Political Union is rooted in various treaties, which delineate the regulatory mechanisms necessary for achieving a unified political entity. This concept is pivotal for understanding the evolution of EU governance and its implications for member state sovereignty.",
