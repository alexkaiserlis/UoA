  "summary": "The concept of \"university training,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"university,\" encompasses the role of universities in fostering societal innovation and addressing challenges through education and research. In the EU context, universities are pivotal entities that leverage partnerships to fulfill educational goals and tackle emerging issues. They facilitate optimal programming and dissemination of knowledge, enriching the skill sets of participants. The involvement of stakeholders, including researchers and funding bodies, is crucial for addressing fragmentation in higher education. Through initiatives like Horizon and COMETT, universities in member states, including Iceland and Switzerland, are encouraged to negotiate collaborations that enhance their global competitiveness and contribute to a confederation of knowledge.",
