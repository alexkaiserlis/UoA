  "summary": "The term \"constitution\" refers to the foundational legal document that outlines the fundamental principles and established precedents governing a state or organization. In the context of the European Union, the concept of a constitution is pivotal, as it encompasses the treaties and legal frameworks that define the EU's institutional structure, powers, and the rights of its citizens. While the EU does not possess a single constitution akin to member states, the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union serve constitutional functions, establishing the legal order and guiding the regulatory landscape within which EU law operates.",
