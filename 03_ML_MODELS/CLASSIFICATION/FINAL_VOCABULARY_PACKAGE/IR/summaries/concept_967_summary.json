  "summary": "The concept of \"family by marriage\" pertains to the legal recognition of familial relationships established through matrimony within EU legal frameworks. This concept is crucial in various regulatory contexts, including immigration law, social security, and family law, where the rights and obligations of individuals in a marital union are defined. In the EU, \"family by marriage\" may influence the determination of residency rights, access to benefits, and the application of cross-border legal principles. The recognition of such familial ties is essential for ensuring the protection of individual rights and promoting social cohesion across member states.",
