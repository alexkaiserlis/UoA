  "summary": "Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a critical methodology in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly within the context of accounting and economic assessment. It involves calculating the optimal balance of costs and benefits associated with proposed policies or projects, such as those related to JHA (Justice and Home Affairs) initiatives. CBA seeks to prevent errors in decision-making by providing a comparative evaluation of merits, thereby ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently. This analysis is essential for judicial and police cooperation, as seen in databases like Eurodac and Europol. Ultimately, CBA aids in rejoining partners in enforcement efforts, facilitating the cessation of criminal offences and enhancing overall significance in EU governance.",
