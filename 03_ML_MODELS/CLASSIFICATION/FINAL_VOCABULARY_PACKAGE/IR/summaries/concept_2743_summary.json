  "summary": "In EU regulatory frameworks, a \"frozen product\" refers to foodstuff that has undergone supercooling to preserve its consistence and quality. This includes various items such as poultrymeat and seafood, including species like theragra and japonicus. The administration of frozen products is governed by specific tariff regulations to ensure that they are not overdeclared or underdeclared in trade. Ingredients like alginic acid, gellan, and carrageenan may be used as stabilizers in these products. The legal demarcations surrounding frozen products necessitate rigorous monitoring to prevent hypercholesterolaemic effects and ensure consumer safety. Agreements on labeling and storage practices are critical for compliance.",
