  "summary": "Technical ceramics encompass a range of materials classified for their unique properties, including vitrified, opaque, and vitreous characteristics. These ceramics, such as porcelain and china, are assessed based on their density, porosity, and translucency. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, technical ceramics are subject to specific methods of analysis and classification, which prescribe standards for quality and performance. The nomenclature used in customs tariffs and regulations uniformly categorizes these materials, ensuring that products exceeding certain thresholds are appropriately classified. The desirable qualities of these ceramics, often coloured or coated, are crucial for their applications in various industries.",
