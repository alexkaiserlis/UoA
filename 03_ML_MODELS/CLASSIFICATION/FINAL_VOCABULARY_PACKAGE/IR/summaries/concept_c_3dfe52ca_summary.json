  "summary": "Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, refers to algorithms that enable systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time without explicit programming. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, machine learning is increasingly relevant for data processing, enhancing decision-making in areas such as competition law, data protection, and public administration. The EU is actively exploring the implications of machine learning technologies, particularly regarding compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and ethical considerations surrounding automated decision-making. As machine learning evolves, its regulatory oversight will be crucial to ensure transparency and accountability in its applications.",
