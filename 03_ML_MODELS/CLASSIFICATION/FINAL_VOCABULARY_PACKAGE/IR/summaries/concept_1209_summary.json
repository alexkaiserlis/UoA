  "summary": "Gelderland, a region in the Netherlands, plays a significant role in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning regional development and cohesion. Notably, cities like Nijmegen and Arnhem are central to initiatives aimed at addressing redundancies and fostering reintegration within the labor market. The European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) mobilise resources to support projects in Gelderland, promoting additionality and readiness for globalisation challenges. Programming frameworks, including NACE classifications, are employed to satisfy statutory requirements and facilitate lending through instruments like the EIB. The region's development patterns are closely monitored, ensuring effective indexation and responsiveness to economic changes.",
