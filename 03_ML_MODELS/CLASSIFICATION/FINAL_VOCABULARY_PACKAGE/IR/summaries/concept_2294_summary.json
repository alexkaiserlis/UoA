  "summary": "In the context of EU cooperation policy, a \"donor country\" refers to a nation that provides financial assistance, resources, or expertise to support development initiatives in recipient countries. This concept is integral to the EU's external action framework, which aims to foster sustainable development and enhance global partnerships. Donor countries play a crucial role in international cooperation, facilitating the transfer of knowledge and technology while promoting economic stability. The EU's regulatory documents often outline the obligations and expectations of donor countries, ensuring that aid is effectively allocated and aligned with broader strategic objectives in international relations and humanitarian efforts.",
