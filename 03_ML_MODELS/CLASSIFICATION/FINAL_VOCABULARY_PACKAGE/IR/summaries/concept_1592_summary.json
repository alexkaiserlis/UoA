  "summary": "Anti-trust legislation within the European Union encompasses a set of legal frameworks designed to promote competition and prevent monopolistic practices. This regulatory framework aims to safeguard consumer interests by prohibiting agreements that restrict competition, such as cartels and abuse of dominant market positions. The enforcement of anti-trust laws is primarily overseen by the European Commission, which investigates potential violations and imposes sanctions. These measures are crucial for maintaining a competitive market environment, fostering innovation, and ensuring fair pricing. Overall, anti-trust legislation serves as a cornerstone of EU competition policy, promoting economic efficiency and consumer welfare across member states.",
