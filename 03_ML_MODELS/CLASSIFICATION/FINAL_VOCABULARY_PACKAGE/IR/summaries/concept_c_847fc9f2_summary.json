  "summary": "Interreligious dialogue refers to the structured engagement and communication between different religious communities, fostering mutual understanding and respect. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, interreligious dialogue is essential for promoting cultural diversity and social cohesion. The EU recognizes the importance of this dialogue in addressing issues related to discrimination and intolerance, thereby enhancing the protection of fundamental rights. Initiatives such as the European Commission's support for intercultural dialogue underscore the EU's commitment to creating an inclusive society where diverse religious beliefs coexist harmoniously. This concept is pivotal in shaping policies that uphold democratic values and cultural pluralism within the Union.",
