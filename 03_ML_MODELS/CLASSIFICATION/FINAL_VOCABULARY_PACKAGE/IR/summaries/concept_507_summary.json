  "summary": "The concept of \"village,\" categorized under construction and town planning, is redirected to the preferred term \"rural settlement\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. This term encompasses small, often agrarian communities that play a vital role in regional development and land use planning. In EU legislation, rural settlements are significant for implementing policies related to sustainable development, environmental protection, and rural cohesion. The regulatory approach to rural settlements includes considerations for infrastructure development, preservation of cultural heritage, and promotion of local economies. Understanding this concept is essential for effective governance and compliance with EU directives on spatial planning and rural development.",
