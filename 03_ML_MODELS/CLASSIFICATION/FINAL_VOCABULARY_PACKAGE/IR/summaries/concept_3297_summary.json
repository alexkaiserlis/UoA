  "summary": "The concept of \"theology\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory documents pertains to the study of religious beliefs and their implications for culture and society. While not a direct focus of EU legislation, theology intersects with various legal frameworks, particularly in areas concerning freedom of religion, cultural heritage, and human rights. The EU recognizes the importance of religious diversity and the role of theology in fostering intercultural dialogue. This understanding informs policies that promote tolerance and respect for different faiths, ensuring that theological perspectives are considered in discussions about cultural identity and social cohesion across member states.",
