  "summary": "The \"power to appoint\" within the EU political framework refers to the authority exercised by various institutions, such as councils and secretariats, to select officials and personnel, including the ombudsman and deputy auditors. This power is crucial for ensuring that appointments are made based on professional qualifications and enhanced screening processes. The process invites candidates to submit their titles and career achievements, while also adhering to regulations that restrict certain appointments. The Amsterdam Treaty, for instance, established clearer protocols for these appointments, ensuring that the foundation of EU institutions remains robust and effective. Ultimately, the power to appoint is vital for maintaining the integrity and functionality of EU governance.",
