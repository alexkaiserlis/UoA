  "summary": "The \"greenhouse effect\" emphasizes the anthropogenic impact on climate change, a theme outlined in various EU legal frameworks. Acknowledging the need for stabilizing atmospheric conditions, the EU has undertaken strategies to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The Montreal Protocol and subsequent agreements reaffirmed the commitment of signatories to compile inventories of emissions, stressing the importance of equitable solutions. Over the past decade, EU ministers have reviewed methodologies for measuring and reporting emissions, urging member states to concentrate efforts on reaching targets. The perspective of joint action is crucial for effectively addressing pollution and ensuring a sustainable future for all, willing to share responsibilities.",
