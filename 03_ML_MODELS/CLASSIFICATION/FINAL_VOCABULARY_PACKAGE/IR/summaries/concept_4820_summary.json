  "summary": "The concept of \"low pay\" pertains to the remuneration of personnel within the EU framework, particularly in the context of personnel management and staff remuneration. It encompasses the legal and regulatory considerations surrounding minimum wage standards, equitable compensation, and the implications of wage disparities on social justice and economic stability. The EU has established directives aimed at addressing low pay, promoting fair remuneration practices, and ensuring that all workers receive a living wage. This concept is integral to discussions on labor rights, economic policy, and the overall welfare of the workforce, reflecting the EU's commitment to social cohesion and equitable growth.",
