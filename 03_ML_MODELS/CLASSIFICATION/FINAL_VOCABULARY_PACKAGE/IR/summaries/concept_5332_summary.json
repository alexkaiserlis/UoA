  "summary": "An \"anti-dumping measure\" in EU law is a regulatory tool designed to counteract the undesirably low pricing of imported goods that disrupts fair competition. Such measures are essential to protect EU industries, particularly metallurgical sectors, from the impudence of foreign producers, such as those from Haldia or Taganrog, who may engage in dumping practices. The EU employs these measures through investigations, often involving complex data analysis, including micrometers and ferrochrome imports from regions like Guangxi and Chengdu. By imposing tariffs, the EU aims for market revitalization, ensuring that local manufacturers, such as those in Lahr and Irkutsk, can compete effectively against unfair pricing strategies.",
