  "summary": "A \"complementarity agreement\" within the EU legal framework refers to a formal arrangement that fosters cooperation among member states or between EU institutions and external entities. This type of agreement is essential in ensuring that various policies and regulatory measures are harmonized, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of cooperation policy. By establishing clear roles and responsibilities, complementarity agreements aim to prevent overlaps and gaps in regulatory efforts, thus promoting efficient resource allocation. Such agreements are crucial for achieving common objectives while respecting the sovereignty of member states, ultimately contributing to the cohesion and integration of the European Union.",
