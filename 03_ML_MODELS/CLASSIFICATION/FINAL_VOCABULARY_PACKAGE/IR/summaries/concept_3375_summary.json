  "summary": "The concept of \"private medical treatment\" encompasses healthcare services provided outside the public health system, often funded directly by patients or through private insurance. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, private medical treatment is subject to various directives and regulations that aim to ensure patient rights, quality of care, and cross-border healthcare access. The EU promotes the principle of free movement of services, allowing patients to seek private medical treatment in different member states. This concept is pivotal in discussions regarding healthcare financing, patient autonomy, and the regulation of private healthcare providers within the EU.",
