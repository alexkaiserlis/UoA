  "summary": "Peat, classified under the EU energy policy framework, refers to a significant substance formed from the accumulation of partially rotted organic material, including turf and leaf litter. It is often agglomerated with other materials like marl and sand, and its use in agriculture involves mixtures with fertilizers containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. The regulatory context includes the assessment of peat as a commodity, where its character and weight are critical for compliance with harmonized tariffs and external trade regulations. The nomenclature surrounding peat also involves coding and descriptions that facilitate the transposition of legal standards, ensuring that all substances meet the required specifications and are regarded appropriately in EU statistics.",
