  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"consumption\" pertains to the quantity of goods and services utilized by individuals and entities, influencing economic measures such as GNPMP. It encompasses various products, including food items like bananas and dairy products, which may undergo processes such as denaturing or repacking. Regulatory stipulations often address issues of quality, ensuring that products remain unaltered and legible in labeling. Additionally, promotional measures may involve vouchers or features that enhance consumer engagement. The concept also intersects with tariffs and the potential for misuse, necessitating ongoing enquiries to solve regulatory challenges and uphold standards in consumption practices.",
