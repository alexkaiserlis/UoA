  "summary": "The concept of \"representative action,\" also known as \"collective redress,\" plays a crucial role in EU legal frameworks aimed at enhancing access to justice. It allows individuals or groups to seek redress collectively for violations of rights, particularly in consumer protection and environmental matters. This mechanism enables a single representative to file a lawsuit on behalf of multiple claimants, streamlining the judicial process and reducing the burden on courts. By facilitating collective action, the EU aims to ensure effective enforcement of rights and promote a more equitable legal landscape, thereby reinforcing the principle of justice within its member states.",
