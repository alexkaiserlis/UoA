  "summary": "Sierra Leone, categorized under economic geography, is pertinent in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning fisheries management. The countryâ€™s waters are home to various species, including thunnus and xiphias, which are often fished using longline techniques. However, unregulated fishing practices have diminished fish stocks, including bigeye and swordfish, raising concerns about sustainability. The European Union, through ICCAT, seeks to address these issues by penalising breaches of fishing quotas and promoting responsible practices among tenderers and fishermen. Additionally, Sierra Leone's sovereignty over its marine resources must be respected to prevent unreported and illegal activities that jeopardize its economic stability.",
