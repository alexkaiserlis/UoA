It encompasses zones where infrastructure, residential, and commercial buildings are concentrated, impacting town planning and environmental assessments. In the context of EU legislation, built-up areas are critical for implementing sustainable urban development policies, land-use regulations, and assessing the implications of construction activities on local ecosystems. Understanding built-up areas is essential for compliance with EU directives aimed at promoting efficient land management and enhancing urban resilience against climate change.",
