  "summary": "Short-term credit refers to financial arrangements that provide borrowers with immediate access to funds for a limited duration, typically less than one year. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, short-term credit is governed by various directives aimed at ensuring consumer protection and promoting transparency within financial institutions. Regulations such as the Consumer Credit Directive establish standards for the provision of short-term credit, mandating clear disclosure of terms and conditions. This concept is crucial for facilitating liquidity and supporting economic activity, while also addressing potential risks associated with high-interest rates and over-indebtedness among consumers.",
