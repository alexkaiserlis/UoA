  "summary": "The term \"war criminal\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"war crime,\" which encompasses serious violations of international humanitarian law. Within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the prosecution of war criminals, such as indictees like Ratko Mladic and Vlastimir Djordjevic, is crucial for confronting impunity. The EU emphasizes the importance of investigating and prosecuting perpetrators of war crimes, including genocide, to uphold human rights and justice. Jurisdictions such as the ICTY and tribunals for Rwanda have played pivotal roles in trying those who evade justice. The EU's commitment to centralised immigration policies also reflects its stance against unpunished violations of humanity.",
