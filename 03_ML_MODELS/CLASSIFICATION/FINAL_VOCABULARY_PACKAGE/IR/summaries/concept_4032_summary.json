  "summary": "The concept of \"merging of the Community institutions,\" commonly referred to as the \"Merger Treaty,\" pertains to the legal framework established to consolidate the various institutions of the European Community into a more cohesive structure. This treaty aimed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of EU governance by streamlining decision-making processes and fostering closer cooperation among institutions. It is pivotal in the evolution of EU law, as it laid the groundwork for the integration of the European Parliament, the Council, and the Commission, thereby reinforcing the principles of unity and coherence within the Union's legal and regulatory framework.",
