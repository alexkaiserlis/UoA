  "summary": "The concept of \"road passenger rights,\" categorized under transport policy, is a redirect to the preferred term \"passenger rights.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, passenger rights encompass a range of protections afforded to individuals traveling by road, including provisions for compensation, assistance, and information in cases of delays, cancellations, or other disruptions. The EU has established regulations to ensure that passengers are treated fairly and equitably, promoting safety and accessibility within the transport sector. These rights are integral to enhancing consumer confidence and fostering a more integrated European transport market.",
