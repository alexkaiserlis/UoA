  "summary": "The concept of \"agricultural disaster\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to significant adverse events, such as storms, flooding, or landslides, that sharply impact agricultural production and yield. These disasters can vary in their effects, leading to considerable detriment for farmers and the mainland population. The EU mobilises solidarity mechanisms to support affected regions, authorizing financial aid to mitigate the consequences of such disasters. Organizations involved in agriculture must navigate compulsory regulations that govern disaster response and recovery, ensuring that stock levels of vegetables and fruit are maintained. The interinstitutional discipline introduced by the EU aims to calculate and address fluctuations in agricultural output, thereby proving essential for resilience against future agricultural disasters.",
