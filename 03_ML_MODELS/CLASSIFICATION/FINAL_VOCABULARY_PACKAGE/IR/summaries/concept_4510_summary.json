  "summary": "The concept of \"surface transport\" pertains to the organization of transport within the European Union, focusing on the regulatory frameworks that govern the movement of goods and passengers via terrestrial modes, such as road and rail. This encompasses a variety of legal instruments aimed at ensuring safety, efficiency, and environmental sustainability in surface transport operations. The EU's regulatory efforts include directives and regulations that facilitate cross-border transport, promote interoperability, and enhance competition among service providers. By establishing a coherent legal framework, the EU aims to optimize surface transport networks, thereby contributing to the broader objectives of the internal market and regional cohesion.",
