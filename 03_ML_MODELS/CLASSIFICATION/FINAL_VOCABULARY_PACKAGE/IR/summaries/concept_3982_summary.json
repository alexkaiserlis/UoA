  "summary": "The concept of \"voting for a single candidate,\" also known as the \"uninominal voting system,\" pertains to electoral procedures within the European Union. This system allows voters to select one candidate from a list, thereby simplifying the voting process and enhancing the clarity of electoral outcomes. In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the uninominal voting system is significant for its potential to streamline representation and ensure that elected officials reflect the preferences of their constituents. As a redirect, this term emphasizes the importance of understanding various electoral methodologies employed across member states, contributing to the broader discourse on democratic practices within the EU.",
