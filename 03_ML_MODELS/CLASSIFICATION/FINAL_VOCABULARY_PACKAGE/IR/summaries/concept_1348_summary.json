  "summary": "Price indexing refers to the systematic adjustment of prices based on a predefined index, crucial in EU legal and regulatory frameworks. This concept is particularly relevant in agricultural markets, where the prices of commodities such as apples, pears, and lemons are indexed to reflect seasonal variations and differing agronomic conditions. For instance, the price of Jonagored apples may be indexed against a coefficient that considers factors like production forecasts and market demand. This indexation is obligatory for ensuring fairness in buying and selling practices, permitting transparency and stability in transactions. Frameworks governing price indexing also address the distillation of prices for various varieties, including hardy grapes and fruited citrus, ensuring that all stakeholders, from farmers to consumers, are treated equitably.",
