  "summary": "The term \"EU acceding countries\" refers to nations that are in the process of joining the European Union, undergoing a rigorous legal and regulatory alignment with EU standards. These countries must comply with the acquis communautaire, which encompasses a vast array of legislation and policies that govern the EU's internal market, economic governance, and social standards. The accession process involves negotiations, assessments, and the implementation of necessary reforms to ensure compatibility with EU laws. Ultimately, successful accession enhances economic integration and fosters political stability, contributing to the broader objectives of the EU's economic geography and regional development.",
