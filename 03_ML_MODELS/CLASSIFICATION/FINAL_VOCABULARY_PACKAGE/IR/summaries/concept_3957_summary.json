  "summary": "The concept of \"alternative sentence\" in EU criminal law refers to non-custodial measures that can be imposed instead of traditional imprisonment. These sentences aim to rehabilitate offenders while ensuring public safety and reducing prison overcrowding. Alternative sentences may include community service, probation, or restorative justice programs, which emphasize the offender's accountability and reintegration into society. The adoption of alternative sentencing practices aligns with the EU's broader objectives of promoting human rights and effective justice systems. By providing alternatives to incarceration, the EU seeks to enhance the proportionality of penalties and support the principles of rehabilitation and social reintegration.",
