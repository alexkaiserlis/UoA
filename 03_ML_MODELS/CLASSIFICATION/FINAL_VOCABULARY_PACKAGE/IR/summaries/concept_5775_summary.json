  "summary": "The term \"CIS countries\" refers to the Commonwealth of Independent States, encompassing several post-Soviet states such as Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these nations are often involved in interministerial dialogues aimed at promoting democratization and reconciliation. The EU's engagement includes addressing destabilising factors, such as arms accumulation and illicit weapons sales, particularly in regions like Ossetia and Transnistria. Initiatives like TACIS have aimed to support civilian liberties and disarmament processes. However, violations of agreements and deteriorated trust, especially with Belarus and Azerbaijan, complicate EU partnerships and hinder progress towards a more stable atmosphere.",
