  "summary": "Underpopulation refers to a demographic condition characterized by a population size that is insufficient to maintain economic and social vitality. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, underpopulation can impact labor markets, social services, and regional development policies. The EU may address underpopulation through various initiatives aimed at promoting demographic sustainability, such as incentivizing migration, enhancing family support policies, and fostering economic opportunities in underpopulated regions. Understanding underpopulation is essential for formulating effective strategies that ensure balanced demographic growth and the preservation of social cohesion within member states.",
