  "summary": "\"Short-term monetary support\" refers to temporary financial assistance provided by EU institutions, primarily aimed at stabilizing economic conditions in member states. This support is often administrated through loans from banks, with stipulations regarding repayment and appropriations. The European Central Bank (ECB) plays a crucial role in marshalling resources to ensure that borrowing is performed efficiently. Such support is valid for projects that enhance infrastructure and operational functions within the entirety of the EU. It is essential for addressing immediate financial needs, particularly in cases where member states face traffic in their economic activities, ensuring that they can renew their economic stability and satisfy statutory borrowing ceilings.",
