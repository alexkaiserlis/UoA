  "summary": "The concept of \"social cohesion,\" redirected to \"economic and social cohesion,\" is pivotal in EU legal frameworks aimed at bolstering intergenerational equity and addressing inequalities. This principle underpins initiatives that promote adaptability and responsiveness to the needs of marginalised groups, including the unemployed and youth. By investing in entrepreneurship and volunteering, the EU seeks to simplify pathways to citizenship and enhance social integration. Taskforces focused on desegregation and flexicurity aim to create a seamless transition for individuals across various ages. Celebrating the anniversary of foundational treaties, the EU continues to announce unprecedented measures that clarify its commitment to fostering social parities and lifelong learning opportunities, thereby enhancing overall GNI.",
