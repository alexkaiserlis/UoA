  "summary": "Catalonia, a region within Spain, is recognized in EU legal and regulatory contexts as a distinct comarca with its own cultural and linguistic identity, notably the català language. The region's diverse habitats, including the coastal areas of Empordà and Osona, are subject to EU regulations concerning marine life, such as cephalopods and gobies, which are often captured using various fishing gears like trawls and seines. Legal frameworks address the sustainable exploitation of these resources, ensuring that fishing practices do not interfere with ecological balance. Additionally, Catalonia's economic activities, including the production of oli and seafood, are monitored through census data and spatial assessments to justify regulatory measures aimed at preserving its unique marine environments.",
