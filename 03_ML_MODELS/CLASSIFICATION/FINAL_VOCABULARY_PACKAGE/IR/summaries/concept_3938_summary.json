  "summary": "The concept of \"right of way,\" often referred to as \"easement\" in EU civil law, pertains to the legal right allowing one party to traverse or utilize another party's property for specific purposes. This legal construct is essential in property law, facilitating access and ensuring the functionality of land use. Easements can be established through various means, including express agreements or implied rights, and are subject to regulatory frameworks that govern their creation and enforcement. In EU legal contexts, understanding the nuances of easements is crucial for property transactions and land development, ensuring compliance with both national and EU regulations.",
