  "summary": "Mayotte, categorized under overseas countries and territories (OCTs), is an integral part of the EU's legal framework, particularly concerning its unique status and regulatory needs. As a French département, it benefits from specific provisions under EU law, aimed at addressing the challenges faced by underdeveloped regions. The local collectivités territoriales are crucial for implementing policies related to agriculture, such as the cultivation of vanilla and ylang, and fisheries, including the sustainable management of lobsters. The topography of Mayotte influences its economic activities, with a focus on sectors like bakery and soaps. The EU's support mechanisms, including the CEEP and funding for infrastructure, aim to stabilize and enhance local agglomerations, ensuring that the region does not become destabilised. Additionally, the integration of local industries, such as the production of creams and paperboard, is essential for fostering economic growth and subsisting livelihoods.",
