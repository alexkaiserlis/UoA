  "summary": "The concept of \"air traffic\" encompasses the regulation and management of aircraft movement within European airspace, focusing on optimised connectivity and situational awareness. EU legal frameworks, such as the Single European Sky (SES) initiative, aim to address bottlenecks and incompatibilities in air traffic management (ATM) systems. This includes leveraging advanced avionics and deploying enablers like GNSS for enhanced trajectory planning. The SESAR program outlines strategic timeframes for implementing flexible air traffic flow management (ATFM) measures, ensuring pilots and controllers can effectively navigate disconnections and aborts. Collaborative efforts with academia and industry, including Eurocae and EATMN, facilitate demonstrations of innovative equipage and reconfiguration strategies, ultimately enhancing overall aeronautical safety and efficiency.",
