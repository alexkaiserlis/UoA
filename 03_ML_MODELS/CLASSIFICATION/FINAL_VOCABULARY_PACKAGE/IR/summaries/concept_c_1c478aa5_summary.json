  "summary": "The concept of \"sanction or restrictive measure of the European Union,\" commonly referred to as \"EU restrictive measure,\" encompasses legal instruments employed by the EU to influence the behavior of states, entities, or individuals. These measures aim to uphold international law, promote peace, and protect human rights by imposing economic or diplomatic restrictions. EU restrictive measures can include asset freezes, trade embargoes, and travel bans, which are enacted in response to violations of international norms or threats to security. As a redirect, this concept highlights the preferred term's significance in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, emphasizing the EU's commitment to maintaining global stability.",
