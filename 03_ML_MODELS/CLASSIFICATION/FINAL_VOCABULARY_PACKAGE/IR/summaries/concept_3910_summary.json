The European Union has established various legal instruments, such as the Race Equality Directive, to combat ethnic discrimination and promote equality. This concept is integral to ensuring that all individuals enjoy equal rights and protection under EU law, fostering a society that respects diversity. The EU actively monitors compliance and implements measures to eradicate ethnic discrimination, reinforcing its commitment to human rights and social justice across member states.",
