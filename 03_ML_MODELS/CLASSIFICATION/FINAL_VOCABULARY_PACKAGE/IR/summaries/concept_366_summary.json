  "summary": "The concept of \"anti-missile missile\" is redirected to the preferred term \"anti-missile defence\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Anti-missile defence systems are critical components of national and collective security strategies, aimed at intercepting and neutralizing incoming missile threats. The EU's regulatory landscape encompasses various directives and policies that govern the development, deployment, and interoperability of such defence systems among member states. This ensures a cohesive approach to enhancing regional security and defense capabilities. The terminology reflects the EU's commitment to addressing emerging threats while fostering collaboration in defence initiatives across its member nations.",
