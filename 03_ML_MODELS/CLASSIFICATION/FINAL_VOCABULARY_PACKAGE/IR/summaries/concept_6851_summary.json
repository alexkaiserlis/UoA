  "summary": "The concept of \"intelligent transport system\" (ITS) encompasses advanced telecommunication and information technologies to enhance the organization of transport within the EU. ITS integrates various components, including shipborne and roadside systems, to improve navigational safety and efficiency. Key elements such as eCall and PSAPs (Public Safety Answering Points) are designed to transmit distress signals and alarms, ensuring traceable communication during emergencies. The EU regulatory framework urges interoperability among systems, facilitating coexistence across different frequencies (e.g., MHz, GHz) and standards set by ETSI and ITU. By deploying intelligent solutions, the EU aims to reduce injuries and enhance comfort for all transport users.",
