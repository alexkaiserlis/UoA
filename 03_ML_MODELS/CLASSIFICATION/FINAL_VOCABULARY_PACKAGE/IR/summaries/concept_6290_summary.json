  "summary": "The \"resolution of the European Council\" refers to formal decisions adopted by the European Council, which comprises the heads of state or government of EU member states. These resolutions play a pivotal role in shaping EU policies and legislative frameworks. They often address significant issues, guiding the Union's strategic direction and responding to pressing challenges. While resolutions are not legally binding, they carry substantial political weight and influence the legislative agenda of the European Union. The resolutions can also serve as a basis for subsequent actions by the European Commission and the European Parliament, thereby impacting the broader regulatory landscape within the EU.",
