  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"heat pump\" refers to a system driven by electricity that transfers heat from one medium to another, such as air, water, or brine. These devices are crucial for eco-friendly heating solutions and are subject to stringent ecolabel criteria to ensure their ecological appropriateness. The EU has established a verification process to assess the performance and efficiency of heat pumps, which includes stages of evaluation and documentation. The validity of these systems is monitored through a revision process, ensuring compliance with current requirements. Heat pumps significantly contribute to the EU's sustainability goals by reducing reliance on gas and promoting renewable energy sources.",
