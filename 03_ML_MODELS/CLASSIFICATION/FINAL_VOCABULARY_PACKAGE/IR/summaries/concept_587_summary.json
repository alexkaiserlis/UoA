  "summary": "Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) are an international reserve asset created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to supplement member countries' official reserves. In the context of EU monetary relations, SDRs play a pivotal role in providing liquidity and stabilizing exchange rates among member states. The European Union recognizes SDRs as a mechanism to enhance financial stability, particularly during economic crises. They can be allocated to EU member states, allowing for increased financial flexibility and support in balance of payments. The legal framework governing SDRs is crucial for ensuring compliance with EU regulations and fostering cooperative monetary relations among member states.",
