  "summary": "The \"draft budget (EU)\" constitutes a provisional instrument that outlines the anticipated revenue and expenditure for the upcoming financial year within the EU framework. It plays a crucial role in the interinstitutional agenda, being examined and adopted by the European Parliament and the Council. The draft budget is prepared in accordance with multiannual financial frameworks and is essential for ensuring sound financial discipline. Each year, the draft budget is placed before the parliaments, allowing for amendments that may be justified. The contents are definitive, aiming for continuity in funding, particularly for sectors like energy and research, including EURATOM. Delays in approval can disrupt planned resources, necessitating a timely review process.",
