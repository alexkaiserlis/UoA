  "summary": "The \"two-hundred-mile zone,\" commonly referred to as the \"exclusive economic zone\" (EEZ), is a critical concept in international law, particularly within EU regulatory frameworks. This zone confers coastal states the right to exercise sovereignty over marine resources, including fisheries and mineral extraction, while obliging them to engage in conservation efforts. Over decades, the EEZ has facilitated the allocation of catch limits for migratory species, such as cod and herring, ensuring sustainable landings. EU regulations mandate that vessels flying the flag of member states abide by specific formalities and limitations when operating within these zones, confirming their readiness to comply with conservation modalities. The EEZ also addresses straddling stocks, ensuring that fishing practices do not exhaust shared resources.",
