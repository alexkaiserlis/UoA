  "summary": "The term \"unskilled worker\" refers to individuals engaged in labor that does not require specialized training or advanced skills. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, unskilled workers often occupy positions in sectors such as agriculture, construction, and services, where the demand for labor is significant. The EU's policies on labor migration, employment rights, and social protection frequently address the status and treatment of unskilled workers, emphasizing their role in the labor market. Regulations aim to ensure fair working conditions and prevent exploitation, thereby promoting a balanced labor market that supports both skilled and unskilled labor forces across member states.",
