  "summary": "The \"mutual solidarity clause,\" often referred to as \"mutual assistance,\" operates within the framework of EU international law, facilitating cooperation among member states. This clause enhances the efficiency of responses to crises by permitting designated authorities to exchange sensitive information and resources expeditiously. It addresses potential infringements of laws and ensures that requests for assistance are processed smoothly and effectively. By establishing networks for prompt communication, the clause allows states to cooperate flexibly, protecting consumer interests and laying down mechanisms for enforcement. Ultimately, it aims to ease the resolution of problems that may hinder the collective security and stability of the EU.",
