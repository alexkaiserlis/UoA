  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, a \"conglomerate\" refers to a business organization that comprises multiple firms operating in diverse sectors, often involving banking, insurance, and investment activities. Such entities are subject to scrutiny to ensure accountability and prudential oversight. Regulatory frameworks aim to clarify definitions and impose restrictions to enhance efficiency and stability. The supervision of conglomerates involves evaluating their structural elements and procedural aspects at regular intervals. This scrutiny is essential for empowering regulatory bodies to exercise oversight effectively. Proposals for supplementary measures may be transposed into national legislation to address concerns and ensure satisfactory compliance with EU standards.",
