  "summary": "Hydroelectric power refers to the generation of electricity through the utilization of flowing or falling water, a renewable energy source that plays a crucial role in the EU's energy strategy. The European Union has established regulatory frameworks to promote sustainable hydroelectric projects, ensuring compliance with environmental directives and energy efficiency standards. These regulations aim to balance energy production with ecological preservation, addressing potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems. As part of the EU's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, hydroelectric power is integral to achieving climate goals, contributing to a transition towards a low-carbon economy while fostering energy security across member states.",
