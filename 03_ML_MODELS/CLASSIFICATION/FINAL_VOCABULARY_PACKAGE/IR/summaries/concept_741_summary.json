  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"food emulsifier\" refers to substances that facilitate the mixing of oily and aqueous components in food products, such as doughs, pizzas, quiches, and tarts. These emulsifiers, including mono- and diglycerides, polysorbates, and lecithins, are crucial for achieving stable emulsions and enhancing texture. Commonly derived from natural sources like acacia and tragacanth, they may also include amidated and lactylated variants. Regulatory oversight ensures that emulsifiers, such as xanthan gum and stearates, meet safety standards, particularly regarding their interaction with nutrients and potential thermal oxidation. Compliance with EU directives on food additives ensures consumer safety and product integrity.",
