  "summary": "The concept of \"road safety\" within EU transport policy encompasses a comprehensive framework aimed at averting crashes and enhancing the safety of all road users, including pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. Regulatory measures focus on the design of junctions and roundabouts, employing traffic calming techniques to reduce speed and improve safety. The integration of advanced technologies, such as eCall systems and speedometers, is essential for real-time monitoring and response. Researches into aerodynamic vehicle designs and retrofitted safety features, like seating retractors and crash alarms, contribute to reducing the heaviest forms of obstruction on roads. Furthermore, initiatives addressing sleep apnoea and driver aggressiveness are crucial for improving overall road safety outcomes.",
