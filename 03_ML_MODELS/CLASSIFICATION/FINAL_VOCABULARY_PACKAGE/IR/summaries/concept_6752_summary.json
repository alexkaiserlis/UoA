  "summary": "Social labelling refers to the practice of providing consumers with information about the social and ethical aspects of products and services, particularly in the context of EU regulations. It aims to promote transparency and responsible business practices by highlighting factors such as fair trade, sustainability, and social equity. In the EU legal framework, social labelling is integral to consumer protection and corporate social responsibility initiatives. It enables consumers to make informed choices while encouraging businesses to adopt socially responsible practices. As a regulatory tool, social labelling fosters a competitive market that values ethical considerations alongside traditional economic factors.",
