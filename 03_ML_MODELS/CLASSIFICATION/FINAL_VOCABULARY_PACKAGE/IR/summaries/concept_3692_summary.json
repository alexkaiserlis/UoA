  "summary": "Composite materials, classified under EU technology and technical regulations, refer to goods that combine two or more distinct materials to achieve enhanced properties. The regulation of these products involves a uniform classification system, which is essential for importation and trade. Authorities invoke specific codes and nomenclature to ensure compliance with binding standards. The classification table includes subdivisions that describe the characteristics of composite materials, allowing for retrospective checking of compliance. This regulatory framework continues to evolve, with additional sections issued to adapt to new developments in textile and other industries. The reasons for these regulations are based on safety and performance considerations, ensuring that all products conform to EU standards.",
