  "summary": "Private law, as a distinct category within the broader framework of legal systems, encompasses the rules governing relationships between private individuals and entities. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, private law includes areas such as contract law, tort law, and property law, which are essential for facilitating private transactions and resolving disputes. The harmonization of private law across member states is crucial for ensuring legal certainty and predictability in cross-border dealings. This legal domain operates alongside public law, which governs relationships involving the state, highlighting the duality of legal frameworks in the EU.",
