  "summary": "The \"powers of the institutions (EU)\" encompass the legal and regulatory frameworks that govern the actions and responsibilities of EU bodies. These institutions, mindful of their roles, engage in participatory processes to address issues such as radicalisation and the integration of marginalised communities, including the Roma. Through mechanisms like codecision, they ensure that diverse topics are framed within a cohesive legal context. The ethical considerations surrounding creditworthiness and managerial practices are focal in their operations. Additionally, the institutions are tasked with researching and intercalibrating policies to combat laundering and terrorism, while also addressing the needs of various stakeholders, including academics and citizens.",
