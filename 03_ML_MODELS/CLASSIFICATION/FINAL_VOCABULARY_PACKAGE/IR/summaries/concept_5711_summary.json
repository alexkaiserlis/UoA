  "summary": "The term \"organic law\" refers to a fundamental legal framework that governs the structure and functioning of a state or organization, particularly within the context of the European Union (EU). Unlike ordinary legislation, organic laws typically require a special legislative procedure for adoption, reflecting their significance in establishing constitutional principles. In the EU, organic laws can pertain to the foundational treaties that delineate the powers and responsibilities of EU institutions, thus influencing the regulatory landscape. These laws ensure a coherent legal order, facilitating the integration of member states while safeguarding fundamental rights and democratic principles within the EU legal system.",
