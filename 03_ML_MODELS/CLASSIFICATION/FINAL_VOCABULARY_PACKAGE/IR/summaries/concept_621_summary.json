  "summary": "The concept of \"trade by country\" pertains to the analysis and regulation of international trade flows between the European Union (EU) and specific nations. This framework is essential for understanding trade balances, tariffs, and compliance with international agreements. In EU legal and regulatory documents, \"trade by country\" facilitates the assessment of economic relationships and the implementation of trade policies. It allows for the monitoring of imports and exports, ensuring adherence to EU standards and regulations. By examining trade patterns, policymakers can make informed decisions to enhance economic cooperation and address trade imbalances with partner countries.",
