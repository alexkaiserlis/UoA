This concept is pivotal in the political landscape, particularly during the legislative process, where stakeholders, including member states and civil society, may articulate their objections. Opposition can manifest through various mechanisms, such as votes in the European Parliament or public consultations, influencing the trajectory of policy development and implementation.
