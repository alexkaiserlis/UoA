  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"welfare services,\" redirected to \"social services,\" encompasses a patchwork of initiatives aimed at supporting citizens, particularly vulnerable groups such as the disabled and victims of crime. These services are designed to be accessible, mobilising resources for accommodation, reintegration, and support during periods of redundancy. The European Globalisation Fund (EGF) plays a crucial role in this framework, proposing measures to assist travellers and adults facing economic challenges. Websites and helplines provide essential information, ensuring that individuals can access necessary services. This division of social services is vital for fostering a recognisable identity and addressing the complexities of modern social protection in a globalised environment.",
