  "summary": "A \"military tribunal,\" often referred to as a \"military court,\" is a specialized judicial body within the legal system that adjudicates offenses committed by military personnel and, in some jurisdictions, civilians in times of war or national emergency. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, military courts operate under distinct procedural rules that differ from civilian courts, reflecting the unique nature of military discipline and operations. The term \"military tribunal\" redirects to \"military court,\" emphasizing the latter's broader acceptance in legal discourse. These courts play a crucial role in maintaining order and accountability within armed forces, ensuring compliance with both national and international law.",
