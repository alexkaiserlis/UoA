  "summary": "A \"swap arrangement\" in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to a financial mechanism that facilitates the exchange of cash flows or financial instruments between parties, often to manage risk or optimize capital allocation. These arrangements are crucial for the free movement of capital within the EU, enabling entities to engage in cross-border transactions efficiently. By allowing for the exchange of currencies or interest rates, swap arrangements contribute to market liquidity and financial stability. The regulatory oversight of such instruments ensures compliance with EU financial regulations, promoting transparency and safeguarding against systemic risks in the financial sector.",
