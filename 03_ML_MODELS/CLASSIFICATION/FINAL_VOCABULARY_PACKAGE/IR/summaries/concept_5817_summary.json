  "summary": "The term \"special procedure\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to a distinct set of protocols designed to expedite judicial processes or address specific legal circumstances. These procedures may diverge from standard practices, allowing for tailored approaches in cases requiring urgent attention or unique considerations. Special procedures are often invoked in matters of significant public interest or where traditional legal avenues may be inadequate. Their implementation ensures that justice is administered efficiently while maintaining adherence to fundamental rights and legal principles, thereby reinforcing the integrity of the EU's judicial system.",
