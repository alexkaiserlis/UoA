These indicators provide critical data for evaluating progress towards sustainability goals, informing policy decisions, and ensuring compliance with environmental legislation. By analyzing trends and changes in environmental indicators, EU institutions can identify areas requiring intervention and monitor the impact of environmental policies. Such indicators are essential for fostering transparency, accountability, and public awareness regarding environmental issues, thereby supporting the EU's commitment to sustainable development and ecological preservation.",
