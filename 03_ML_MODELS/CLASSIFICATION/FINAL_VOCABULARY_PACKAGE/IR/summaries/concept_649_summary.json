  "summary": "A \"controlled economy\" refers to an economic structure where the state exerts significant regulatory influence over production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is crucial for understanding how member states can implement policies that align with market regulations while ensuring social welfare. Controlled economies may arise in response to market failures or economic crises, necessitating interventionist measures. The EUâ€™s regulatory approach often balances free market principles with the need for oversight to promote equitable economic development, ensuring compliance with both internal market rules and broader socio-economic objectives.",
