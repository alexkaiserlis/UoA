Food security encompasses the availability, access, and utilization of food, ensuring that all individuals have sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to maintain a healthy life. The EU addresses food security through various regulations and policies aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity, promoting sustainable practices, and safeguarding food systems against disruptions. This legal framework is essential for mitigating risks associated with food shortages and ensuring resilience in the food supply chain, thereby supporting public health and economic stability across member states.",
