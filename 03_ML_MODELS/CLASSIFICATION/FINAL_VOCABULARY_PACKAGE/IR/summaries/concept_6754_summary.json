  "summary": "A \"reintegration enterprise\" refers to a business entity established within the European Union framework aimed at facilitating the social and economic reintegration of individuals, particularly those who have been marginalized or excluded from the labor market. These enterprises play a crucial role in promoting social inclusion and sustainable employment by providing training, support, and employment opportunities. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, reintegration enterprises are often linked to various funding programs and initiatives aimed at enhancing social cohesion and combating unemployment. They are essential for implementing EU policies that focus on social innovation and the integration of disadvantaged groups into the workforce.",
