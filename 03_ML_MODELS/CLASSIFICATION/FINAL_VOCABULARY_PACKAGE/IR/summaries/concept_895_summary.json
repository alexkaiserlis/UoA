  "summary": "Market research, within the EU legal and regulatory framework, encompasses systematic analyses aimed at understanding consumer behavior and market dynamics. This process is politically significant, as it informs regulators about the rising challenges and opportunities in various sectors, including floricultural and greenhouse industries. By organising thorough surveys and promotional campaigns, stakeholders can stabilise market conditions and enhance consumer satisfaction. The EU encourages member states to commit resources to market research, with findings often earmarked for addressing emissions and electricity consumption forecasts. Such initiatives are vital for liberalisation efforts and for responding to climate change, as outlined in the Kyoto and Copenhagen charters.",
