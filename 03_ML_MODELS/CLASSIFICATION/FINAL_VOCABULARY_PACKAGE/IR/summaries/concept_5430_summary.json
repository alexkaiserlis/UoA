  "summary": "The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a pivotal accord that established a trilateral trade bloc between Canada, Mexico, and the United States, aimed at promoting economic integration and reducing trade barriers. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, NAFTA serves as a comparative model for regional trade agreements, influencing the EU's own trade policies and negotiations. Although NAFTA has been superseded by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), its principles continue to inform discussions on trade liberalization and regulatory alignment within the EU's external relations with extra-European organisations.",
