  "summary": "The concept of \"transit of goods,\" a redirect to the preferred term \"transit,\" encompasses the legal framework governing the movement of goods across borders within the EU. This includes regulations on immobilization and identification processes, such as EORI and ATA carnets, which facilitate unescorted transit. The EU’s regulatory regime aims to streamline procedures while resisting inhumane practices during transport. It echoes the need for tighter controls and staging areas, such as ecopoints, to ensure compliance. Additionally, the involvement of various stakeholders, including customs authorities and transport organizations, is crucial for effective disinfestation and monitoring of goods, ensuring smooth transit operations across member states.",
