  "summary": "The concept of \"tar,\" categorized under the oil industry, is a redirect to the preferred term \"petroleum product\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Tar, often produced through the fractional distillation of crude oil, can pose significant environmental challenges, including air quality issues for smokers and lung health concerns. Regulations may include desulphurization processes to mitigate harmful emissions. The EU community analyzes the implications of tar usage, particularly in relation to restrictions on its application in various sectors. Notably, anomalies in production methods, such as those seen in Iranian and Iraqi contexts, can gravely affect compliance and enforcement. Thus, understanding tar's role in petroleum products is essential for seamless regulatory adherence.",
