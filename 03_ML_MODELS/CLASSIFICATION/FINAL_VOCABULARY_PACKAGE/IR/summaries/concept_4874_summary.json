  "summary": "The term \"slum\" refers to densely populated urban areas characterized by substandard housing, inadequate infrastructure, and poor living conditions. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, slums pose significant challenges to construction and town planning policies aimed at promoting sustainable urban development. The European Union addresses issues related to slum areas through various initiatives, including urban regeneration programs and social housing strategies. These efforts aim to improve living conditions, enhance public health, and foster social inclusion. Effective regulation is essential to mitigate the adverse effects of slums and ensure compliance with EU standards for urban planning and development.",
