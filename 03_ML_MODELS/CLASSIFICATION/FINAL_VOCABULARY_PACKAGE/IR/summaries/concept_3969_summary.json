  "summary": "\"Legal assistance,\" commonly referred to as \"legal aid,\" is a crucial element within the EU's justice framework, aimed at ensuring access to judicial processes for individuals, particularly in cross-border disputes.

This concept is bound by articles that provide guidelines for authorities to improve the position of applicants in need of legal support. The adoption of protocols and documents relating to legal aid aims to enhance the effectiveness of justice systems.
