These acts are essential for the formulation of EU policies and the enactment of laws that impact member states. Legislative acts can take various forms, including regulations, directives, and decisions, each serving distinct legal purposes. They are binding and must be implemented by member states, ensuring uniformity across the EU. The legislative process involves multiple stages, including proposal, debate, and adoption, reflecting the democratic principles of the Union.",
