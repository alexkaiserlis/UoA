  "summary": "Unpaid leave refers to a period during which an employee is permitted to take time off from work without receiving remuneration. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, unpaid leave is often governed by national labor laws and collective agreements, which outline the conditions under which such leave may be granted. This concept is crucial for the organization of work and working conditions, as it allows employees to address personal matters, such as caregiving or education, while maintaining their employment status. The regulation of unpaid leave aims to balance employee rights with organizational needs, ensuring fair treatment in the workplace.",
