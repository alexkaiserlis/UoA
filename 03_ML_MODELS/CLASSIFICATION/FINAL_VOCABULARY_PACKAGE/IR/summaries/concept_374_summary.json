  "summary": "The concept of \"delinquency\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to behaviors that deviate from established legal norms, particularly among youth. It encompasses a range of unlawful activities, often linked to socio-economic factors, which may necessitate intervention from social services and judicial systems. The EU addresses delinquency through various initiatives aimed at prevention and rehabilitation, emphasizing the importance of social integration and support mechanisms. Understanding delinquency is crucial for developing effective policies that promote social cohesion and reduce recidivism, thereby enhancing the overall welfare of communities across member states.",
