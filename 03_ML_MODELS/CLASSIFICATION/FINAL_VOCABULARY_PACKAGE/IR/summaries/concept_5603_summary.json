  "summary": "The concept of \"education of young offenders\" pertains to the pedagogical approaches and regulatory frameworks established within the EU to rehabilitate minors who have committed offenses. This initiative emphasizes the importance of integrating educational programs that address the unique needs of young offenders, promoting their reintegration into society. EU legal instruments advocate for restorative justice and the development of tailored curricula that focus on skill acquisition, moral education, and social reintegration. By prioritizing education over punitive measures, the EU aims to reduce recidivism and foster a more inclusive approach to juvenile justice, aligning with broader human rights standards.",
