  "summary": "The term \"urban centre\" refers to a designated area within a municipality that serves as a focal point for economic, social, and cultural activities. In EU legal and regulatory contexts, urban centres are critical for implementing sustainable urban development policies, promoting efficient land use, and enhancing urban planning frameworks. They often play a pivotal role in the allocation of resources and infrastructure development, aligning with EU directives aimed at fostering cohesive urban growth and addressing challenges such as urban sprawl and environmental sustainability. Effective governance of urban centres is essential for achieving the EU's objectives in regional development and urban policy.",
