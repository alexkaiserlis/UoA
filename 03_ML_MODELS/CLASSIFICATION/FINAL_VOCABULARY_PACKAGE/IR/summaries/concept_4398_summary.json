  "summary": "The \"heavy goods vehicle road tax,\" commonly referred to as \"axle tax,\" is a regulatory framework within EU transport policy aimed at levying charges on heavy vehicles based on their weight and axle configuration. This tax facilitates the optimal redistribution of tolling revenues, ensuring that infrastructure costs are fairly allocated. By incorporating a genuine approach to freight traffic management, the tax incentivizes the use of autonomous vehicles and promotes efficient travel flows across networks. The regulation also addresses the need for revising existing permits and quotas, thereby enhancing organisational efficiency in the carriage of goods. This framework is essential for maintaining lasting transport infrastructures and supporting the trans-European transport network.",
