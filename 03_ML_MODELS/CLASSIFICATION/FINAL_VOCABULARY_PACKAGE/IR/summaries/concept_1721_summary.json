  "summary": "Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is a systematic approach employed in EU legal and regulatory frameworks to evaluate the economic efficiency of various policy options or interventions. By comparing the relative costs and outcomes, CEA aids decision-makers in identifying the most efficient allocation of resources, particularly in public health and environmental policies. This analytical tool is crucial for ensuring that EU funds are utilized effectively, maximizing benefits while minimizing expenditures. The results of CEA inform legislative proposals and regulatory measures, thereby enhancing transparency and accountability in public spending and contributing to the overall objective of sustainable development within the EU.",
