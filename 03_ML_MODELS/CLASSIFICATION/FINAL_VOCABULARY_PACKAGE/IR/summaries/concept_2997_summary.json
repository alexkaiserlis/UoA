  "summary": "The concept of \"private forest\" refers to forested areas owned by private individuals or entities, distinct from public or state-owned forests. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, private forests are subject to specific regulations that aim to promote sustainable forestry practices, biodiversity conservation, and the management of forest resources. The EU's forestry policies encourage the integration of private forest management into broader environmental and economic strategies, ensuring that private owners adhere to standards that enhance ecological balance while also allowing for economic viability. This regulatory approach underscores the importance of private forests in achieving the EU's environmental objectives.",
