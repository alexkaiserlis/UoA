  "summary": "The concept of \"sacred writings,\" redirected to the preferred term \"sacred text,\" pertains to the legal and regulatory frameworks within the EU that recognize the significance of religious and cultural heritage. Sacred texts serve as foundational documents for various belief systems, influencing societal norms and values. In the context of EU law, the protection of sacred texts may intersect with cultural heritage legislation, intellectual property rights, and anti-discrimination policies. By acknowledging the role of sacred texts, EU regulations aim to foster respect for cultural diversity and promote dialogue among different religious communities, thereby enhancing social cohesion and mutual understanding across member states.",
