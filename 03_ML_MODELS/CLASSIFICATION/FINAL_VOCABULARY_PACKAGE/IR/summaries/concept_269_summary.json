  "summary": "The concept of \"education costs\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the financial expenditures associated with providing and accessing education. These costs encompass tuition fees, administrative expenses, and ancillary fees that students may incur. The EU recognizes the importance of addressing education costs to promote equitable access to quality education across member states. Regulatory measures, such as funding programs and financial aid initiatives, aim to alleviate the burden of education costs, thereby fostering educational mobility and enhancing lifelong learning opportunities. Understanding education costs is essential for policymakers to develop effective strategies that ensure inclusivity and support for all learners.",
