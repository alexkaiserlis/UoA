  "summary": "The concept of \"emigration of qualified persons,\" commonly referred to as \"brain drain,\" pertains to the migration of skilled individuals from one country to another, often resulting in a significant loss of human capital for the originating nation. Within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this phenomenon raises concerns regarding labor market dynamics, economic development, and social cohesion. The EU has implemented various policies aimed at mitigating the adverse effects of brain drain, particularly in less developed regions, by promoting retention strategies and facilitating mobility for qualified professionals. Understanding this concept is crucial for addressing the challenges posed by skilled labor emigration in the EU context.",
