  "summary": "Medium-term credit refers to financial instruments typically characterized by repayment periods ranging from one to five years, crucially serving as a stabilizing factor in the EU's financial landscape. This form of credit assists institutions in managing indebtedness and mitigating inflationary shocks. By harmonizing borrowing practices, medium-term credit can strengthen financial resilience against economic turbulence, such as recessions and managerial inefficiencies. It allows for the deferral of repayments, facilitating a more decentralized approach to financing. Moreover, it plays a significant role in the privatization of state-owned enterprises, enhancing convertibility and fostering pluralism in the market.",
