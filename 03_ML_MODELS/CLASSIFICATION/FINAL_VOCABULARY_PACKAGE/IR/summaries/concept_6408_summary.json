In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the management of sewage sludge is critical to preventing the deterioration of the environment. The EU has established directives aimed at regulating the disposal and recovery of sewage sludge to mitigate its potential adverse effects on soil, water, and public health. These regulations promote sustainable practices, ensuring that sewage sludge is treated and utilized in a manner that minimizes environmental impact, thereby supporting the EU's broader environmental protection objectives.",
