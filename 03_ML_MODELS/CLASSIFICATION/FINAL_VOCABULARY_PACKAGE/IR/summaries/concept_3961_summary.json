  "summary": "The \"transfer of prisoners\" concept within EU criminal law pertains to the negotiated arrangements for transferring detained persons between member states. This process involves detailed protocols and guarantees to ensure the security and rights of individuals during their transfer. The implementation of such transfers is often linked to the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), reflecting broader military and defence implications. Agreements are signed to authorise these actions, with representatives from involved states participating in the negotiations. The operational framework includes a mandate for cooperation, ensuring compliance with applicable laws and the effective functioning of the judicial system across the EU.",
