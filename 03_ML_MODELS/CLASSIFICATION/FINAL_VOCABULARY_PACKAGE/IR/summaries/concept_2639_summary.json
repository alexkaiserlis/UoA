  "summary": "The concept of \"price for the marketing year,\" redirected to \"farm prices,\" pertains to the pecuniary arrangements established within EU agricultural regulations. These prices are adjusted annually, reflecting the predominance of market conditions and the need for appropriate measures to support farmers amid fluctuating market dynamics. The EU employs various mechanisms, including vouchers and restitution schemes, to stabilize prices and ensure the replenishment of agricultural estates. This regulatory framework aims to liberalise the market while addressing the tightness in supply chains, particularly for underdeveloped regions. Consequently, these farm prices substantiate the economic viability of diverse agricultural varieties, facilitating exportable goods and enhancing food security.",
