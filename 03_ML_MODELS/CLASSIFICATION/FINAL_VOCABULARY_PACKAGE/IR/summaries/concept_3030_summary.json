  "summary": "The concept of \"expert system,\" redirected to \"artificial intelligence,\" represents a strategic initiative within EU legal and regulatory frameworks aimed at enhancing productivity and promoting technological excellence. These systems, characterized by their advanced forecasting tools, contribute to the viability of enterprises by facilitating knowledge transfers and fostering cooperation among universities and research centres. The pursuit of optimum solutions often reveals incompatibilities and redundancy in existing processes, necessitating a harmonious approach to technological integration. By instituting expert systems, the EU aims to strengthen cohesion and support efforts that encourage exchanges of information, thereby ensuring a competitive edge in the global market.",
