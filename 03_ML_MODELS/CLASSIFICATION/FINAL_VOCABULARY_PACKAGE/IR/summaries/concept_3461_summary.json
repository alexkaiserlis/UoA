  "summary": "An \"international treaty,\" commonly referred to as an \"international agreement,\" is a legally binding instrument that succeeds in establishing obligations among states or international organizations. In the EU context, such agreements are crucial for promoting multilateralism and inclusiveness in international affairs. They often involve complex negotiations, where parties reconvene to discuss terms that are implementable and beneficial. For instance, treaties may address issues like seabed exploration or dolphin conservation, with specific provisions on mortalities and trapping practices. The EU actively engages in bilaterally and plurilateral agreements, underlining its commitment to regularised international cooperation. The successful deposition of treaties culminates in enhanced outreach and dialogue among stakeholders, reflecting the EU's strategic priorities in global governance.",
