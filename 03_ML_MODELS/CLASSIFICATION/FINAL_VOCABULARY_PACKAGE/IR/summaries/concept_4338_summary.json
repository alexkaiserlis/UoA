  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"pasture\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"grassland,\" which encompasses various types of pastureland utilized for grazing livestock. The cultivation of agricultural land, particularly in regions like Salzburg and Styria, involves managing hilly slopes and marshy areas where roughage is available. Regulatory frameworks address issues such as transhumance, ensuring that keepers can utilize these lands without nuisance or inconvenience. The abandonment of pastureland can lead to dwindling biodiversity and affect local economies. Moreover, the acoustic environment, influenced by noises from livestock and machinery like lawnmowers, is considered in land use planning. Effective management of these areas is crucial for maintaining fertile land and supporting breeders' progeny, thereby enhancing the agricultural sector's productivity and sustainability.",
