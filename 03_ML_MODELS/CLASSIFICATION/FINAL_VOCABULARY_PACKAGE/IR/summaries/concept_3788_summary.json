  "summary": "The \"reactor cooling system\" is a critical component within the electrical and nuclear industries, ensuring the safe operation of nuclear reactors by regulating temperature and preventing overheating. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such systems are subject to stringent safety standards and compliance measures outlined in directives and regulations governing nuclear safety. These frameworks aim to mitigate risks associated with nuclear energy production, ensuring that reactor cooling systems are designed, maintained, and operated in accordance with best practices. The EU emphasizes the importance of robust regulatory oversight to protect public health and the environment from potential hazards linked to nuclear technology.",
