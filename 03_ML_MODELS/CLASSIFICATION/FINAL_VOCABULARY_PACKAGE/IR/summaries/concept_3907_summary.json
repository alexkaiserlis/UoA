  "summary": "The concept of \"worker motivation,\" redirected to \"job satisfaction,\" is pivotal in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks governing the organisation of work and working conditions. Job satisfaction encompasses various factors influencing employee morale and productivity, which are crucial for fostering a positive work environment. EU directives emphasize the importance of ensuring that working conditions promote well-being and engagement, thereby enhancing overall job satisfaction. This alignment with EU policies aims to create a more motivated workforce, ultimately contributing to economic growth and social cohesion within member states. Understanding this relationship is essential for effective implementation of labour regulations.",
