  "summary": "The \"revision of an agreement\" in EU legal and regulatory contexts refers to the formal process of amending existing international treaties or accords. This process may involve ratifying new terms, which can include the inclusion of provisions to address issues such as laundering or the management of hazardous substances like chrysotile and methamidophos. The revision can be initiated through denunciation or by tacitly agreeing to modifications, ensuring compliance with evolving standards, such as those set by MEPC and MARPOL. It is essential for overseeing international collaborations, including those related to watercourses and environmental protection, while addressing eventualities like collisions or forgery. The process is governed by strict authentication protocols to uphold the integrity of agreements, often requiring the affixing of signatures from all parties involved.",
