  "summary": "The term \"Cariforum\" refers to the group of Caribbean Forum countries, which are significant in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks. As an extra-European organisation, Cariforum plays a crucial role in fostering trade relations and cooperation between the European Union and Caribbean nations. The EU's engagement with Cariforum is primarily facilitated through the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), which aims to promote sustainable development and economic growth. This relationship underscores the EU's commitment to enhancing trade partnerships beyond its borders, thereby contributing to global economic integration and development in the Caribbean region.",
