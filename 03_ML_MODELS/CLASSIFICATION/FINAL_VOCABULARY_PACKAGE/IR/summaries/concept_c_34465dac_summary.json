  "summary": "\"Procurement digitalisation,\" commonly referred to as \"e-procurement,\" is a pivotal concept within the EU's trade policy framework, particularly as it pertains to enhancing efficiency and transparency in public procurement processes. This digital transformation facilitates the electronic handling of procurement activities, thereby streamlining procedures, reducing administrative burdens, and promoting competitive bidding. The EU's legal and regulatory documents emphasize the importance of e-procurement in achieving compliance with directives aimed at fostering a more integrated and accessible internal market. As a redirect term, \"procurement digitalisation\" underscores the broader implications of e-procurement in modernizing public sector operations across member states.",
