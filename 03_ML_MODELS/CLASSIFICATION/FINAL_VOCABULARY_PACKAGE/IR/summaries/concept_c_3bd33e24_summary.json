  "summary": "The Bologna Process represents a significant cooperation policy within the European Higher Education Area, aimed at harmonizing higher education systems across participating countries. Initiated in 1999, it seeks to enhance the quality and comparability of academic qualifications, thereby facilitating student mobility and employability. The legal framework established through the Bologna Process promotes the adoption of a three-cycle system (bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees) and the implementation of a European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS). This regulatory initiative underscores the EU's commitment to fostering educational collaboration and ensuring that higher education meets the evolving demands of the labor market.",
