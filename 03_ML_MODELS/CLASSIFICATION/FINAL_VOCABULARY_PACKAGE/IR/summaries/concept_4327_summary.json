  "summary": "The concept of \"utilised agricultural area,\" a preferred term in EU regulatory documents, pertains to land actively cultivated for agricultural purposes. This area encompasses diverse farming systems, including rows of crops like chickpeas and linseed, which are crucial for sustainable practices. In certain circumstances, municipalities may reclaim urbanized spaces for agricultural use, promoting agrienvironmental benefits. The EU's regulatory framework aims to prevent overproduction and overshoots in agricultural outputs, ensuring that all applications of land are legitimate and beneficial. By fostering cooperation among subregions, such as maatalouspiiri and Kymi, the EU supports simplified processes for transferring agricultural land, thereby liberating resources for innovative growings.",
