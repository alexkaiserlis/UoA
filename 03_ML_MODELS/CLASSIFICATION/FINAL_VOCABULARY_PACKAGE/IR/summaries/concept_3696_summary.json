  "summary": "The term \"ultra-fine particle\" refers to particulate matter with a diameter of less than 100 nanometers, which poses significant health and environmental risks. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, ultra-fine particles are subject to stringent regulations aimed at mitigating their impact on air quality and public health. The European Union has established guidelines and directives that govern emissions from various sources, including industrial processes and transportation, to limit exposure to these hazardous substances. Monitoring and assessment of ultra-fine particles are crucial for compliance with EU environmental standards, ensuring the protection of citizens and ecosystems from their adverse effects.",
