  "summary": "The concept of \"international debt,\" redirected to \"external debt,\" pertains to the obligations of sovereign states to foreign creditors. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, external debt is crucial for understanding monetary relations among member states and their interactions with global financial institutions. This concept encompasses the legal responsibilities arising from loans and financial agreements, which can impact economic stability and compliance with EU regulations. Monitoring external debt levels is essential for maintaining fiscal discipline and ensuring that member states adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact, thereby fostering sustainable economic governance within the EU.",
