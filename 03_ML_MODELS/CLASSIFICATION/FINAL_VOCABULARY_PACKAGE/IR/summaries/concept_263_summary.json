  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"broker\" refers to an intermediary entity engaged in the facilitation of transactions between buyers and sellers within distributive trades. Brokers play a crucial role in ensuring market efficiency by providing access to goods and services, negotiating terms, and often handling logistics. They are subject to various regulatory requirements, including licensing and compliance with consumer protection laws, which aim to safeguard market integrity and consumer rights. The role of brokers is particularly significant in sectors such as finance, real estate, and commodities, where regulatory oversight is essential to prevent malpractice and ensure fair trading practices.",
