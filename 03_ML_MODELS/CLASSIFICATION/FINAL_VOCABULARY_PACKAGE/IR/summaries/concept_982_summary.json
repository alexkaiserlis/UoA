  "summary": "Tenant farming, a system where farmers cultivate land owned by others in exchange for a share of the produce, plays a significant role in the agricultural landscape of the EU. This practice is governed by various legal frameworks that ensure equitable distribution of resources and rights between landowners and tenants. EU regulations may address issues such as land tenure security, agricultural subsidies, and sustainable farming practices, promoting tenant farming as a viable option for enhancing food production and rural development. The legal implications of tenant farming are crucial for maintaining agricultural diversity and supporting smallholder farmers within the EU's Common Agricultural Policy.",
