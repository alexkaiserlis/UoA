  "summary": "The concept of \"level of training,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"level of education,\" is crucial in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning educational policies. It encompasses the ISCED classifications established by UNESCO, providing a structured breakdown of educational attainment across member nations. This metric is essential for harmonization efforts, as it allows for the comparison of educational statistics and competencies across different regions. Ongoing revisions and adaptations of training programs ensure that they meet the evolving needs of the workforce, confirming that professionals possess the necessary qualifications. The EU's policies stipulate that educational structures must support cultural and economic drivers, thereby enhancing the overall competence of citizens engaged in various sectors, including tourism and transport.",
