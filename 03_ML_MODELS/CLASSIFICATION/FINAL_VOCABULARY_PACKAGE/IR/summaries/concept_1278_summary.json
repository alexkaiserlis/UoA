  "summary": "The concept of \"river hydrology,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"hydrology,\" is integral to understanding water resource management within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Hydrology encompasses the study of water distribution, movement, and properties, essential for developing sustainable practices in river basin management. EU directives, such as the Water Framework Directive, rely on hydrological data to ensure the protection and restoration of water bodies. Effective hydrological assessments inform policies aimed at mitigating flood risks and enhancing water quality, thereby supporting the EU's environmental objectives and promoting a cohesive approach to natural resource governance across member states.",
