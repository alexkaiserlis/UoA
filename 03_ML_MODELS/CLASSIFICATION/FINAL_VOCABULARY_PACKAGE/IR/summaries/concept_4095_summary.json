  "summary": "Silkworm farming, more accurately termed \"sericulture,\" is a specialized agricultural activity within the EU framework, focusing on the rearing of silkworms for silk production. This practice entails the cultivation of silkworks, where rearers manage the lifecycle of silkworms, from eggs to cocoons. Regulatory documents emphasize the need for centralization in the sector to stabilize economies and ensure quality standards. The drafting of operative guidelines aims to address gaps in production, allowing for the reallocation of resources and expenses. Attendant occupations are also impacted, as the formation of silk fibres necessitates a rationality in practices. The EU's agrimonetary policies may amplify support for sericulture, ensuring that the sector is reinstated as a viable economic activity.",
