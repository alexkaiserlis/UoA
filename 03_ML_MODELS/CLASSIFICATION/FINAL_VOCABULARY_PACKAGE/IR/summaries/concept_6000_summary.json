  "summary": "The concept of \"working class\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to a socio-economic group characterized by their employment in manual or industrial labor, often facing distinct challenges related to labor rights, social protection, and economic equity. The EU recognizes the importance of addressing the needs of the working class through various directives and regulations aimed at promoting social inclusion and fair working conditions. This demographic is central to discussions on labor market policies, social dialogue, and the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, which seeks to enhance the welfare and rights of all workers, thereby fostering a more equitable society.",
