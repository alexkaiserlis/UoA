  "summary": "The concept of \"conspiracy theory\" pertains to the dissemination of unverified narratives suggesting covert plots by powerful entities, often undermining public trust in institutions. Within the EU legal and regulatory framework, conspiracy theories can pose significant challenges, particularly in the realms of communications and information integrity. The proliferation of such theories may contravene regulations aimed at protecting public discourse and ensuring the accuracy of information. EU bodies are increasingly tasked with addressing the implications of conspiracy theories on social cohesion and democratic processes, necessitating a nuanced approach to regulation that balances freedom of expression with the need for factual accountability.",
