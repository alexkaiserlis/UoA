  "summary": "The \"provisional twelfth\" refers to a temporary budgetary allocation mechanism within the European Union's financial framework. It allows for the disbursement of funds during the early months of a new financial year, ensuring continuity in the implementation of EU policies and programs. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining operational stability while awaiting the final approval of the annual budget. The provisional twelfth is calculated based on the previous year's budget, facilitating immediate access to resources for essential activities. This regulatory provision underscores the EU's commitment to efficient financial management and timely execution of its legislative agenda.",
