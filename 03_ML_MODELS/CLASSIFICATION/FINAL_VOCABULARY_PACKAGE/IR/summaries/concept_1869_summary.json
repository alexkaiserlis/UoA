  "summary": "The term \"ex-serviceman\" refers to an individual who has previously served in the armed forces. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is significant for various policies related to international security, veterans' rights, and social integration. Ex-servicemen may be entitled to specific benefits, support programs, and protections under EU legislation aimed at promoting their reintegration into civilian life. The EU recognizes the unique challenges faced by ex-servicemen, including mental health issues and employment barriers, and thus implements measures to ensure their well-being and facilitate their transition, aligning with broader objectives of social cohesion and security.",
