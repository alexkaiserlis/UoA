  "summary": "The concept of \"search engine\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to digital platforms that facilitate the retrieval of information from the internet. These engines play a critical role in communications, enabling users to access vast amounts of data efficiently. The EU has established regulations governing search engines, particularly concerning data protection, privacy, and competition law. Notably, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes stringent obligations on search engines regarding user consent and data handling. Furthermore, the Digital Services Act aims to enhance accountability and transparency, ensuring that search engines operate fairly and do not engage in discriminatory practices.",
