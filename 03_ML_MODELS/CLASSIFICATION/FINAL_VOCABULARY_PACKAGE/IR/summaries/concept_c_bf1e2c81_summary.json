  "summary": "The concept of \"mass data,\" redirected to \"big data,\" encompasses the vast volumes of information generated and processed through advanced information technology and data processing techniques. In the EU legal and regulatory context, big data presents both opportunities and challenges, particularly concerning data protection, privacy rights, and compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The regulation emphasizes the need for transparency, accountability, and ethical use of data, ensuring that individuals' rights are safeguarded amidst the proliferation of data analytics. As the EU continues to develop its digital single market, the implications of big data on innovation, competition, and consumer protection remain pivotal.",
