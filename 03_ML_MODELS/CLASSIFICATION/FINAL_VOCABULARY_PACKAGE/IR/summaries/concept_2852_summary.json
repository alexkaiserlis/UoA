  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"prototype\" refers to an initial model or version of a product, system, or process that is developed to test concepts and feasibility before full-scale production or implementation. Prototypes are crucial in technology and technical regulations, as they allow for the assessment of compliance with EU standards and directives. This iterative process facilitates innovation while ensuring that safety, environmental, and performance criteria are met. Regulatory bodies may require prototypes to undergo rigorous evaluation to ensure they align with established technical regulations, thereby safeguarding public interest and promoting technological advancement within the EU.",
