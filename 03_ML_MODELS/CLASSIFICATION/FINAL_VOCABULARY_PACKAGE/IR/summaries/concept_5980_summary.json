  "summary": "Seasonal unemployment refers to the temporary cessation of employment opportunities that occurs in specific sectors, particularly agriculture, tourism, and construction, due to seasonal fluctuations in demand. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, seasonal unemployment is significant for the formulation of policies aimed at labor market stability and social protection. The EU recognizes the need for measures to support affected workers, such as unemployment benefits and retraining programs, to mitigate the adverse effects of seasonal unemployment. This concept is crucial for understanding employment dynamics and informing legislative initiatives within the EU's broader economic strategy.",
