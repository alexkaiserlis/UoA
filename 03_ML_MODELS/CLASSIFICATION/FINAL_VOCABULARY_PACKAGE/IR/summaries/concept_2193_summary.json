  "summary": "Barley, classified under the EU category of plant products, plays a significant role in agricultural regulation and trade. It is essential for various applications, including the production of whiskey and as a key ingredient in breweries. The legal framework governing barley encompasses aspects such as quality control, where parameters like glucans and sterility are scrutinized. Regulatory bodies engage in negotiations regarding subquota allocations, ensuring that trade remains fair and negotiable. Additionally, barley's merchandising involves complex logistics, where lorries transport bushels across borders. The EU's commitment to maintaining high standards is reflected in its stringent sieves and apertures for quality assessment, addressing concerns about overheated or shrivelled kernels.",
