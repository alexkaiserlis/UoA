  "summary": "Jamaica, categorized under political geography, plays a significant role in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning trade and sanitary standards. The EU engages in demarcations of marine resources, ensuring that products like bivalve molluscs and gastropods are harvested under strict hygiene regulations. Inspections of coldstores and factories in Jamaica are vital for verifying compliance with EU standards. The Ministry of Agriculture collaborates with EU laboratories to ensure that toxins and pollutants are below permissible levels. Additionally, the equivalence of sanitary measures is crucial for the dispatch of frozen seafood, which must be affixed with appropriate markings and assurances before being relayed to EU markets.",
