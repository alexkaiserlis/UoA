  "summary": "The concept of \"IoT,\" or \"Internet of Things,\" pertains to a network of interconnected devices that communicate and exchange data over the internet. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, IoT raises significant considerations regarding data protection, cybersecurity, and interoperability. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Cybersecurity Act are pivotal in governing the use of IoT technologies, ensuring that personal data is safeguarded and that devices meet stringent security standards. As the EU continues to develop its Digital Single Market, the integration of IoT will necessitate comprehensive regulatory measures to address emerging challenges and promote innovation.",
