In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such products must comply with stringent food safety standards, including labeling requirements and nutritional information as outlined in Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011. Additionally, the production and marketing of freeze-dried products are subject to the General Food Law (Regulation (EC) No 178/2002), ensuring consumer protection and traceability. These regulations aim to guarantee that freeze-dried products are safe for consumption and meet quality standards across the EU market.",
