  "summary": "The \"plant variety right\" is a legal framework within the EU that affords holders exclusive rights to propagate and reproduce specific plant varieties, thereby safeguarding horticulture innovation. This right evolved to enhance the attractiveness of investing in new varieties, offering an incentive for breeders. The system involves a centralised filing process, where appellants can submit applications for denomination and registration. Impediments to obtaining these rights may include confusion over existing denominations or the suitability of the variety. Fees are charged for filing and maintenance, with surcharges possibly applied for late payments. Appeals against refusals are facilitated, ensuring rationality and fairness in the process.",
