  "summary": "A \"government statement\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to an official declaration made by a governmental authority, often articulating policy positions, legislative intentions, or responses to specific issues. Such statements serve as instruments of executive power, reflecting the accountability of public service entities to both the legislature and the citizenry. They are crucial for transparency and can influence public discourse and legislative processes. In the EU, government statements may also align with broader regulatory objectives, ensuring that member states adhere to common policies and standards, thereby fostering cohesion and compliance within the Union.",
