  "summary": "The term \"clergy\" refers to individuals ordained for religious duties and functions within various faiths, playing a pivotal role in the cultural and religious landscape of the European Union. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the clergy may be involved in discussions surrounding religious freedom, the protection of cultural heritage, and the promotion of interfaith dialogue. Legal instruments, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, safeguard the rights of clergy members, ensuring their ability to practice and promote their beliefs without discrimination. This concept underscores the EU's commitment to uphold cultural diversity and religious pluralism.",
