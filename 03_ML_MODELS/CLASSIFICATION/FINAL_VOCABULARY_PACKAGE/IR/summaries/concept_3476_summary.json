  "summary": "The concept of \"international issue\" within the category of international security pertains to matters that transcend national boundaries and require collaborative regulatory frameworks among EU member states. Such issues often encompass threats to peace, stability, and human rights, necessitating a cohesive legal response. The EU's approach involves establishing treaties, directives, and regulations that address these challenges collectively. The legal instruments developed aim to enhance cooperation in areas such as conflict resolution, arms control, and counter-terrorism. By addressing international issues, the EU seeks to fortify its security architecture and promote a stable global order, reflecting its commitment to multilateralism and the rule of law.",
