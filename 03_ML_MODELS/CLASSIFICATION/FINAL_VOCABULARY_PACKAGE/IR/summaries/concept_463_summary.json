  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"preservative agent,\" redirected to \"preservative,\" refers to substances that inhibit spoilage in food products. These agents, such as benzoates and sorbates, play a crucial role in maintaining the quality of various foods, including beers and vermouth, by preventing microbial growth and degradation. For instance, methylpropionic and metabisulphite are commonly used to enhance aromas and prevent rotten flavors. Regulatory frameworks ensure that preservatives like natamycin and orthophenylphenol are safe for consumption, while also addressing potential contaminations. The synergistic effects of these agents can improve product stability, making them essential in food technology and preservation practices across the EU.",
