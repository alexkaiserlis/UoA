  "summary": "The concept of \"use of aid\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the disbursement and management of financial assistance aimed at modernisation and diversification of sectors such as agriculture. This includes support for specific crops like buckwheat and linseed, as well as initiatives like afforestation. The aid's effective delivery is crucial for stabilizing markets and ensuring compliance with judgements from the European Court. Regulatory bodies often engage in enquiries and verifications to ascertain proper usage, while processors may face chargeable repayments if aid is misallocated. The decentralised approach allows for tailored support, fostering sectorial growth across diverse lands, including those in Bangladesh and Rotterdam.",
