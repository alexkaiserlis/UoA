  "summary": "The \"economic system\" concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to the structured organization of economic activities and interactions among member states. It encompasses various elements, including market dynamics, regulatory mechanisms, and institutional frameworks that govern economic behavior. The EU's economic system is characterized by principles such as competition, cohesion, and sustainability, which aim to foster economic growth and social welfare. Regulatory documents often address the economic system to ensure compliance with EU policies, promote fair trade practices, and enhance market integration. Understanding this concept is crucial for analyzing the impact of EU legislation on member states' economies.",
