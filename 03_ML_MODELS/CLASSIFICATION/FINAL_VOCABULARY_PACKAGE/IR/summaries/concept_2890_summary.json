  "summary": "The \"repatriation of capital\" refers to the process whereby entities, including individuals and businesses, transfer funds back to their country of origin, often from abroad. Within the EU legal framework, this concept is crucial for ensuring compliance with regulations that govern the free movement of capital. Notably, measures aimed at avoiding the circumvention of capital controls are defined under relevant legislation. Authorities are empowered to implement remedial actions, particularly in cases where funds are deemed to be frozen or held in territories with inadequate legal protections. The position of governments, including those of Serbia and former Yugoslavia, is also considered, as repatriation may encompass additional complexities related to competition and economic stability.",
