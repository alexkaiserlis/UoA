  "summary": "The concept of \"rural population\" pertains to the demographic classification of individuals residing in non-urban areas within the European Union. This classification is crucial for various EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly those addressing rural development, agricultural policy, and regional cohesion. Understanding the rural population is essential for implementing targeted initiatives aimed at enhancing socio-economic conditions, preserving cultural heritage, and promoting sustainable development in these areas. The EU's commitment to addressing the unique challenges faced by rural populations is reflected in policies that aim to improve access to services, infrastructure, and economic opportunities, thereby fostering balanced territorial development across member states.",
