  "summary": "Imperialism, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the practice of extending a nation's authority through territorial acquisition or establishing economic and political dominance over other regions. This concept is significant in discussions on international security, particularly regarding the EU's foreign policy and its stance on global governance. The EU seeks to promote stability and peace, countering imperialistic tendencies that may threaten sovereignty and human rights. Regulatory measures may include sanctions or diplomatic efforts aimed at curbing aggressive imperialistic actions, thereby reinforcing the EU's commitment to multilateralism and cooperative international relations.",
