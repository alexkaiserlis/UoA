  "summary": "The concept of \"socio-economic group,\" categorized under the social framework in EU legal and regulatory contexts, is redirected to the preferred term \"social class.\" This term encompasses the stratification of individuals based on economic status, education, and occupation, which influences their access to resources and opportunities within the EU. Understanding social class is crucial for formulating policies aimed at reducing inequality and promoting social cohesion. The EU employs this concept in various directives and regulations to address issues such as social inclusion, labor rights, and economic development, ensuring that legislative measures consider the diverse needs of different social classes across member states.",
