  "summary": "The concept of \"scientific progress\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses advancements in research and intellectual property, crucial for fostering innovation. It includes the development of products such as somatotropin and its derivatives, which are subject to rigorous safety assessments by bodies like the SCCP and SCCS. Regulatory measures ensure that substances in deodorants and shampoos do not cause irritation or uncorrected conditions like diplopia. Timeliness in administrative processes is vital for the approval of new technologies, including microlight aeroplanes and autopilot systems. Furthermore, the concept addresses the incompleteness of existing definitions, promoting clarity in regulatory texts to avoid prejudging outcomes.",
