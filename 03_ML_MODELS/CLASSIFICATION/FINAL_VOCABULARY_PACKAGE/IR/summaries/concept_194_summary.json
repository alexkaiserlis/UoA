  "summary": "An \"industry-wide collective agreement,\" often redirected to the preferred term \"collective agreement,\" is a legally binding contract negotiated between signatories representing workers and employers within a specific sector. These agreements aim to establish harmonious working conditions, addressing issues such as holidays, rest periods, and safe working environments. They are crucial for achieving a dignified workplace and ensuring that workers' rights are codified and respected. In the EU context, these agreements facilitate dialogue among various actors, including federations and mobile workers, while adhering to principles of proportionality and subsidiarity. They illustrate the correlation between legal frameworks and the need for healthy labour relations, ultimately promoting an interoperable and equitable domain for all involved.",
