  "summary": "Underwater mineral resources refer to the valuable geological materials found beneath the seabed, which include metals, minerals, and hydrocarbons. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the exploration and exploitation of these resources are governed by various directives and regulations aimed at ensuring environmental protection, sustainable use, and the preservation of marine biodiversity. The EU emphasizes the need for comprehensive assessments and permits prior to any extraction activities, aligning with international conventions such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This regulatory approach seeks to balance economic interests with ecological integrity in marine environments.",
