  "summary": "The concept of \"stability of the financial system,\" redirected to \"financial stability,\" is crucial within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning the free movement of capital. Financial stability refers to a condition where the financial system operates efficiently, without excessive volatility, thereby ensuring confidence among investors and consumers. The EU implements various regulatory measures to safeguard financial stability, including the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and adherence to the Capital Requirements Directive. These initiatives aim to mitigate systemic risks and promote a resilient financial environment, essential for maintaining the integrity of the internal market and facilitating economic growth.",
