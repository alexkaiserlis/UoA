  "summary": "A \"labour dispute\" refers to a conflict between employers and employees regarding employment conditions, rights, or obligations under labour law and labour relations. In the context of EU legal frameworks, such disputes may arise from issues like wage negotiations, working conditions, or collective bargaining agreements. The European Union promotes harmonization of labour standards across member states to mitigate such disputes, ensuring fair treatment and protection of workers' rights. Regulatory mechanisms, including directives and regulations, aim to facilitate resolution processes, thereby fostering stable industrial relations and enhancing social dialogue within the EU.",
