  "summary": "The concept of \"tariff zone\" within the EU transport policy framework refers to a designated area where specific customs duties and tariffs are applied uniformly. This regulatory construct is essential for facilitating trade and ensuring compliance with EU customs regulations. Tariff zones help streamline the movement of goods across borders, allowing for efficient transport logistics while maintaining economic cohesion among member states. By establishing clear tariff boundaries, the EU aims to enhance market access and promote fair competition. Understanding tariff zones is crucial for stakeholders involved in international trade, customs administration, and transport policy implementation within the EU legal context.",
