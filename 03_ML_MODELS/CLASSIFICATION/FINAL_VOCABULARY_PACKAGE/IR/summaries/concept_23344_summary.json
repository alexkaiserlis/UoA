  "summary": "The concept of \"business-to-business\" (B2B) refers to transactions and interactions between businesses, rather than between businesses and consumers. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, B2B relationships are crucial for understanding market dynamics, competition law, and trade regulations. The EU's regulatory instruments often address B2B practices to ensure fair competition, prevent anti-competitive behavior, and protect the integrity of the internal market. B2B agreements may also be subject to specific directives, such as those governing unfair trading practices, which aim to create a balanced environment for enterprises. Understanding B2B dynamics is essential for compliance and strategic business operations within the EU.",
