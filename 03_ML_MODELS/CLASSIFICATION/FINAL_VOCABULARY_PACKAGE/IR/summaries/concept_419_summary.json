  "summary": "Civil disobedience refers to the intentional act of disobeying laws or regulations as a form of protest against perceived injustices, often in the context of political and public safety issues. Within the EU legal framework, civil disobedience can raise complex questions regarding the balance between individual rights and state authority. While the EU upholds fundamental rights such as freedom of expression and assembly, it also emphasizes the necessity of maintaining public order. Consequently, instances of civil disobedience may lead to legal scrutiny, particularly when they challenge established regulations or threaten public safety, necessitating a nuanced understanding of both legal and ethical implications.",
