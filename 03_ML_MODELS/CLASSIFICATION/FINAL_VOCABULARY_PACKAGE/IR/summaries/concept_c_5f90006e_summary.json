  "summary": "A \"social enterprise\" within the EU legal framework refers to a business organization that prioritizes social objectives alongside financial sustainability. These entities often operate under specific regulatory guidelines that promote social innovation and community engagement, distinguishing them from traditional profit-driven enterprises. The EU supports social enterprises through various funding mechanisms and frameworks, recognizing their role in addressing societal challenges and fostering inclusive growth. Legal definitions and regulations may vary across member states, but the overarching goal remains consistent: to balance economic viability with social impact, thereby contributing to the EU's broader objectives of cohesion and social responsibility.",
