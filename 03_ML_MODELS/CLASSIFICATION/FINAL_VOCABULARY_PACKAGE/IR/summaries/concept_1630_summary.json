  "summary": "The \"free movement of capital\" is a fundamental principle within EU law, aimed at liberalising financial transactions across member states. This concept facilitates the inflow of investments, enhancing prosperity amid fragmented markets. It addresses barriers that hinder capital movement, such as restrictive regulations on privatised estates and the leasing of lands. By loosening these constraints, the EU seeks to exert a predominance in global finance, allowing investors to navigate an unfinished landscape of opportunities. However, challenges remain, including the need for restitution of improperly administrated assets and the impact of unsettled legal frameworks that can weaken investor confidence.",
