  "summary": "Long-term credit refers to financial instruments provided by institutions that are characterized by extended maturity periods, often exceeding one year. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these credits are crucial for facilitating investments in ambitious projects, particularly in sectors undergoing transformation. They can be denominated in various currencies, including euros and francs, and are often tied to macroeconomic stabilization efforts. The European Investment Bank (EIB) and other specialized entities may offer long-term credit to support privatization reforms and restore economic stability. Such financing can be structured in tranches, with instalments designed to ease repayment burdens, thus benefiting both lenders and borrowers. Judgments regarding the compatibility of these credits with EU regulations can influence their availability and terms, impacting the overall financial landscape.",
