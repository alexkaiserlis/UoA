  "summary": "The concept of \"Macedonia\" within the EU legal framework pertains to a region characterized by its complex geopolitical landscape, notably its interactions with neighboring countries such as Serbia and Kosovo. The EU has established roadmaps for the decentralization of governance and the facilitation of biometric passport issuance, aiming to enhance travel and migration benchmarks. The Thessaloniki Agenda emphasizes the importance of dialogue and cooperation among Balkan states, including Albania and Montenegro. Additionally, the EU's efforts in stabilisation and liberalisation of visa policies are crucial for residents seeking Schengen access. This framework underscores the EU's commitment to authenticating citizenship and fostering regional integration.",
