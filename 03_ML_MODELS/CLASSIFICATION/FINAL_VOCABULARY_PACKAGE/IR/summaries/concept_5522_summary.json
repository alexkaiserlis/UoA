  "summary": "A \"trade union confederation\" refers to an overarching organization that unites various trade unions, representing collective interests in the realm of labour law and labour relations within the European Union. These confederations play a pivotal role in advocating for workers' rights, negotiating collective agreements, and influencing policy at both national and EU levels. They serve as a critical intermediary between workers and employers, ensuring that labour standards are upheld and promoting social dialogue. In the context of EU regulations, trade union confederations contribute to shaping legislative frameworks that govern employment practices and enhance social protection across member states.",
