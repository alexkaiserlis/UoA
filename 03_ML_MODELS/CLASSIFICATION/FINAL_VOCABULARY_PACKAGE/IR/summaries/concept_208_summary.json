  "summary": "Cultural cooperation within the EU framework refers to the establishment of collaborative efforts aimed at promoting and facilitating cultural exchanges among member states. This cooperation is governed by protocols that oversee various fields, including audiovisual media and cultural productions. Officials negotiate agreements that confer entitlements to individuals and professionals, ensuring the continuation of cultural freedoms. The EU's commitment to cultural cooperation is evident in its provisions for unanimity in decision-making and the involvement of senior arbitrators and tribunals to resolve disputes. By invoking expertise and facilitating exchanges, the EU aims to foster a vibrant cultural landscape, serving the interests of diverse communities across Europe.",
