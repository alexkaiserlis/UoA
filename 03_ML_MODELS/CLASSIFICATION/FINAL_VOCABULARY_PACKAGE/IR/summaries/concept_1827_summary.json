  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"high-temperature materials,\" redirected to the preferred term \"heat-resisting materials,\" encompasses a range of substances, including refractories and magnesia-based compounds, such as magnesite and MGO. These materials are crucial in construction and public works, particularly for cladding and panelling applications where thermal resistance is paramount. The jurisprudence surrounding these materials often involves issues of materiality and compliance, with clients alleging breaches of standards that could undermine structural integrity. The thickness and bonding properties of these materials must be predictable and chemically stable to avoid impractical outcomes. Effective mediation and argumentation in disputes are essential to ensure that the veracity of claims is upheld, thereby strengthening the regulatory framework governing their use.",
