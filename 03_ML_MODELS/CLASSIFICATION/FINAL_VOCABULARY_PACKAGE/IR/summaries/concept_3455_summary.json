  "summary": "Arms limitation refers to the regulatory frameworks aimed at controlling the stockpile and use of firearms, explosives, and ammunition to enhance international security. The EU actively pursues disarmament initiatives, emphasising the need for effective demobilisation and rehabilitation of combatants. Through various fora, including the ICRC and UNDP, the EU engages in programs that address the destabilising effects of arms caches and landmines, particularly in conflict-affected regions like Timor and Cambodia. By training instructors and parliamentarians, the EU aims to influence policies that drive arms limitation, appealing for cooperation among member states to mitigate insecurity and promote sustainable peace.",
