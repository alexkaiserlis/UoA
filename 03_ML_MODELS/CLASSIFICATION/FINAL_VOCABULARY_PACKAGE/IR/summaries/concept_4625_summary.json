  "summary": "Usufruct is a legal concept within civil law, particularly relevant in the context of property rights in the EU. It grants an individual (the usufructuary) the right to use and enjoy the benefits of a property owned by another (the bare owner), while preserving the property's substance. This arrangement allows for the enjoyment of fruits—both natural and civil—derived from the property, such as rental income or agricultural produce. Usufruct is significant in various legal frameworks across EU member states, influencing inheritance laws, property transactions, and the management of assets, thereby facilitating a balance between ownership and use rights.",
