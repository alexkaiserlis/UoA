  "summary": "The term \"manuscript\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory documentation refers to a written document that is typically drafted by hand or typed, serving as a preliminary version of a formal text. Manuscripts are crucial in the legislative process, as they often contain original proposals, amendments, or reports that inform subsequent official documents. In the EU framework, manuscripts may undergo various revisions before being adopted as final texts, highlighting their role in the iterative nature of legal drafting. While not frequently referenced in contemporary discourse, understanding manuscripts is essential for comprehending the evolution of legal texts within EU institutions.",
