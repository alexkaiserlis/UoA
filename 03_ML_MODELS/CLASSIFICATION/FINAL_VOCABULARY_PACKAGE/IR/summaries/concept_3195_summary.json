  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"intermediate goods\" refer to products that are utilized in the production process of final goods but are not themselves final consumer products. These goods play a crucial role in the supply chain, facilitating the transformation of raw materials into finished items. The regulatory treatment of intermediate goods is significant for trade policies, customs duties, and value-added tax (VAT) considerations within the EU single market. Understanding the classification and treatment of intermediate goods is essential for compliance with EU regulations, ensuring efficient economic operations and fostering competitive market conditions.",
