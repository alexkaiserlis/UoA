  "summary": "Energy cooperation within the European Union represents a permanent framework established to enhance regional energy security and efficiency. This cooperation is supported by commitments from member states, requiring them to engage in ministerial meetings and discussions that closely follow developments in the energy field. The policy aims to extend the duration of collaborative efforts, ensuring that decisions are entered into force according to the treaties of the community. High-level meetings, concluded in official journals, outline the entry of new agreements and the extension of existing ones, thereby fostering a unified approach to energy challenges across the Union.",
