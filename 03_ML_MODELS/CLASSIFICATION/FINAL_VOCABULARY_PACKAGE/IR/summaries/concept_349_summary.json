  "summary": "A \"decision of the European Parliament\" refers to a formal act adopted by the Parliament that holds binding legal force within the European Union. This concept is often redirected to the preferred term \"decision (EU),\" which encompasses various types of decisions made by EU institutions. Such decisions are crucial in shaping EU law and policy, as they can address specific issues, set regulatory frameworks, or provide guidance on legislative matters. The legal implications of these decisions are significant, as they contribute to the harmonization of laws across member states, ensuring compliance with EU standards and promoting the rule of law within the Union.",
