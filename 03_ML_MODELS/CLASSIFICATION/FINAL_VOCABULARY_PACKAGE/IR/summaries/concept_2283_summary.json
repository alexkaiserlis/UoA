  "summary": "The \"flag of convenience\" refers to a practice in maritime transport where shipowners register their vessels under a foreign flag, typically in countries with lenient regulations and lower operational costs. This practice can lead to regulatory challenges within the EU, as it may undermine safety, labor standards, and environmental protections established by EU law. The European Union has sought to address these issues through various directives aimed at ensuring compliance with maritime safety and labor regulations. By scrutinizing flags of convenience, the EU aims to enhance accountability and promote fair competition in the maritime sector, safeguarding both workers' rights and environmental standards.",
