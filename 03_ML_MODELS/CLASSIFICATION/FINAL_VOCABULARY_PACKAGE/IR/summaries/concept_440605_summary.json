  "summary": "A \"delegated decision\" in the context of European Union law refers to a specific type of legislative act that allows the European Commission to adopt non-legislative acts, which supplement or amend existing legislation. This mechanism is established under Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Delegated decisions enable the Commission to address technical details or adapt legislation to evolving circumstances without undergoing the full legislative procedure. This ensures efficiency and responsiveness in EU regulatory frameworks, while maintaining oversight by the European Parliament and the Council, which can revoke or object to such decisions.",
