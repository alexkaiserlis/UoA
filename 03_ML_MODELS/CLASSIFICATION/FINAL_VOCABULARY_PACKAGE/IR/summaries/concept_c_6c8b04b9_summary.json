  "summary": "Energy auditing, commonly referred to as \"energy audit,\" is a critical component of the EU's energy policy framework. It involves a systematic assessment of energy consumption in buildings and industrial processes to identify opportunities for improving energy efficiency. The legal basis for energy audits is established under the Energy Efficiency Directive (2012/27/EU), which mandates that large enterprises conduct regular energy audits to comply with EU regulations. These audits not only contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions but also support the EU's broader objectives of sustainable development and energy transition. As a redirect, \"energy auditing\" is synonymous with \"energy audit,\" emphasizing its importance in regulatory compliance and energy management strategies within the EU.",
