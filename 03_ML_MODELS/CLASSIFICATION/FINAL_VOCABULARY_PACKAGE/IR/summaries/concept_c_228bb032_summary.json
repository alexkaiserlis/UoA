  "summary": "The concept of \"alternatives to animal testing\" encompasses various methodologies aimed at reducing or replacing the use of animals in scientific research and testing within the EU. This regulatory framework is critical in promoting ethical standards and advancing scientific innovation. The EU has established directives and regulations, such as the REACH Regulation and the Cosmetics Regulation, which encourage the development and validation of alternative methods, including in vitro techniques and computer modeling. These alternatives not only align with the EU's commitment to animal welfare but also enhance research efficiency and reliability, fostering a more sustainable approach to scientific inquiry.",
