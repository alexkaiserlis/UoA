  "summary": "A \"hunger strike\" is a form of non-violent protest where individuals refuse to eat to draw attention to political or social issues. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, hunger strikes may intersect with human rights considerations, particularly regarding the treatment of detainees and the right to peaceful assembly. The EU emphasizes the importance of safeguarding public safety while respecting individual freedoms. Legal implications arise when hunger strikes occur in detention facilities, necessitating a balance between maintaining order and addressing the humanitarian concerns of individuals exercising their rights. This phenomenon highlights the complex interplay between politics, public safety, and human rights within the EU.",
