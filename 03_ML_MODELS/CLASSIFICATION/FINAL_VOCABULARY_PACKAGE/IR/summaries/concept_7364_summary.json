  "summary": "The term \"incunabula\" refers to books printed before 1501, representing a pivotal phase in the history of documentation and publishing. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, incunabula are significant for their historical value and the insights they provide into early legal texts and regulatory practices. These early printed works can inform contemporary interpretations of legal principles and the evolution of documentation standards. While the term is not commonly encountered in modern legal discourse, its relevance persists in discussions about the preservation of cultural heritage and the accessibility of historical legal documents within EU member states.",
