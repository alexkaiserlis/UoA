  "summary": "The concept of \"lifelong learning,\" redirected to \"continuing education,\" is integral to EU legal and regulatory frameworks aimed at enhancing the skills of learners throughout their careers. This approach fosters creativity and entrepreneurial talent, particularly in professions requiring adaptability. Programs like Leonardo and Socrates strategically cater to diverse educational needs, promoting a responsive and interactive learning environment. By disseminating knowledge and boosting the attractiveness of tertiary education, the EU aims to drive interdependence among skilled individuals. Such initiatives undoubtedly enhance the prestige of educational institutions, ensuring that everyone, including girls, can harness their potential and thrive in a rapidly evolving job market.",
