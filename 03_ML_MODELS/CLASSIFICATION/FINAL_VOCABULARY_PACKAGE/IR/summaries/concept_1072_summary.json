  "summary": "The concept of \"pricing mechanism,\" redirected to \"price formation,\" plays a crucial role in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning the logistics and transport sectors. It encompasses various aspects of pricing strategies employed by carriers, shippers, and forwarding agents, which are vital for the carriage of goods across inland waterways and rail networks. The pricing mechanism is influenced by factors such as distance, saturation, and the behaviour of market participants. It aims to ensure comparability and uniformity in pricing, facilitating the liberalization of transport services. This regulatory approach foresees the need for timely adjustments, compensating for unused capacity and optimizing logistical operations.",
