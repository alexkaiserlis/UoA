  "summary": "The \"electoral deposit\" is a financial requirement mandated in certain electoral procedures within the European Union. It serves as a safeguard against frivolous candidacies, ensuring that candidates demonstrate a serious commitment to the electoral process. Typically, candidates must submit a monetary deposit, which is forfeited if they fail to secure a specified percentage of the vote. This mechanism not only promotes accountability but also enhances the integrity of the voting system. The electoral deposit is a critical element in the regulatory framework governing elections, reflecting the EU's commitment to democratic principles and robust electoral standards.",
