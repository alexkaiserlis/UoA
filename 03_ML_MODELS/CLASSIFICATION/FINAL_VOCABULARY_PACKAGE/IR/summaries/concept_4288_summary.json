  "summary": "The concept of \"private stock\" within the EU regulatory framework refers to the management of goods held by private entities, particularly in distributive trades. This stock can become subject to difficulties, such as imbalances in supply and demand, necessitating planned destocking to improve market conditions. In regions like Meulebeke and Ardooie, stakeholders may remarket their private stock to mitigate losses and address foreseeable challenges. The integration of private stock management into agricultural markets is crucial, as it allows for calculated interventions that can stabilize prices. Moreover, the regulation of private stock is essential for ensuring that the market remains appropriate and responsive to local needs, such as those in Lichtervelde and Zwevezele.",
