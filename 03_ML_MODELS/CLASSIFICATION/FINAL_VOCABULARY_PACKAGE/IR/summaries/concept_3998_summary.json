  "summary": "The concept of \"extra-atmospheric space\" pertains to the legal framework governing outer space, a domain characterised by multilateralism and international cooperation. The EU acknowledges the implications of expanding space activities, which pose both challenges and threats to peace and security. Key actors, including member states, are mandated to discuss and endorse regulations that ensure the preservation of this resource. The emphasis on interoperability and capability enhancement is crucial for addressing debris and other detrimental factors. The Vienna Convention and other charters inspire the EU's goal of fostering confidence among nations, while the assembly of stakeholders is vital for executing effective strategies in this wider context.",
