  "summary": "The principle of subsidiarity is a fundamental concept in EU law, establishing that decisions should be made at the closest possible level to the citizens, unless a higher scale of governance justifies intervention. This principle ensures that the EU only acts when objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States alone, promoting greater efficiency and cohesion. Legislative measures must consider the eligibility of actions, types of expenditure, and the design of programmes. Simplifications in administration, such as reimbursement processes and eligibility criteria, are recommended to enhance certainty and effectiveness. The principle underpins the distribution of funds, ensuring that grants are linked to real needs and that exceptions are carefully justified.",
