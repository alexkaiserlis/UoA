  "summary": "The concept of \"public gardens,\" categorized under construction and town planning, is redirected to the preferred term \"green area.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, green areas are essential for urban sustainability, promoting biodiversity, and enhancing the quality of life for residents. They serve as vital spaces for recreation, social interaction, and environmental education. EU directives often emphasize the importance of integrating green areas into urban planning to mitigate urban heat islands and improve air quality. The designation of public gardens as green areas underscores their role in fostering ecological balance within urban environments.",
