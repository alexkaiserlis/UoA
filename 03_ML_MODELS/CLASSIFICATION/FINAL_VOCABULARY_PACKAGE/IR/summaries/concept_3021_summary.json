  "summary": "\"Pay television\" refers to a broadcasting model wherein viewers access audiovisual content through encrypted signals, typically via subscription. In the EU regulatory framework, this concept is enshrined to ensure pluralism and protect minors from inappropriate content. Providers must adhere to thoroughness in encoding and functionality of their services, utilizing technologies such as set-top boxes (sstbs) and proprietary electronics. Regulatory measures include sanctions for breaches, ensuring dissuasive remedies against infringing activities. The EU pursues a balanced scenario that addresses disparities in access while yielding benchmarks for quality. This framework aims to protect consumers, who may be unaware of potential damages from misleading broadcasts.",
