  "summary": "The \"system of land ownership,\" also referred to as the \"landholding system,\" encompasses the legal frameworks governing the distribution, use, and management of land within the EU. This concept is pivotal in shaping agricultural policies and ensuring sustainable farming systems. The regulatory context involves various directives and regulations that address land tenure, property rights, and environmental stewardship. Understanding the landholding system is essential for compliance with EU agricultural regulations, which aim to promote equitable access to land, enhance productivity, and support rural development. The term \"landholding system\" is preferred for its specificity in legal discourse, encapsulating the complexities of land ownership structures across member states.",
