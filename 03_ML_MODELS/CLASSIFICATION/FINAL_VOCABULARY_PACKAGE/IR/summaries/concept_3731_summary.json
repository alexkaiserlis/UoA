  "summary": "The term \"nuclear programme,\" redirected to \"nuclear policy,\" encompasses the EU's strategic framework for the development and management of nuclear energy, which is considered an inexhaustible and benign source of power. The EU's nuclear policy embraces a quadripartite approach, promoting cooperation among member states in areas such as reactor safety and environmental sustainability. Initiatives like the ITER project focus on thermonuclear fusion, utilizing advanced technologies such as tokamaks and stellarators to achieve energy confinement. The JRC plays a pivotal role in the reassessment of nuclear technologies, ensuring that financial and environmental impacts are mutually beneficial. This policy also addresses the mobility of nuclear materials and the implications of Iranian nuclear activities, fostering a comprehensive and environmentally oriented framework for future energy needs.",
