  "summary": "Fresh cheese, categorized under processed agricultural produce (6016), encompasses a variety of dairy products, including requeijão and ricotta, which are subject to specific EU regulations. The designation of these products often involves PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) status, stipulating that they must meet rigorous standards. The regulatory framework seeks to protect names like \"pouligny\" and \"baixa,\" ensuring they are not misused. Additives and treatments applied to fresh cheese must be clearly indicated, and any objections to these specifications can be formally registered. The holder of a PDO designation must comply with binding regulations, which are interpreted by the chairman of the relevant committee. This ensures that the integrity of these foodstuffs is maintained, allowing for minor subdivisions while protecting the wholly unique characteristics of each cheese.",
