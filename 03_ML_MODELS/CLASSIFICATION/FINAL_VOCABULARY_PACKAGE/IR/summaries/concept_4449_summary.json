  "summary": "In EU parliamentary proceedings, a \"request for an opinion\" serves as a consultative mechanism where various stakeholders, including judges, lawyers, and unions, can advocate for specific positions on legislative dossiers. This process is crucial for ensuring the suitability and independence of candidates appointed to key positions, such as governors or judges. By fostering dialogue among involved parties, the opinion mechanism aims to reinforce democratic principles and enhance the accessibility of legal frameworks. The president of the relevant panel exercises care in considering these requests, which can significantly impact the success and sustainability of EU policies, particularly in extreme or sensitive contexts.",
