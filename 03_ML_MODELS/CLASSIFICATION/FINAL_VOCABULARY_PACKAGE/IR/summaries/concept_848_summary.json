  "summary": "The concept of \"vehicle parts\" encompasses a wide range of components essential for the operation and safety of vehicles within the EU regulatory framework. This includes items such as backrests, flywheels, and alternators, which are crucial for vehicle functionality. Regulatory bodies classify these parts, ensuring compliance with safety standards, such as those governing defrosters and wiperblades. The categorization of vehicle parts also involves considerations of conspicuity and drag, impacting design and performance. Manufacturers, including major players like Valeo and Denso, must adhere to stringent authorization processes, addressing obstructions and ensuring that components like speedometers and oscillating systems meet EU specifications.",
