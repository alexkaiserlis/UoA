  "summary": "Migration statistics are critical in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, serving as essential data for understanding demographic shifts and population dynamics within member states. These statistics encompass various aspects of migration, including inflows, outflows, and the characteristics of migrants. They inform policy decisions, facilitate the implementation of the Common European Asylum System, and support compliance with international obligations. Accurate migration statistics are vital for assessing the impact of migration on social cohesion, labor markets, and public services, thereby enabling the EU to formulate evidence-based strategies to manage migration effectively and uphold the rights of individuals involved.",
