  "summary": "Administrative transparency within the EU legal framework refers to the formalisation of processes that ensure public access to information regarding executive power and public service operations. This concept underpins the principles of accountability and integrity, enabling stakeholders, including lobbyists and citizens, to consult relevant data. By publishing anonymised summaries of decision-making processes, the EU aims to minimise prejudices and enhance trust among addressees. The collegial approach to governance, where departments collaboratively address issues, substantiates the necessity for transparency. Furthermore, the economic implications of transparency are profound, as it fosters a sincere relationship between the state and its proprietors, ultimately supporting democratic fundamentals.",
