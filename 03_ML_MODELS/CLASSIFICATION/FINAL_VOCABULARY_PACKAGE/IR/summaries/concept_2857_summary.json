  "summary": "The concept of \"work psychology,\" redirected to \"occupational psychology,\" pertains to the study of human behavior in professional settings, focusing on enhancing the organisation of work and working conditions. Within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, occupational psychology plays a crucial role in shaping policies that promote employee well-being, productivity, and safety. It informs directives related to workplace health, stress management, and the psychological aspects of work environments. By integrating insights from occupational psychology, EU institutions aim to foster a more effective and supportive work culture, ultimately contributing to improved labour standards and compliance across member states.",
