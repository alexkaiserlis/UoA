The European Medicines Agency (EMA) plays a pivotal role in the regulatory landscape, facilitating the harmonization of pharmacy practices across member states. Additionally, directives related to the distribution and sale of pharmaceuticals are integral to maintaining a robust healthcare system, safeguarding both patients and healthcare professionals.",
