  "summary": "The concept of \"performance drugs\" pertains to substances used to enhance athletic performance, often associated with doping in sports. Within the EU regulatory framework, performance drugs are subject to stringent controls under various legal instruments aimed at safeguarding public health and ensuring fair competition. The European Commission, alongside national authorities, implements measures to combat the misuse of these substances, which can pose significant health risks and undermine the integrity of sports. The regulation of performance drugs falls under broader social affairs policies, reflecting the EU's commitment to promoting ethical standards in athletics and protecting athletes' welfare.",
