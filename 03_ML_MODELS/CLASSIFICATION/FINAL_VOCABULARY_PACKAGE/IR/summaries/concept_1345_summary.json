  "summary": "The concept of \"economic resilience,\" redirected to \"economic independence,\" is pivotal in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly within international affairs. Economic independence refers to the capacity of EU member states to withstand external shocks and maintain stability without excessive reliance on foreign entities. This concept underpins various EU policies aimed at enhancing self-sufficiency, fostering sustainable growth, and ensuring robust supply chains. By promoting economic independence, the EU seeks to mitigate vulnerabilities and enhance collective security, thereby reinforcing its geopolitical standing. This strategic focus is essential for developing a cohesive approach to economic governance and international cooperation.",
