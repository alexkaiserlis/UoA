  "summary": "The concept of \"stock-exchange listing\" pertains to the regulatory framework governing the admission of equities to trading on a stock exchange, facilitating the free movement of capital within the EU. This process involves the preparation of prospectuses that adhere to IAS and IFRS standards, ensuring full disclosures regarding the offerorâ€™s financials and indebtedness. The listing process may include restating financial statements to align with GAAP or IASB guidelines, thereby enhancing transparency. Advertisements and narratives must be carefully crafted to avoid hostile interpretations. Ultimately, a successful listing can lead to increased capitalisation and investor confidence in industrials and utilities sectors, promoting a converging financial landscape across member states.",
