  "summary": "Whistleblowing refers to the act of reporting illicit or unethical activities within organizations, particularly in the public sector. In the EU legal framework, whistleblowing is crucial for promoting transparency and accountability, thereby enhancing public safety and trust in governance. The EU has established directives to protect whistleblowers from retaliation, ensuring they can disclose information without fear of adverse consequences. This regulatory approach aims to foster a culture of integrity and vigilance against corruption, ultimately contributing to the overall efficacy of political institutions and public safety mechanisms across member states.",
