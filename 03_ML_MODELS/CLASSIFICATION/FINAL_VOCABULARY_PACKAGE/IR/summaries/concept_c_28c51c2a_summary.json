  "summary": "Rail safety is a critical aspect of transport policy within the European Union, governed by a comprehensive legal framework aimed at ensuring the safe operation of rail networks. This concept encompasses regulations that establish safety standards, risk assessment protocols, and compliance mechanisms for railway operators. The EU promotes harmonization of safety measures across member states, facilitating cross-border rail services while minimizing risks to passengers and freight. Key legislative instruments, such as the Railway Safety Directive, outline obligations for safety management systems and incident reporting, thereby enhancing overall rail safety and fostering public confidence in rail transport systems across Europe.",
