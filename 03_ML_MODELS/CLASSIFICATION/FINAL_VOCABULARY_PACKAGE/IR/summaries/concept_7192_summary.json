  "summary": "The Inter-American Court of Human Rights is a pivotal judicial body established to uphold and interpret the American Convention on Human Rights. While primarily focused on the Americas, its legal precedents and rulings can influence EU legal frameworks, particularly in areas concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Court's jurisprudence may serve as a comparative reference for EU institutions when addressing similar human rights issues, fostering a dialogue between extra-European organisations and EU legal standards. This interaction underscores the importance of international human rights law in shaping regulatory practices within the EU, promoting a cohesive approach to human rights protection globally.",
