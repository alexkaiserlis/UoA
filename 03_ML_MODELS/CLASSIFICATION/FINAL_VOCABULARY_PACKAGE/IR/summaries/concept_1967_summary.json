  "summary": "Universalism, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the principle that certain rights and values are universally applicable, transcending national boundaries. This concept underpins various EU policies aimed at promoting human rights, democracy, and the rule of law across member states. Universalism advocates for the equal treatment of individuals, ensuring that all citizens benefit from the same legal protections and obligations. It serves as a foundational element in the EU's approach to external relations, influencing agreements and treaties that seek to uphold these universal values globally. Thus, universalism is integral to the EU's identity and legal coherence.",
