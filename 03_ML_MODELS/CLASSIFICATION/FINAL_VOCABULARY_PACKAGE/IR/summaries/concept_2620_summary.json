  "summary": "The \"slaughter premium\" is a financial incentive established within EU agricultural regulations, aimed at supporting livestock farmers during periods of market volatility. This premium is particularly relevant for heifers and lambmeat, as it addresses the seasonalization of production and helps mitigate the swamping of markets with culled animals. By offering a premium, the EU seeks to affirm respect for rural economies and facilitate a transitionally sustainable agricultural structure. However, the system is not without challenges, including potential clawback provisions for fraudulently claimed premiums. The unfolding complexities of this regulation necessitate careful adaptation to ensure equitable support across diverse comarcas, particularly in regions like Lérida and Toledo, where agricultural practices vary significantly.",
