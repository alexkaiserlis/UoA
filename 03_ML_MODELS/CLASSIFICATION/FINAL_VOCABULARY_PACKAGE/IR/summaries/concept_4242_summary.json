  "summary": "\"Voluntary restraint\" refers to a practice within EU competition law where firms voluntarily limit their production or sales to avoid market saturation or price competition. This self-imposed limitation can serve as a strategic tool to maintain market stability and profitability. While such practices may be seen as a form of collusion, they are not inherently illegal unless they significantly distort competition or harm consumer welfare. The European Commission monitors these arrangements to ensure compliance with Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which prohibits anti-competitive agreements. Thus, voluntary restraint must be carefully assessed within the regulatory framework.",
