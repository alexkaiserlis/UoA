  "summary": "The term \"aircraft fleet\" refers to the collective group of aircraft operated by an airline or aviation entity, which is crucial in the context of EU air transport regulations. The European Union has established comprehensive legal frameworks governing the operation, safety, and environmental impact of aircraft fleets. These regulations ensure compliance with safety standards, promote competition, and facilitate the efficient management of air traffic. Additionally, the EU's Single European Sky initiative aims to optimize airspace usage, thereby enhancing the operational efficiency of aircraft fleets across member states. Understanding this concept is essential for stakeholders in the aviation sector to navigate EU regulatory requirements effectively.",
