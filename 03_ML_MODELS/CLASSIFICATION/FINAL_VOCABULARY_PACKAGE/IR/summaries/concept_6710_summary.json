  "summary": "The \"pre-accession strategy\" is a crucial framework within EU legal and regulatory contexts aimed at preparing candidate countries, such as Albania, for eventual membership. This strategy encompasses various instruments, including the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA), which supports the finalisation of reforms necessary for EU integration. It promotes sectorial partnerships and decentralised governance, enhancing the readiness of candidate nations through accredited practices and accreditations. The strategy also emphasizes the importance of democracy, minority rights, and the conferral of EU standards. By executing these measures, the EU aims to upgrade institutional capacities and ensure that candidates are equipped to meet communautaire obligations, thereby facilitating a smoother accession process.",
