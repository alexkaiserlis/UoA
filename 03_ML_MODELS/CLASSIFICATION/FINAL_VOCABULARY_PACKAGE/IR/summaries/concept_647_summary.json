  "summary": "A \"subsistence economy\" refers to an economic structure where communities primarily produce goods and services for their own consumption, rather than for trade or profit. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is significant as it intersects with policies on rural development, sustainability, and food security. The EU recognizes the importance of subsistence economies in preserving cultural heritage and promoting biodiversity. Regulatory measures may support these economies through initiatives aimed at enhancing local agricultural practices and ensuring access to resources, thereby fostering resilience in rural areas and contributing to the overall socio-economic stability within the EU.",
