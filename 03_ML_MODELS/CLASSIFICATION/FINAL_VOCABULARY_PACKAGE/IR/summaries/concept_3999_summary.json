  "summary": "The concept of \"space property right\" pertains to the legal frameworks governing ownership and use of resources in outer space, as articulated within international law. In the context of EU regulatory documents, it addresses the complexities of property rights concerning celestial bodies and the implications for commercial activities, such as mining and satellite deployment. The EU emphasizes adherence to international treaties, notably the Outer Space Treaty, which asserts that outer space is not subject to national appropriation. As commercial interests in space expand, the EU is actively exploring regulatory measures to ensure sustainable and equitable use of space resources while balancing national and international interests.",
