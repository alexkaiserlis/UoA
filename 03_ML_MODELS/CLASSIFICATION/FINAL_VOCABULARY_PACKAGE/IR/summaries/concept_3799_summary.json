  "summary": "Western Sahara is a disputed territory located in North Africa, with significant implications for international law and EU regulatory frameworks. The region's status remains unresolved, as it is claimed by both the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and Morocco. The EU's legal stance emphasizes the importance of self-determination for the Sahrawi people, aligning with principles of international law. The EU has engaged in various diplomatic efforts to facilitate negotiations, reflecting its commitment to peace and stability in the region. Additionally, the EU's trade agreements with Morocco have raised concerns regarding the inclusion of Western Sahara, necessitating careful legal scrutiny to ensure compliance with international obligations.",
