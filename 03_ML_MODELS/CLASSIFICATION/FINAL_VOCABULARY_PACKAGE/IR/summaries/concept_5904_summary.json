  "summary": "The term \"budgetary stabiliser\" refers to mechanisms within the EU's financial framework designed to mitigate economic fluctuations and ensure fiscal stability. These stabilisers automatically adjust government revenues and expenditures in response to changing economic conditions, thereby promoting counter-cyclical fiscal policies. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, budgetary stabilisers play a crucial role in maintaining compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact, which aims to prevent excessive budget deficits and public debt. This concept is pivotal for fostering economic resilience and sustainable growth across member states, ensuring that fiscal policies remain adaptable to varying economic circumstances.",
