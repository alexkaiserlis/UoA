  "summary": "The \"distribution of income\" concept within the context of EU national accounts refers to the systematic allocation of income among various sectors of the economy, including households, businesses, and the government. This distribution is crucial for understanding economic performance and social equity, as it influences consumption patterns and investment decisions. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, accurate measurement and reporting of income distribution are essential for policy formulation, particularly in areas such as taxation, social welfare, and economic cohesion. By analyzing income distribution, EU institutions can assess the impact of economic policies and ensure compliance with principles of fairness and sustainability.",
