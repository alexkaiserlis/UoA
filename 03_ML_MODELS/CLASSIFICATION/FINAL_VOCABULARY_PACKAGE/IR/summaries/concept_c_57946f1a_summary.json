  "summary": "The concept of \"religious symbol\" pertains to the intersection of culture and religion within EU legal frameworks. In regulatory contexts, religious symbols are often examined concerning freedom of expression, anti-discrimination laws, and the secular nature of public institutions. The EU promotes respect for diverse religious expressions while balancing these rights against principles of equality and non-discrimination. Legal documents may address the display of religious symbols in public spaces, workplace policies, and educational environments, reflecting the EU's commitment to cultural pluralism and social cohesion. This concept is crucial for understanding the legal implications of religious representation in a multicultural Europe.",
