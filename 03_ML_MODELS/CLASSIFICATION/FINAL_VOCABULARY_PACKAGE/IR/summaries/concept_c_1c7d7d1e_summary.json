  "summary": "The \"care economy\" encompasses the range of services and activities related to the provision of care, particularly in the context of social protection within the European Union. This concept is integral to EU legal and regulatory frameworks, as it addresses the growing demand for care services due to demographic changes, such as an aging population. The care economy includes formal and informal caregiving, highlighting the need for policies that ensure adequate support, funding, and recognition of care work. By integrating the care economy into social protection strategies, the EU aims to enhance the quality of life for individuals and promote gender equality in caregiving roles.",
