  "summary": "Profit sharing, within the context of EU labour law and labour relations, refers to a regulatory framework that allows employees to receive a portion of a company's profits, thereby fostering a sense of ownership and incentivizing productivity. This concept is often integrated into collective agreements or individual employment contracts, promoting equitable distribution of wealth generated by the enterprise. The EU encourages profit sharing as a mechanism to enhance employee engagement and social dialogue, aligning with broader objectives of sustainable economic growth and social cohesion. Legal provisions surrounding profit sharing vary across member states, reflecting diverse approaches to labour relations and corporate governance.",
