  "summary": "The concept of \"presidential r?gime\" pertains to a political framework characterized by a system where a president holds significant executive authority, often in contrast to parliamentary systems. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, this regime influences the governance structures of member states, particularly those with a strong presidential system. Such frameworks can affect the distribution of powers, the legislative process, and the relationship between the executive and legislative branches. Understanding the implications of a presidential r?gime is crucial for analyzing compliance with EU principles of democracy and rule of law, as well as for assessing member states' adherence to EU regulations.",
