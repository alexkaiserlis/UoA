  "summary": "The \"right of pre-emption\" is a legal concept within civil law that grants a party the preferential right to purchase property or assets before they are offered to third parties. In the context of EU regulations, this right is often embedded in various legal frameworks to protect stakeholders, particularly in real estate and contractual agreements. It serves to ensure that certain entities, such as tenants or co-owners, have the opportunity to acquire interests before external buyers, thereby promoting fairness and stability in property transactions. The right of pre-emption is an essential tool in safeguarding the rights of individuals and entities within the EU legal landscape.",
