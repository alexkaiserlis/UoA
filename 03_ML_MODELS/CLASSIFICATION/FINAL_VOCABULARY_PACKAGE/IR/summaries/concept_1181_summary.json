  "summary": "The concept of \"free medical care\" within the EU legal framework refers to the provision of healthcare services without direct charges to patients, ensuring equitable access to essential health services across member states. This principle is underpinned by various EU regulations and directives aimed at safeguarding public health and promoting the right to health. The EU's commitment to free medical care aligns with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which emphasizes the right to access healthcare. Additionally, it encompasses cross-border healthcare provisions, allowing EU citizens to seek medical treatment in other member states, thereby enhancing health mobility and cooperation among nations.",
