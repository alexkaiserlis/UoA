  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the term \"prime minister\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"head of government.\" This designation refers to the individual who holds the highest executive authority within a government, responsible for the administration of public policy and the execution of laws. The head of government plays a crucial role in the formulation of national legislation and represents the state in international affairs. Within the EU, heads of government convene in the European Council to shape collective policy decisions, thereby influencing the broader landscape of executive power and public service across member states.",
