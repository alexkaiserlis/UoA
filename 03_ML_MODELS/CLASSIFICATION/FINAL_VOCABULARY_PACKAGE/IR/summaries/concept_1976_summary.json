  "summary": "Unicameralism, often referred to as a \"unicameral system,\" denotes a legislative structure in which a single chamber holds the authority to enact laws. This concept is significant in the context of EU legal frameworks, as it contrasts with bicameral systems, where two chambers share legislative responsibilities. Unicameral parliaments can streamline the legislative process, potentially enhancing efficiency in law-making and governance. While unicameralism is less common in EU member states, it is essential for understanding various national legislative practices and their implications for EU regulatory alignment. This summary serves as a redirect to the preferred term, emphasizing its relevance in parliamentary discussions.",
