  "summary": "The concept of \"secondary journal\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory documentation refers to a bibliographic resource that compiles supplementary materials relevant to legislative and regulatory texts. As a redirect to the preferred term \"bibliography,\" it underscores the importance of comprehensive documentation in the EUâ€™s legal framework. Secondary journals serve as critical tools for researchers, policymakers, and legal professionals, facilitating access to a wide array of references that enhance understanding of primary legal texts. By providing context and additional insights, these bibliographic resources play a vital role in the interpretation and application of EU law.",
