  "summary": "The \"marriage rate\" is a demographic indicator reflecting the frequency of marriages within a specified population over a defined period. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, understanding marriage rates is crucial for formulating policies related to family law, social welfare, and demographic studies. Variations in marriage rates can influence legislative measures concerning taxation, inheritance, and social security systems. Moreover, the marriage rate serves as a vital statistic for assessing societal trends, which can impact EU initiatives aimed at promoting family stability and cohesion. Consequently, this concept is integral to demographic analysis and policy development across member states.",
