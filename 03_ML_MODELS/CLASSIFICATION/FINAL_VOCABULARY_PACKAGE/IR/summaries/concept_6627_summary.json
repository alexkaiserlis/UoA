  "summary": "The concept of \"religious conflict\" pertains to disputes arising from differing religious beliefs, which can significantly impact the exercise of rights and freedoms within the EU. Such conflicts often challenge the principles of tolerance and coexistence enshrined in EU law, particularly in relation to the protection of minority rights. The EU's regulatory framework aims to mitigate religious conflicts by promoting dialogue, understanding, and respect among diverse religious communities. This is crucial for upholding fundamental rights, ensuring social cohesion, and fostering an inclusive environment where freedom of religion is respected and protected across member states.",
