  "summary": "The concept of \"sales network,\" categorized under distributive trades, is redirected to the preferred term \"distributive trades\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. This term encompasses various forms of cooperation among entities, such as pharmacists and suppliers, to ensure the efficient distribution of goods. Regulatory measures aim to prevent frauds and counterfeiting, particularly in sectors dealing with sensitive products, including pharmaceuticals and motorised equipment. The EU emphasizes the importance of equalisation and transparency in these networks, addressing issues like defective products and leakage of sensitive information. By liberalizing trade directions and enhancing the functionality of portals, the EU seeks to create a more integrated market, where inoperability is minimized and stakeholders can effectively navigate the complexities of distributive trades.",
