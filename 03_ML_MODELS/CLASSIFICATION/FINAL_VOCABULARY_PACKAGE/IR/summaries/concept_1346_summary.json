  "summary": "The concept of \"political independence,\" redirected to \"national independence,\" is pivotal in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning the sovereignty of member states and their territories. It underscores the integrity of nations, such as Ukraine and Eritrea, in their quest for autonomy against external threats. The EU's international agreements, including those with ACP countries, often involve provisions that prohibit actions undermining this independence. Political independence is essential for maintaining peace and stability, as it allows nations to communicate their demands and negotiate contracts without external interference. Thus, it remains a cornerstone of the EU's commitment to safeguarding the rights of independent entities across the Caribbean and Pacific regions.",
