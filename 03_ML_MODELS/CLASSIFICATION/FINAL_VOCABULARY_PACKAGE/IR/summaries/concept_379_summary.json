  "summary": "The \"resignation of the government\" refers to the formal process whereby a government relinquishes its authority, often triggered by political instability, loss of parliamentary support, or a significant policy failure. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such a resignation can lead to the dissolution of the governing body and the potential for new elections or the formation of a caretaker government. This process is crucial for maintaining democratic accountability and ensuring that governance aligns with the rule of law. The implications of a governmentâ€™s resignation extend to EU member states' compliance with EU regulations and their political stability, impacting broader EU governance.",
