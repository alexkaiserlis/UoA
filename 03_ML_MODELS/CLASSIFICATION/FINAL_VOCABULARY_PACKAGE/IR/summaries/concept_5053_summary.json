  "summary": "The concept of \"military budget\" is redirected to the preferred term \"defence budget\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. The defence budget encompasses the financial resources allocated by EU member states for military expenditures, including personnel, equipment, and operational costs. This budget is crucial for maintaining national security and fulfilling collective defence commitments under EU treaties. The regulation of the defence budget is subject to scrutiny to ensure compliance with EU principles, including transparency and accountability. By consolidating military spending under the term \"defence budget,\" the EU aims to foster coherence in defence policy and enhance collaborative security initiatives among member states.",
