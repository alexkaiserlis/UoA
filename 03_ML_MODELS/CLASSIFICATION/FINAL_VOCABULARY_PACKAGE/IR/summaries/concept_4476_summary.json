  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"tractor\" signifies a versatile means of agricultural production, essential for modern farming practices. Tractors are equipped with various attachments, such as loaders and PTO (Power Take-Off) systems, enhancing their functionality. The regulatory framework often includes directives that address safety features, including shielding and silencer requirements to minimize noise pollution. Manufacturers, like Hanomag and Komatsu, must comply with these standards to ensure their products are available across member states. The adoption of advanced technologies, such as ultrafine filtration systems, signifies a shift towards more sustainable agricultural practices, thereby equalizing the competitive landscape among producers.",
