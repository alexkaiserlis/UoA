  "summary": "The concept of \"measure having equivalent effect\" pertains to regulations within EU international trade law, aimed at preventing discrimination against imported goods. Such measures, often signed on during trade agreements, can arise from clauses that maintain a level playing field by eliminating quantitative restrictions and prohibitions affecting exports. The EU seeks to mitigate shortages in various fields, including the circulation of vegetable oils and fats, by proposing refined regulations that safeguard mutual relations with contracting parties like Norway and Switzerland. The abolition of barriers fosters unity in the market, facilitating the development of economies while ensuring the completion of trade objectives.",
