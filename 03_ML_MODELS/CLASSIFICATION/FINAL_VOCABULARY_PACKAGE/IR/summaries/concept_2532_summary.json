  "summary": "Coastal pollution refers to the degradation of marine and coastal environments due to various anthropogenic activities, including industrial discharges, agricultural runoff, and maritime transport. Within the EU regulatory framework, coastal pollution is addressed through directives aimed at the protection of marine waters, such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) and the Water Framework Directive (WFD). These legal instruments establish standards for water quality and promote measures to prevent and mitigate pollution. The EU's commitment to sustainable development necessitates rigorous monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to combat coastal pollution, ensuring the preservation of biodiversity and the health of coastal ecosystems.",
