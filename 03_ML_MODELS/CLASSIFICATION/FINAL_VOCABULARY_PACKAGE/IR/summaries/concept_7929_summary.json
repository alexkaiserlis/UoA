  "summary": "Judicial review in the context of EU law refers to the process by which courts examine the legality of actions taken by EU institutions, ensuring compliance with legal norms and principles. This mechanism serves as a critical check on the exercise of power, allowing individuals and member states to challenge decisions that may infringe upon their rights or violate EU law. Judicial review is essential for upholding the rule of law and maintaining the integrity of the legal order within the EU. It reinforces accountability and transparency, enabling a robust legal framework that supports the protection of fundamental rights and democratic values.",
