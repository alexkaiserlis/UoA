  "summary": "Shale gas refers to natural gas extracted from shale formations, a process that has significant implications for the oil industry within the European Union. The extraction of shale gas, primarily through hydraulic fracturing or \"fracking,\" raises various legal and regulatory challenges, including environmental protection, public health, and energy security. EU legislation, such as the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, governs the assessment of potential impacts associated with shale gas projects. Member States are tasked with balancing energy needs and environmental sustainability, leading to divergent regulatory approaches across the EU. The ongoing debate reflects broader concerns about fossil fuel dependency and climate change commitments.",
