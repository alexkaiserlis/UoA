  "summary": "The concept of \"terrestrial ecosystem\" encompasses the intricate interactions among flora, fauna, and abiotic components within land-based environments. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, understanding terrestrial ecosystems is crucial for biodiversity conservation, sustainable land use, and environmental protection initiatives. The EU's Natura 2000 network, for instance, aims to safeguard habitats and species within these ecosystems, ensuring ecological balance and resilience. Regulatory measures, such as the Habitats Directive, mandate member states to assess and mitigate impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, thereby promoting sustainable practices and compliance with environmental standards. This concept is foundational for advancing EU environmental policies.",
