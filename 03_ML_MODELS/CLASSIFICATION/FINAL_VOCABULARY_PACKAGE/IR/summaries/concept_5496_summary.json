  "summary": "The \"civil code\" is a fundamental legal instrument within the EU's regulatory framework, serving as a comprehensive source of private law. It codifies principles governing civil rights and obligations, including contracts, property, and family law. Each EU member state may have its own civil code, reflecting national legal traditions while adhering to overarching EU directives. The harmonization of civil codes across member states is essential for facilitating cross-border legal transactions and ensuring legal certainty. This concept underscores the importance of codification in the development of coherent legal systems, promoting uniformity and predictability in civil law across the European Union.",
