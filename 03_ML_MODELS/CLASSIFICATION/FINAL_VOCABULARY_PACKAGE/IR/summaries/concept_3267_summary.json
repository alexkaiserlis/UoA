  "summary": "The concept of \"remission of export duties\" pertains to the legal framework governing trade policy within the European Union. It refers to the reduction or elimination of duties imposed on goods exported from EU member states. This regulatory mechanism aims to enhance competitiveness in international markets by alleviating financial burdens on exporters. The remission of export duties is particularly relevant in contexts where goods are subject to high tariffs, thereby facilitating smoother trade flows and compliance with international obligations. Such measures are integral to the EU's broader trade policy objectives, promoting economic growth and fostering global trade relationships.",
