  "summary": "\"Herd conversion\" refers to the process of transforming livestock production systems, particularly in the context of EU agricultural regulations. This concept is crucial for ensuring compliance with EU standards on animal welfare, food safety, and environmental sustainability. Herd conversion may involve changing the breed, management practices, or production methods of livestock to enhance productivity or meet specific regulatory requirements. The EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) supports such transitions through various funding mechanisms and guidelines, aimed at promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Understanding herd conversion is essential for stakeholders in the agricultural sector to navigate the complex legal landscape of EU agricultural structures and production.",
