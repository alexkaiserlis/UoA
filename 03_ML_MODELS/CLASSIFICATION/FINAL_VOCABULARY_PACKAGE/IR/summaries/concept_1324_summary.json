  "summary": "Inheritance tax, often referred to as \"capital transfer tax,\" is a significant aspect of taxation within the EU legal framework. This tax is levied on the transfer of assets upon an individual's death, impacting the beneficiaries of the estate. While the EU does not harmonize inheritance tax laws, it influences member states' regulations through directives and recommendations aimed at ensuring fair taxation practices. The term \"capital transfer tax\" serves as a preferred nomenclature, reflecting the broader scope of taxes applied to asset transfers. Understanding the nuances of inheritance tax is crucial for compliance with national and EU regulatory requirements.",
