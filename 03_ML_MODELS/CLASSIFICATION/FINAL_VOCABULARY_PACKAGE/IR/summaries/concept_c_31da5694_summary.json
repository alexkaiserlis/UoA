This regulatory framework aims to enhance patient care through telemedicine, electronic health records, and health information systems. The EU's legal instruments, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the eHealth Action Plan, establish guidelines for data protection, interoperability, and the promotion of digital health solutions. By fostering innovation and ensuring patient safety, the EU seeks to create a cohesive e-Health ecosystem that supports cross-border healthcare services and improves public health outcomes.",
