  "summary": "The concept of \"wholesale price\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to the price charged for goods sold in bulk, typically to retailers or distributors, rather than directly to consumers. This pricing regime is crucial for sectors such as poultrymeat, eggs, and processed vegetables, where tariffs and duties are applied. Notifications regarding wholesale prices are essential for maintaining consistency across member states, particularly in outermost regions like the Aegean islands. The regulation of these prices involves monitoring and correcting discrepancies in documentation, ensuring that payments and records align with established codes. This promotes fair competition and transparency in the circulation of goods, including bananas and lactalbumin.",
