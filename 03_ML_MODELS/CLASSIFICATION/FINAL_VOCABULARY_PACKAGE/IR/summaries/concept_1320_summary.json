  "summary": "The concept of \"non-personal tax\" refers to a category of taxation that is levied on entities rather than individuals, distinguishing it from personal income taxes. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, non-personal taxes encompass various forms of taxation, such as corporate taxes, value-added taxes (VAT), and property taxes, which are designed to generate revenue for public expenditure. These taxes are crucial for maintaining fiscal stability within member states and ensuring compliance with EU directives on taxation. The regulation of non-personal taxes is essential for harmonizing tax policies across the EU, thereby fostering economic integration and competition.",
