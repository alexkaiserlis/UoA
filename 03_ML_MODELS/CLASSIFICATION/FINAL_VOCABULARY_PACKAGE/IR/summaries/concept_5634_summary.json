  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"fanaticism\" is redirected to the preferred term \"extremism,\" which encompasses ideologies that promote violence and intolerance. The EU has implemented measures to combat extremism by imposing sanctions on specific groups and entities associated with terrorist networks, such as those linked to Usama bin Laden, Al-Qaeda, and the Taliban. These measures include freezing funds and resources, banning the export of certain goods and services, and amending lists of covered persons. The EU's approach aims to strengthen security by prohibiting activities that support extremist ideologies, thereby ensuring compliance with international obligations and enhancing collective safety.",
