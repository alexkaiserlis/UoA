  "summary": "The term \"anti-European movement\" refers to a spectrum of political and social actions that oppose the principles and integration efforts of the European Union (EU). In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such movements may challenge the foundational tenets of European construction, including the promotion of unity, cooperation, and shared governance among member states. These movements can manifest through various forms of dissent, including populism and nationalism, which may undermine the EU's regulatory mechanisms designed to foster cohesion and stability. Understanding the implications of anti-European movements is crucial for policymakers aiming to safeguard the integrity of the EU's legal architecture.",
