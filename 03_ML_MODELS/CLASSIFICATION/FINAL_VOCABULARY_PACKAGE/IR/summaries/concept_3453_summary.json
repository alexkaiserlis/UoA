  "summary": "The concept of \"European security\" encompasses the EU's strategic framework for fostering international stability and defense cooperation. It involves the rationalisation of security policies through the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), which is critical for enhancing the EU's global role. The EU promotes the establishment of infrastructures that support security operations, including the deployment of observers and contractors in conflict zones like Bosnia and Herzegovina. Meetings during the presidency often elaborate on the automatic designation of security measures, ensuring freedoms are maintained. This framework is further strengthened by the adoption of innovative approaches and preparatory planning, which avails powerful tools for collective defense and exploitation of resources.",
