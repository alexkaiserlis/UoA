  "summary": "Social mobility refers to the ability of individuals or groups to move within a social hierarchy, often influenced by factors such as education, employment opportunities, and socio-economic status. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, social mobility is a critical component of social inclusion policies aimed at reducing inequality and promoting equitable access to resources. The EU emphasizes the importance of social mobility in fostering a cohesive society, where individuals can achieve their potential regardless of their background. This concept underpins various initiatives and directives designed to enhance educational access, labor market integration, and overall social equity across member states.",
