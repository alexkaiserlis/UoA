  "summary": "The \"elimination of illiteracy\" is a pivotal objective within the EU's educational framework, aimed at fostering inclusive and equitable access to education. This concept is enshrined in various EU legal and regulatory documents, emphasizing the necessity for member states to implement comprehensive literacy programs. The EU recognizes that illiteracy undermines individual potential and societal cohesion, thus mandating initiatives that promote lifelong learning and educational attainment. By addressing illiteracy, the EU seeks to enhance social integration and economic participation, aligning with broader goals of human rights and sustainable development. This commitment is reflected in policies that encourage collaboration among member states to share best practices and resources.",
