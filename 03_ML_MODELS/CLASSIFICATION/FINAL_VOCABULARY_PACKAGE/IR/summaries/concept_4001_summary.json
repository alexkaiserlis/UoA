  "summary": "The concept of \"use of outer space\" encompasses the legal and regulatory frameworks governing activities in space, emphasizing multilateralism and international cooperation. The EU acknowledges the growing implications of outer space, advocating for responsible use to preserve peace and prevent conflicts. Key actors, including nations and international organizations, are called to discuss challenges posed by space debris and the expanding resource demands of space exploration. The EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) underlines the importance of successful meetings in forums like Vienna and Bangkok, aimed at equipping nations with the confidence to address sensitive issues and enhance collective responsibilities in outer space governance.",
