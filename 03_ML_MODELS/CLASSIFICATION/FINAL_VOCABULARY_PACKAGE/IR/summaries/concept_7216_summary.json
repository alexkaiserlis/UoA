  "summary": "Social democracy, as a political framework within the European Union, emphasizes the integration of democratic governance with social justice principles. It advocates for a regulatory environment that promotes equitable economic policies, social welfare, and the protection of individual rights. In EU legal documents, social democracy underpins various legislative measures aimed at enhancing social cohesion and reducing disparities among member states. This concept is pivotal in shaping policies that balance market efficiency with social equity, ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are distributed fairly. Consequently, social democracy serves as a foundational ideology influencing EU governance and regulatory practices.",
