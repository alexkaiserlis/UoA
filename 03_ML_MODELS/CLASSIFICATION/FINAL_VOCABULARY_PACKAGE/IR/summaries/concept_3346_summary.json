  "summary": "European social policy serves as a cornerstone of the EU's legal framework, addressing the needs of marginalized groups and dependents. It aims to optimize social welfare through the formalization of rights, including maternity leave and childcare provisions. The policy encompasses various strands, such as microfinance initiatives and scholarships, which support career aspirations and alleviate insecurity. The Open Method of Coordination (OMC) facilitates the interaction between member states, allowing for the sharing of best practices and the streamlining of social services. By addressing issues like illness and breastfeeding, the EU seeks to enhance the well-being of all citizens, including pregnant individuals and their families.",
