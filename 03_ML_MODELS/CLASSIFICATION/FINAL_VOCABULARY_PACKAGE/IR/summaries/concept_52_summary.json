  "summary": "The concept of \"population structure,\" redirected to the preferred term \"composition of the population,\" is crucial in EU legal and regulatory frameworks concerning demography and population studies. This concept encompasses the various demographic characteristics that define a population, including age, gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status. Understanding the composition of the population is essential for formulating policies related to social inclusion, labor markets, and public health. Accurate demographic data informs EU institutions in their decision-making processes, ensuring that regulations and directives are tailored to the needs of diverse population segments, thereby promoting equitable development across member states.",
