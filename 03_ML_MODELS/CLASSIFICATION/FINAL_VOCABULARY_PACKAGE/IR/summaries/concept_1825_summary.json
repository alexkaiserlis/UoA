  "summary": "The concept of \"money supply\" is pivotal in monetary economics, particularly within the EU's regulatory framework. It refers to the total amount of monetary assets available in an economy at a specific time, influencing inflation, interest rates, and overall economic stability. The European Central Bank (ECB) monitors and regulates the money supply to ensure price stability across member states. Legal instruments, such as directives and regulations, guide the ECB's policies on money supply management, impacting fiscal policies and economic governance in the EU. Understanding this concept is essential for comprehending the broader implications of monetary policy in the European Union.",
