  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"working capital\" refers to the amount of liquid assets available to a business for its day-to-day operations, crucial for maintaining liquidity and operational efficiency. It encompasses the allocation of current assets and liabilities, with adjustments made for accrued income and realised gains or losses. The European Central Bank (ECB) monitors these metrics, particularly in the banking sector, to ensure stability in monetary policy. Effective management of working capital involves pooling resources and managing disposals of securities, which can impact the overall financial health of institutions. Statutes governing these operations establish frameworks for calculation and adjustment, ensuring that banks maintain sufficient liquidity until the end of the fiscal year.",
