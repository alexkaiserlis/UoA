  "summary": "Impunity refers to the exemption from punishment or loss of accountability for criminal actions, a concept critical in the context of EU criminal law. It undermines the rule of law and can foster a culture of lawlessness, where offenders evade justice. The EU has established various legal frameworks aimed at combating impunity, particularly in cases involving serious crimes such as human trafficking and corruption. These frameworks emphasize the importance of accountability and the need for member states to ensure that perpetrators are prosecuted effectively. Addressing impunity is essential for maintaining public trust in legal institutions and upholding fundamental rights within the EU.",
