  "summary": "The concept of \"organisation of health care\" pertains to the structured framework within which health services are delivered and managed across the European Union. It encompasses various regulatory mechanisms that ensure the effective allocation of resources, coordination of services, and adherence to health standards. This term is crucial in EU legal documents as it relates to directives and regulations aimed at harmonizing health care systems among member states. The redirect from \"organization of health care\" to \"organisation of health care\" highlights the preference for British English terminology in EU contexts, reflecting the linguistic diversity within the Union while maintaining a focus on health governance and policy coherence.",
