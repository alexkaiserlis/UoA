  "summary": "The \"regulation of agricultural production\" within the EU legal framework encompasses various measures aimed at enhancing agricultural efficiency and sustainability. This includes the establishment of agrienvironmental programs that aidable farmers in adopting practices that reduce environmental impact. Regulatory bodies may oversee the use of specific inputs, such as monocalciumphosphate and dicalciumphosphate, to ensure compliance with safety standards. Additionally, the EU promotes research centers that incubate innovative agricultural technologies, including those utilizing pheromones for pest control. By summarizing data on production statistics, the EU seeks to prevent overshoots in agricultural output, thereby maintaining ecological balance across diverse subregions like Mikkeli and Katerini.",
