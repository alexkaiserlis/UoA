  "summary": "Ministerial responsibility is a fundamental principle within the EUâ€™s executive power framework, ensuring that ministers are accountable for their actions and decisions. This concept is particularly relevant in the context of the Council and Commission, where decisions concerning economic measures and the freezing of funds are made. Under the Treaty on European Union, ministers must act in accordance with established regulations and ensure that their positions respect the interests of the communities they serve. Effective governance requires that any amending decisions are immediately communicated, covered in the official journal, and listed in annexes to ensure transparency and compliance with common policies.",
