  "summary": "The concept of \"longevity,\" categorized under demography and population, is redirected to the preferred term \"life expectancy\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Life expectancy serves as a critical indicator of public health and socio-economic conditions across member states. It informs various EU policies, including those related to healthcare, social security, and demographic trends. By analyzing life expectancy, EU institutions can assess the effectiveness of health interventions and demographic strategies, ensuring that legislative measures align with the evolving needs of an aging population. This concept underscores the importance of demographic data in shaping informed policy decisions at the EU level.",
