  "summary": "The \"EU environmental policy\" encompasses a comprehensive framework aimed at promoting sustainability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions across member states. It emphasizes recyclability and recoverability of materials, urging developers to adopt innovative practices that enhance reusability. The policy includes regulations on harmful substances like trifluoromethane and chlorodifluoromethane, addressing their impact on climate change. It also involves standardizing emissions trading systems, such as the auctioning of carbon credits (CERs) and the establishment of registries for monitoring emissions. The EU's ambition aligns with international agreements like those from Cancun and Kyiv, focusing on abating nitrous oxide emissions and transitioning to hydropower. Through interlaboratory collaborations and modelling efforts, the EU aims to differentiate its environmental standards, ensuring effective implementation and compliance.",
