  "summary": "The term \"SELA countries\" refers to the member states of the Latin American and Caribbean Economic System, which are often discussed in the context of economic geography within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. This concept is redirected to \"LAES countries,\" indicating a preference for the latter terminology in official documents. The relationship underscores the EU's engagement with economic cooperation and trade relations with these regions. Understanding the dynamics of SELA countries is crucial for EU policies aimed at fostering economic partnerships, enhancing trade agreements, and promoting sustainable development initiatives in line with broader international regulatory standards.",
