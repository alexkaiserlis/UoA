  "summary": "A \"legal rule\" is a fundamental principle or directive established within the framework of law, serving as a guideline for behavior and decision-making. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, legal rules are essential for ensuring compliance with both primary and secondary legislation. They provide clarity and predictability in the application of laws across member states, facilitating harmonization and integration within the EU legal system. Legal rules can originate from various sources, including treaties, regulations, and directives, and they play a crucial role in the enforcement of rights and obligations, thereby underpinning the rule of law in the EU.",
