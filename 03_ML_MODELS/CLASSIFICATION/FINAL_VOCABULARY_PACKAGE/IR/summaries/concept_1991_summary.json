  "summary": "The term \"mortality rate,\" redirected to \"mortality,\" is a crucial concept within EU demography and population studies, particularly in the context of legal and regulatory frameworks. It serves as an essential indicator for actuaries and policymakers, providing insights into demographic trends and socioeconomic inequalities. Eurostat disseminates mortality data, disaggregated by gender and age, to inform projections and enhance objectivity in policymaking. This data is vital for addressing challenges related to ageing populations and ensuring sustainability in public health initiatives. The use of mortality statistics aids councils in developing impartial strategies that promote solidarity across generations and geographic territories, ultimately fostering a healthier society.",
