  "summary": "Parental authority, a fundamental concept within EU family law, refers to the legal rights and responsibilities that parents hold regarding their children. This authority encompasses various aspects, including custody, guardianship, and the duty to care for and protect the childâ€™s welfare. In the context of EU regulations, parental authority is crucial for cross-border family disputes, particularly in matters of child abduction and custody arrangements. The EU has established legal frameworks, such as the Brussels II bis Regulation, to ensure the effective exercise of parental authority across member states, thereby promoting the child's best interests and legal certainty in familial relations.",
