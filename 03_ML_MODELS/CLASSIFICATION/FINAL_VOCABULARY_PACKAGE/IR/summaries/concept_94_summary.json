  "summary": "The concept of \"conflict of prerogatives,\" redirected to the preferred term \"conflict of jurisdiction,\" pertains to the legal complexities arising when multiple authorities assert their rights over a specific matter within the EU legal framework. This situation often leads to disputes regarding the applicable legal norms and the competent jurisdiction to adjudicate cases. Such conflicts can impede the effective administration of justice and challenge the coherence of the legal system. Understanding these conflicts is crucial for ensuring the proper delineation of powers among EU institutions and member states, thereby enhancing legal certainty and regulatory compliance across the Union.",
