  "summary": "Soil chemistry is a critical aspect of environmental science, particularly within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks aimed at sustainable land management and environmental protection. It encompasses the study of the chemical composition and properties of soil, which are essential for understanding soil fertility, pollutant interactions, and ecosystem health. EU regulations, such as the Soil Protection Directive, emphasize the importance of monitoring soil chemistry to prevent degradation and ensure sustainable agricultural practices. This concept is vital for assessing soil quality, informing land use policies, and implementing measures to mitigate soil contamination, thereby supporting the EU's broader environmental objectives.",
