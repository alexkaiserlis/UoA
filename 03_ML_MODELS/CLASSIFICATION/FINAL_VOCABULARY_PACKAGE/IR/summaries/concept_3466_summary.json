  "summary": "The \"signature of an agreement\" in EU legal and regulatory contexts refers to the formal act whereby parties, including multiparty arrangements such as those under the Euromed framework, endorse a document, thereby inscribing their commitments. This process often involves reconvened discussions, elaborates on specific terms, and can cater to diverse issues like oceanographic research or firearms regulation under frameworks like the FCTC. Agreements may also address regional concerns, such as the Sahel or Andean initiatives, and involve parties from various collectivity backgrounds, including Gabonese and Mauritian stakeholders. The signature signifies a commitment to parallelism in implementation, ensuring that obligations, such as those outlined in the TDCA or WIPO treaties, are upheld.",
