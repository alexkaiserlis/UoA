  "summary": "\"Non-compulsory expenditure\" refers to budgetary allocations within the European Union that are not mandated by law but are instead subject to discretionary decision-making by EU institutions. This category encompasses spending on various initiatives that enhance EU objectives, such as research, development, and cultural programs. Unlike compulsory expenditure, which is legally binding and essential for the functioning of the EU, non-compulsory expenditure allows for flexibility in financial planning and prioritization. It reflects the EU's commitment to fostering innovation and cohesion among member states while adhering to the principles of sound financial management and accountability in the allocation of resources.",
