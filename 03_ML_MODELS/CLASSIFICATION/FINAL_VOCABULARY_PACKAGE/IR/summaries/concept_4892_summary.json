  "summary": "Biomass energy, also referred to as bioenergy, is a critical category within the EU's soft energy framework. It encompasses various materials, including composting byproducts, biogas, and manure, which are processed to develop alternative energy sources. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) plays a pivotal role in ensuring the safety and validity of these materials for human consumption and animal feed. Regulatory frameworks allow operators to adjust their practices in line with strict standards, enabling the sustainable trade of bioenergy products. As the industry continues to evolve, transitional regulations may extend existing measures to further enhance health and environmental relevance, ensuring that bioenergy contributes effectively to the EU's energy goals.",
