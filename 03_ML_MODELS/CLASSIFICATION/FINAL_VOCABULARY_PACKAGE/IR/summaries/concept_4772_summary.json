  "summary": "Wallis and Futuna, categorized under the EU's designation of overseas countries and territories, represents a unique legal entity within the framework of EU regulatory documents. This French overseas collectivity is not part of the EU but maintains a special relationship with it, influencing its regulatory landscape. The legal status of Wallis and Futuna allows for specific provisions under EU law, particularly in areas such as trade and development assistance. Although it does not fall under the direct jurisdiction of EU law, the region's connection to France facilitates certain regulatory interactions, thereby impacting the broader context of EU external relations and cooperation with overseas territories.",
