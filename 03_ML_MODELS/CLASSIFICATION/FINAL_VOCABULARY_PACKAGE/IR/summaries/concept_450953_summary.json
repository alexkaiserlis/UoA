  "summary": "The \"African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights,\" also known as the \"African Court of Justice and Human Rights,\" serves as a pivotal extraterritorial judicial body within the African Union framework. It aims to enhance the protection of human rights and ensure adherence to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, this court's decisions may influence EU external relations and human rights policies, particularly in fostering cooperation with African nations. The redirect to the preferred term underscores its dual mandate, integrating both justice and human rights within its jurisdiction.",
