  "summary": "The concept of \"humanitarian tourism,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"equitable tourism,\" pertains to travel initiatives aimed at fostering social equity and supporting vulnerable communities. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, equitable tourism emphasizes sustainable practices that align with social affairs policies. It seeks to balance the economic benefits of tourism with the need for social responsibility, ensuring that local populations receive fair compensation and opportunities. This approach is increasingly relevant in EU discussions on tourism regulation, as it promotes ethical engagement and the protection of cultural heritage while addressing the socio-economic disparities exacerbated by traditional tourism models.",
