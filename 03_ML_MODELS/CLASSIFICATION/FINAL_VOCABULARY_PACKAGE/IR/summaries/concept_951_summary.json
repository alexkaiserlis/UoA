  "summary": "Extra-territoriality refers to the application of a state's laws beyond its territorial boundaries, particularly in the context of international law. Within the EU legal framework, this concept is significant as it governs how EU regulations can impact entities operating outside the Union. For instance, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) exemplifies extra-territoriality by imposing obligations on non-EU companies that process the personal data of EU citizens. This principle underscores the EU's commitment to protecting fundamental rights and ensuring compliance with its legal standards, even in a globalized context where jurisdictional limits are increasingly blurred.",
