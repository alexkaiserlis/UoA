  "summary": "Social statistics refer to the systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data related to societal conditions and trends within the European Union. This concept is integral to the EU's legal and regulatory framework, as it informs policy-making and the evaluation of social programs. By providing empirical evidence on demographics, employment, education, and health, social statistics enable EU institutions to assess the effectiveness of legislation and ensure compliance with social standards. Furthermore, they facilitate comparative analyses among member states, fostering a cohesive social framework that supports the EU's objectives of promoting social inclusion and cohesion across diverse populations.",
