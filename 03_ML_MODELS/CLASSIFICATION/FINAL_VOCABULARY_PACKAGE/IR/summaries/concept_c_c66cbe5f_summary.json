  "summary": "Light pollution refers to the excessive or misdirected artificial light that disrupts natural darkness, adversely affecting ecosystems and human health. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, light pollution is recognized as a significant factor contributing to the deterioration of the environment. The European Union has initiated various directives aimed at mitigating light pollution, promoting sustainable urban planning, and enhancing energy efficiency. These regulations encourage member states to adopt measures that limit unnecessary artificial illumination, thereby preserving biodiversity and improving the quality of life for citizens. Addressing light pollution is essential for achieving broader environmental protection goals within the EU.",
