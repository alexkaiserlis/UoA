  "summary": "Land speculation, often referred to as building speculation in EU legal and regulatory contexts, pertains to the practice of purchasing land with the intention of profiting from its future development or appreciation in value. This concept is critical in construction and town planning regulations, as it can significantly influence urban development patterns and housing markets. The EU framework seeks to address the implications of land speculation through various directives aimed at sustainable urban planning and environmental protection. By redirecting to the preferred term \"building speculation,\" the focus shifts towards understanding the regulatory measures necessary to manage speculative practices in the construction sector effectively.",
