  "summary": "The concept of \"industrial secret\" refers to confidential information that provides a competitive advantage to businesses within the EU. It encompasses technical know-how, manufacturing processes, and proprietary data that are not publicly disclosed. The legal framework surrounding industrial secrets is primarily governed by the EU Directive on the protection of undisclosed know-how and business information (2016/943), which aims to harmonize national laws and enhance protection against misappropriation. This regulatory approach ensures that companies can safeguard their innovations and maintain their market position, thereby fostering technological advancement and economic growth within the internal market.",
