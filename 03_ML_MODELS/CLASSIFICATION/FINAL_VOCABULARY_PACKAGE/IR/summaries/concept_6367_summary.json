  "summary": "International commercial arbitration is a pivotal mechanism in resolving disputes arising from cross-border trade within the EU and beyond. It involves arbitrators who facilitate the settlement of conflicts, often related to tariffs, subsidies, and custom regulations. The process operates under frameworks established by the WTO and GATT, where rulings can be upheld or nullified by appellate panels. This method promotes cooperation among parties, allowing them to negotiate concessions and avoid the impairment of trade relations. By facilitating efficient dispute resolution, arbitration decreases the need for lengthy litigation, thereby ensuring that cultural and fiscal exchanges persist without automatic imposition of countervailing duties or dumping allegations.",
