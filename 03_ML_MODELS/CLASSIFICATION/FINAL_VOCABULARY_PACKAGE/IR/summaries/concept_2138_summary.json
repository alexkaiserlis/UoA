  "summary": "The \"Sultanate of Oman,\" redirecting to the preferred term \"Oman,\" is a significant entity in political geography relevant to EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Oman engages in various diplomatic and economic relations with countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar, impacting procurement and trade agreements. Its strategic position necessitates compliance with international standards, including those set by the OECD. Legal documents may disclose information regarding visa regulations for EU citizens traveling to Oman, while questionnaires and reviews from the Directorate General for Foreign Relations (DGFR) assess compliance. The compelling geopolitical dynamics with neighboring states, such as Iran and Yemen, further influence EU policy considerations.",
