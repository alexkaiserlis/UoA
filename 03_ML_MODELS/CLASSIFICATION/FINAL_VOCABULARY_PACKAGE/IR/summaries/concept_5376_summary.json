  "summary": "The \"chamber of commerce and industry\" is a crucial institution within the EU's trade policy framework, established to support commerce and facilitate economic cooperation among member states. In Cyprus, for instance, both the Greek and Turkish communities have their respective chambers, which are duly authorised to issue documents and regulate trade activities. These chambers play an effective role in controlling the flow of goods and services, ensuring compliance with EU regulations. According to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the chambers are notified of necessary agreements and authorisations, thereby contributing to the overall governance of trade within the Union.",
