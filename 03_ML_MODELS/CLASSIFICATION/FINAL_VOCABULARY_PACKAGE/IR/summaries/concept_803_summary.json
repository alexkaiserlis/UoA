  "summary": "A \"horizontal agreement\" refers to a type of agreement between competitors operating at the same level of the supply chain. In the context of EU competition law, these agreements can potentially restrict competition by coordinating prices, output, or market shares. Such practices may lead to anti-competitive effects, which are scrutinized under Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The European Commission assesses horizontal agreements to ensure they do not infringe on the principles of free competition, promoting a competitive internal market while allowing for certain exemptions under specific conditions, such as efficiency gains.",
