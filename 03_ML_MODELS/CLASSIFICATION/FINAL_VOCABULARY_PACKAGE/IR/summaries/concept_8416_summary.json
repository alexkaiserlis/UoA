  "summary": "The concept of \"potential conflict of interests,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"conflict of interest,\" is pivotal in EU labour law and labour relations. It refers to situations where an individual's personal interests may improperly influence their professional obligations, potentially undermining the integrity of decision-making processes. In the EU regulatory framework, addressing conflicts of interest is essential to ensure transparency and accountability, particularly in public service and procurement contexts. Effective management of such conflicts is crucial for maintaining trust in institutions and safeguarding the principles of fair competition and ethical conduct within the labour market.",
