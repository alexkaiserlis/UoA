  "summary": "The concept of \"peaceful co-existence\" is pivotal in the realm of international security within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. It underscores the necessity for states to maintain harmonious relations, thereby preventing conflicts and fostering stability. This principle is often reflected in EU treaties and policies aimed at promoting diplomacy, dialogue, and mutual respect among member states and third countries. By advocating for peaceful co-existence, the EU seeks to enhance collective security and uphold the rule of law, ensuring that disputes are resolved through negotiation rather than aggression. This concept is integral to the EU's broader commitment to global peace and security.",
