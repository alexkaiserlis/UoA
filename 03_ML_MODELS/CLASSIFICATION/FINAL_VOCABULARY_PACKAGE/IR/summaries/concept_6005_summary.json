  "summary": "An \"arbitration clause\" is a provision within a contract that mandates the resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than litigation. In the context of EU civil law, such clauses are significant as they facilitate alternative dispute resolution (ADR), promoting efficiency and reducing the burden on judicial systems. The enforceability of arbitration clauses is governed by various EU regulations, including the Brussels I Regulation, which ensures that parties can rely on their contractual agreements. This mechanism enhances legal certainty and predictability in cross-border transactions, aligning with the EU's objectives of fostering a cohesive internal market and protecting the rights of parties involved.",
