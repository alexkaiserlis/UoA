  "summary": "The concept of \"replacement of generations,\" redirected to the preferred term \"generation renewal,\" pertains to demographic shifts within the European Union. This concept is crucial in understanding population dynamics, particularly in the context of aging populations and declining birth rates. EU legal and regulatory frameworks often address generation renewal to ensure sustainable development and social cohesion. Policies may focus on enhancing family support, promoting work-life balance, and encouraging immigration to counteract demographic challenges. By fostering generation renewal, the EU aims to maintain a balanced demographic structure, which is essential for economic stability and social welfare across member states.",
