  "summary": "Rural migration refers to the movement of individuals or families from urban areas to rural regions, often driven by factors such as economic opportunities, lifestyle changes, or environmental considerations. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, rural migration can impact various policies, including those related to regional development, agricultural support, and social integration. The EU recognizes the significance of rural migration in addressing demographic challenges and promoting sustainable development. Consequently, it may influence funding allocations and strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing rural infrastructure, fostering community resilience, and ensuring equitable access to resources for migrants and local populations alike.",
