  "summary": "The concept of \"volunteer\" in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks is primarily associated with \"voluntary military service.\" This term denotes the enlistment of individuals in military roles without coercion, emphasizing personal choice and commitment. In EU member states, voluntary military service is governed by national laws that align with EU directives on defense and security. The regulatory landscape ensures that such service is conducted in compliance with human rights standards and operational effectiveness. This redirect highlights the preference for \"voluntary military service\" as the more precise terminology, reflecting its significance in defense policy discussions within the EU.",
