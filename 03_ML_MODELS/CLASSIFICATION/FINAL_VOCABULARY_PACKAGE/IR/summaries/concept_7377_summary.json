  "summary": "A \"monarchist party\" is a political party that advocates for the restoration or maintenance of a monarchy as a form of governance. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such parties may participate in the democratic process, contributing to the pluralism of political representation. While the European Union promotes democratic values, including respect for diverse political ideologies, the presence of monarchist parties can raise discussions about the compatibility of monarchical principles with EU democratic standards. These parties operate under the same legal obligations as other political entities, ensuring adherence to electoral regulations and transparency in their activities.",
