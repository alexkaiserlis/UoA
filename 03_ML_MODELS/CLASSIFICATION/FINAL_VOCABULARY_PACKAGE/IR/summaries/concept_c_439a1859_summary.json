  "summary": "An \"information technology incident\" refers to any event that compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information systems and data, particularly within the context of EU regulations. Such incidents can include data breaches, cyberattacks, or system failures that disrupt normal operations. The EU's legal framework, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive), mandates that organizations report significant incidents to relevant authorities. This regulatory oversight aims to enhance cybersecurity resilience and protect personal data across member states, ensuring compliance with established standards and fostering trust in digital services.",
