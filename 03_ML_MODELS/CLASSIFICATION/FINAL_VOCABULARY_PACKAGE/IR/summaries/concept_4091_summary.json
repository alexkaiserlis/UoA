  "summary": "A \"public hearing\" is a formal procedure within parliamentary proceedings in the European Union, designed to facilitate transparency and democratic participation. During these hearings, stakeholders, including citizens, experts, and interest groups, are invited to present their views on specific legislative proposals or policy issues. This process not only enhances the accountability of EU institutions but also ensures that diverse perspectives are considered in decision-making. Public hearings are integral to the legislative process, allowing for the collection of evidence and fostering dialogue between lawmakers and the public, thereby reinforcing the principles of participatory democracy within the EU framework.",
