  "summary": "The \"publication of a law\" is a critical step in the legislative process within the European Union's parliamentary proceedings. It signifies the formal dissemination of legal texts, ensuring transparency and accessibility for citizens and stakeholders. Following the adoption of a law, its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) is mandatory, marking the law's entry into force. This process not only facilitates compliance but also enhances the rule of law by providing a reliable source for legal reference. The publication serves as a vital instrument for legal certainty and public awareness, reinforcing democratic accountability in EU governance.",
