  "summary": "The concept of \"statistical methodology,\" redirected to the preferred term \"statistical method,\" plays a crucial role in EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Policymakers rely on robust statistical methods to evaluate economic impacts, particularly in areas such as healthcare, where illnesses like musculoskeletal disorders are assessed through hierarchical models. Statisticians utilize subsample techniques to dissect data, ensuring accurate representation of populations, including childhood and adulthood demographics. This methodology aids in econometrics and antifraud efforts, impacting wellbeing assessments. Fieldwork and animation of data enhance understanding, while organizations like the Drees and the Eläketurvakeskus contribute to comprehensive evaluations, ensuring that statistical analyses remain relevant and effective in addressing undercapacity and extraregio challenges.",
