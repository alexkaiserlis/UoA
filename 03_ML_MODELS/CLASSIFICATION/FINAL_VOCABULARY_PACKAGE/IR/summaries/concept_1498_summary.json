  "summary": "The concept of \"breach of domicile\" pertains to the infringement of an individual's right to reside in a particular location, a fundamental aspect of personal freedoms recognized within EU law. This breach can occur when authorities unjustly interfere with a person's established residence, violating their rights under various EU regulations and directives that protect individual freedoms. Such violations may lead to legal recourse, ensuring that the principles of domicile are upheld. The EU emphasizes the importance of safeguarding domicile rights to promote stability and security for its citizens, reflecting broader commitments to human rights and the rule of law.",
