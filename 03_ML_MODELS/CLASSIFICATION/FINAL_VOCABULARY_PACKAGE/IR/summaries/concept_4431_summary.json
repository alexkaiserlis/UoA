  "summary": "The concept of \"telephony,\" redirected to the preferred term \"telephone,\" encompasses a range of telecommunications services within the EU regulatory framework. It includes traditional Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTNs) and modern digital services like DSL and VoIP. The regulatory landscape often resembles a patchwork, necessitating discernment in compliance for entrants in the market. Key elements include unbundling of services, ensuring inexpensive access for subscribers, and the ubiquity of handsets. Regulations also govern dialling procedures, freephone services, and emergency eCalls to Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs). The organizational structure of telecommunications mandates comprehensive comprehension of these systems, ensuring effective communication and service delivery.",
