  "summary": "The term \"border war\" refers to conflicts that arise along national boundaries, often involving military engagement or territorial disputes. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such conflicts pose significant challenges to international security and stability. The EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) aims to address these issues by promoting conflict prevention and crisis management. Legal instruments, such as treaties and regulations, facilitate cooperation among member states to enhance border security and mitigate the risks associated with border wars. The EU's approach emphasizes diplomacy, conflict resolution, and the protection of human rights in border regions.",
