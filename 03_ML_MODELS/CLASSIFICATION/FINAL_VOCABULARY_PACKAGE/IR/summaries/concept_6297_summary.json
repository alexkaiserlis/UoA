  "summary": "The \"diffusion of innovations\" refers to the process through which new technologies and practices are adopted and spread within societies, particularly in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks. This concept is crucial for understanding how regulatory measures can facilitate or hinder the adoption of innovative solutions across member states. The EU aims to promote the diffusion of innovations through policies that encourage research and development, harmonization of standards, and the establishment of a conducive regulatory environment. By fostering an ecosystem that supports innovation, the EU seeks to enhance technological advancement and competitiveness within the internal market.",
