  "summary": "The Treaty of Nice, signed in 2001, is a pivotal legal instrument in the evolution of the European Union's institutional framework. It aimed to reform the EU's decision-making processes in anticipation of the enlargement to include new member states. The treaty introduced significant changes, such as the adjustment of voting weights in the Council and the extension of qualified majority voting. Additionally, it enhanced the powers of the European Parliament and established the legal basis for the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Treaty of Nice thus represents a crucial step in the EU's regulatory development, shaping its governance and legislative efficiency.",
