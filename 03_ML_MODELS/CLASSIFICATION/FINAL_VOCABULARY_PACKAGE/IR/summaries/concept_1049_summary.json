  "summary": "The term \"inshore grounds\" refers to coastal areas that are typically characterized by shallow waters, which are significant for various ecological and economic activities within the EU's regulatory framework. These regions are crucial for the conservation of marine biodiversity and the sustainable management of fisheries, as they often serve as breeding and nursery grounds for numerous species. EU legislation, such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, emphasizes the protection of inshore grounds to ensure the health of marine ecosystems. Effective governance of these areas is essential for balancing environmental sustainability with economic interests, particularly in the context of maritime spatial planning.",
