  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"large undertaking\" is synonymous with \"large business,\" referring to entities that meet specific criteria regarding size and economic impact. These organizations often serve as pivotal levers for internationalisation, contributing to diverse supply chains and fostering multidimensional relationships. Large businesses are encouraged to adopt corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices, enhancing accountability and mitigating risks of bribery and corruption. Their operations must align with EU directives, ensuring diligence in subcontracting and oversight of outcomes.
