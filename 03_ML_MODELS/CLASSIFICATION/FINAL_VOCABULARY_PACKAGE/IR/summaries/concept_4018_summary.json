  "summary": "Secondary legislation refers to legal acts created under the authority of primary legislation, enabling the European Union to implement policies efficiently. This structured framework allows for the adaptation of EU laws to specific contexts, especially concerning small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and other stakeholders. By simplifying processes and reducing burdens, secondary legislation helps businesses and administrations to operate effectively. Regular assessments and reports from independent boards ensure that these measures align with the EU's priorities. The mandate of secondary legislation is to create a flexible legal environment that can adapt to the evolving needs of its members while maximizing potential savings and minimizing the impact of burdensome regulations.",
