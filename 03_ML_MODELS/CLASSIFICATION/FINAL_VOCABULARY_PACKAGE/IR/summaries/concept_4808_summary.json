  "summary": "The \"tropical zone\" refers to regions characterized by warm climates, which are susceptible to various diseases affecting both aquatic and terrestrial animals. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept becomes crucial for governing the import and export of ornamental fish and other animals. Member states, such as the Maldives, officially join international agreements, ensuring compliance with obligations related to certification and notification processes. The EU's commitment to fulfilling food safety standards includes monitoring imports from tropical territories, thereby placing a focus on the latest health regulations. This regulatory landscape aims to mitigate risks posed by diseases while supporting aquaculture and trade chains.",
