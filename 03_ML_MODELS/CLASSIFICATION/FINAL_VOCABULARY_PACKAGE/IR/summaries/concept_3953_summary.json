  "summary": "\"Solitary confinement,\" a term redirected to \"imprisonment,\" pertains to the legal and regulatory frameworks within EU criminal law. It involves the detention of individuals in isolation, raising significant implications for human rights and security policy. The European Union, through its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), has negotiated agreements that mandate humane treatment of detained persons. Detailed arrangements for solitary confinement are often included in protocols and annexed documents, ensuring compliance with adopted standards. The implementation of these policies requires the participation of member states, with Denmark's representative often playing a central role in the discussions and decisions regarding the operation of such measures.",
