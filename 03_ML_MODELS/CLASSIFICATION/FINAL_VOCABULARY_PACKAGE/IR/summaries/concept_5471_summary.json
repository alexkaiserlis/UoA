  "summary": "Air cabotage refers to the operation of air transport services between two points within a single Member State by an airline registered in another Member State. This concept is crucial in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly under the EU's Single Aviation Market. The regulatory framework aims to enhance competition and consumer choice while ensuring safety and environmental standards. Air cabotage rights are governed by Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008, which establishes conditions for air carriers to operate freely within the EU. This facilitates seamless connectivity and promotes economic integration among Member States, fostering a more efficient air transport sector.",
