  "summary": "The \"Cyprus question\" pertains to the longstanding geopolitical and legal issues surrounding the division of Cyprus, which has implications for international security and EU regulatory frameworks. This situation arose from the 1974 Turkish invasion, leading to the island's partition into the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, the latter recognized only by Turkey. The EU's involvement is significant, as it seeks to promote reconciliation and stability in the region, aligning with its broader objectives of peace and security. The resolution of the Cyprus question remains a critical aspect of EU foreign policy and legal discourse, influencing relations with member and non-member states alike.",
