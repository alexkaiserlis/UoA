  "summary": "\"Spatial data\" refers to information that represents the physical location and shape of objects in a defined space, often utilized within the context of geographic information systems (GIS). In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, spatial data is crucial for various applications, including environmental monitoring, urban planning, and transportation management. The European Union promotes the sharing and accessibility of spatial data through initiatives like the INSPIRE Directive, which aims to create a European spatial data infrastructure. This regulatory approach enhances data interoperability, supports informed decision-making, and fosters collaboration among member states, ultimately contributing to sustainable development and efficient governance.",
