  "summary": "The concept of \"family solidarity\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks emphasizes the importance of familial bonds and mutual support among family members. It underpins various EU policies aimed at enhancing social cohesion and welfare, particularly in areas such as migration, social security, and family reunification. Family solidarity is crucial in ensuring that family units can maintain their integrity and provide emotional and economic support to one another. This principle is often reflected in EU legislation that seeks to protect the rights of family members, thereby fostering a more inclusive and supportive environment for families across member states.",
