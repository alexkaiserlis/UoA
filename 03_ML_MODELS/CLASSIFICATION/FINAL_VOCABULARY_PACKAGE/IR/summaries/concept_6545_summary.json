  "summary": "The concept \"Christian\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to the social framework category, specifically addressing the intersection of religious identity and social policy. While the term itself lacks direct related words or frequent usage in legal texts, it embodies the broader principles of religious freedom and the protection of minority rights within the EU. The legal context often involves considerations of how Christian values influence social cohesion, cultural heritage, and community engagement. This concept underscores the importance of inclusivity and respect for diverse belief systems in shaping EU policies and regulations that promote social harmony and integration among member states.",
