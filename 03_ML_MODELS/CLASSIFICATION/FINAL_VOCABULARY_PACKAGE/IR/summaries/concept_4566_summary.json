  "summary": "The concept of \"clover,\" categorized under plant products (6006), encompasses various species, including Trifolium hybridum and alsike clover. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, clover is significant for its role in horticulture and as fodder, particularly in the production of certified seeds for crops like sorghum and Sudan grass.
