  "summary": "The \"investment policy\" within the EU legal framework operates as a critical component for guiding financial activities and fostering economic growth. It is attuned to the needs of various sectors, including maritime and construction, where consortia of companies may seek grants for projects. The policy outlines justifiable restrictions on investments, ensuring that contracts respect dominant market positions and do not lead to concerted practices that could block competition. It provides indicators for assessing investment viability and includes clauses that address penalties for non-compliance. By establishing clear justifications for investment decisions, the policy aims to create a transparent environment, ultimately enhancing the outcome of EU financial strategies.",
