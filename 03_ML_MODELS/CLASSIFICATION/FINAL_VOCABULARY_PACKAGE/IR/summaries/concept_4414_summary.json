  "summary": "The concept of \"building services\" encompasses a range of essential functions and systems integral to the operation and maintenance of buildings within the EU framework. These services include heating, ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing, and electrical systems, which are crucial for ensuring safety, comfort, and energy efficiency in public works and private constructions. Regulatory frameworks at the EU level, such as the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, mandate compliance with standards that govern the quality and sustainability of building services. This ensures that buildings not only meet functional requirements but also adhere to environmental and safety regulations, promoting a holistic approach to construction and urban development.",
