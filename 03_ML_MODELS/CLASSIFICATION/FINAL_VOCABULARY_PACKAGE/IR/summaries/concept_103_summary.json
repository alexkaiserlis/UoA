  "summary": "Maternity leave is a crucial aspect of social protection within the European Union, designed to ensure the health and well-being of mothers and their newborns. It provides a legally mandated period during which a mother is entitled to take leave from work, allowing her to recover from childbirth and bond with her child. EU regulations establish minimum standards for maternity leave, including duration and financial compensation, which member states must adhere to. This legal framework aims to promote gender equality in the workplace and safeguard the rights of working mothers, reflecting the EU's commitment to social welfare and family support.",
