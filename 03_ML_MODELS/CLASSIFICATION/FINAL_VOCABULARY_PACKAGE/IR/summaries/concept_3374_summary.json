  "summary": "Workers' representation in the context of EU labour law and labour relations encompasses the mechanisms through which employees participate in decision-making processes within their organizations. This concept is critical for ensuring that staff, such as those in the steel and coal industries, have a voice in governance. Various statutes govern the membership and representation of workers, facilitating consultative roles in international projects. Institutions like the Forschungszentrum Jülich and the Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften exemplify collaborative efforts in research and technological advancement, where workers' representation is vital. Notifications regarding candidates for representation are essential, as they ensure transparency and accountability in the designation of seats within these frameworks.",
