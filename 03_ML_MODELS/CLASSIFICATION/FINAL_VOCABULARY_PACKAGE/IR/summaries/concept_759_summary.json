  "summary": "The term \"abandoned child\" refers to a minor who has been deserted by their parents or guardians, raising significant legal and regulatory concerns within the EU framework. This concept is crucial in family law, as it implicates the protection of children's rights and welfare. EU regulations mandate member states to implement measures for the identification and care of abandoned children, ensuring their access to social services and legal representation. The abandonment of a child can lead to complex custody issues and necessitates intervention by child protection agencies, highlighting the need for a coordinated approach across jurisdictions to safeguard vulnerable minors.",
