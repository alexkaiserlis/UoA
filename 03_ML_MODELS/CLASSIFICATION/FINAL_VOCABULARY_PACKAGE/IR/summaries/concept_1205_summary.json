  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"linguistic minority\" refers to a \"linguistic group\" that is characterized by its unique language and cultural identity within a larger national framework. The recognition of linguistic groups is crucial for the promotion of cultural diversity and social cohesion within the EU. Legal instruments, such as the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, aim to protect the rights of these groups, ensuring their access to education, media, and public services in their native languages. This concept underscores the EU's commitment to safeguarding minority rights and fostering an inclusive society.",
