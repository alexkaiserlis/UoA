  "summary": "The concept of \"fighter plane,\" categorized under EU defence terminology, is a redirect to the preferred term \"fighter aircraft.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, fighter aircraft are critical assets in national security and defence strategies. They are subject to stringent regulations concerning procurement, interoperability, and compliance with international treaties. The EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) emphasizes the importance of maintaining a robust fleet of fighter aircraft to ensure collective security among member states. Thus, understanding the regulatory implications surrounding fighter aircraft is essential for effective defence planning and operational readiness within the EU.",
