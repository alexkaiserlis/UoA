  "summary": "A \"primary election\" refers to a preliminary electoral procedure in which political parties select their candidates for subsequent general elections. Within the EU context, primary elections play a crucial role in enhancing democratic participation and ensuring that voters have a voice in candidate selection. These elections can vary significantly across member states, reflecting diverse electoral systems and party regulations. While not uniformly mandated by EU law, primary elections are increasingly recognized as a means to promote transparency and accountability within political parties. Their implementation may influence voter engagement and the overall electoral landscape in the EU.",
