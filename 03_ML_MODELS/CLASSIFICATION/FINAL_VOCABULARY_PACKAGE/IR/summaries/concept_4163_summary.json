  "summary": "The concept of \"pet food\" encompasses various agricultural activities related to the production and regulation of feeds for pets, including dogs and cats. In the EU, petfoods must adhere to strict legal standards concerning ingredients, such as colourants like azorubine and carmoisine, and additives like acidifiers and flavouring agents. Regulatory frameworks ensure the bioavailability of nutrients and the safety of components, including phosphorus and melamine, which must be monitored for potential insufficiency. The canning process often involves hermetically sealed cans to preserve quality. Additionally, sensory evaluations are conducted to assess the efficacy of formulations, ensuring that pet food products are both potent and appealing to pets.",
