  "summary": "The concept of \"generation gap,\" redirected to the preferred term \"conflict of generations,\" pertains to the disparities and tensions arising between different age cohorts, particularly in socio-economic and cultural contexts. Within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is significant as it influences policies related to employment, social inclusion, and intergenerational equity. The \"conflict of generations\" often manifests in legislative discussions surrounding pension reforms, youth unemployment, and educational opportunities, highlighting the need for balanced approaches that address the interests of both younger and older populations. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for developing effective EU policies that foster cohesion and mitigate potential conflicts.",
