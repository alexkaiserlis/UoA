  "summary": "Offshore drilling refers to the extraction of oil and gas resources from beneath the seabed, typically conducted in marine environments. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, offshore drilling is subject to stringent environmental assessments and compliance with directives aimed at protecting marine biodiversity and ensuring sustainable resource management. The EU has established regulations, such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, that mandate member states to monitor and manage the impacts of offshore drilling activities. These regulations are crucial for balancing energy needs with environmental protection, thereby promoting responsible practices within the oil industry sector.",
