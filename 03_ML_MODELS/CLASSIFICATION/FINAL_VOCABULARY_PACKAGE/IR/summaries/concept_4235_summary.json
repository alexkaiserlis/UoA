  "summary": "Price support refers to regulatory measures implemented by the European Union to stabilize or enhance the market prices of agricultural products. This concept is integral to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which aims to ensure fair income for farmers and maintain market equilibrium. Price support mechanisms can include direct payments, market interventions, and import tariffs, all designed to mitigate price volatility and protect producers from adverse market conditions. By establishing a framework for price support, the EU seeks to promote agricultural sustainability while balancing consumer interests and market competitiveness within the internal market.",
