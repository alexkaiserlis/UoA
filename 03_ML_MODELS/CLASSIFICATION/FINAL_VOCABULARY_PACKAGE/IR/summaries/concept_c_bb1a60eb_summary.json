  "summary": "The concept of \"environmental protection expenditure,\" redirected to the preferred term \"environmental cost,\" refers to financial outlays made by public authorities and private entities aimed at mitigating environmental degradation and promoting sustainability within the EU. This expenditure encompasses investments in pollution control, biodiversity conservation, and resource management, aligning with the EU's overarching environmental policy objectives. Legal frameworks, such as the European Green Deal, mandate the integration of environmental costs into economic assessments to ensure that sustainable practices are prioritized. By recognizing and quantifying these costs, the EU aims to foster accountability and enhance the effectiveness of environmental regulations across member states.",
