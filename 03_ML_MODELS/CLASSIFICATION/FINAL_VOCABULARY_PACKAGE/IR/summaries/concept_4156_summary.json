  "summary": "The \"stationing of forces\" refers to the deployment and positioning of military personnel and equipment within a specific territory, often governed by international agreements and national laws. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is crucial for ensuring collective defense and security cooperation among Member States. The stationing of forces may involve bilateral or multilateral treaties, which outline the legal status, responsibilities, and operational parameters of stationed troops. Such arrangements are essential for maintaining peace, enhancing military readiness, and facilitating joint operations, thereby reinforcing the EU's strategic autonomy and defense capabilities.",
