  "summary": "Economic cooperation within the EU framework emphasizes the importance of interregional collaboration, particularly in contexts such as the Mercosur agreement and relations with countries like Oman and Qatar. This cooperation aims to redress disparities and enhance community integration through various initiatives, including trade agreements and sensitization efforts. The EU's legal instruments endorse a multipronged approach that includes the facilitation of migrant flows and the promotion of sustainable development. By addressing attitudes towards economic challenges, the EU seeks to create formidable partnerships that translate into tangible benefits for member states and associated nations, such as those in the Belarussian and Arabian regions.",
