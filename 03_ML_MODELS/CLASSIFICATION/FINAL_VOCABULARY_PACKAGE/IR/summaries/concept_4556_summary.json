  "summary": "The term \"illicit worker\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"clandestine worker\" within the EU legal framework. Clandestine workers operate outside the formal labour market, often evading regulations and protections afforded to legitimate employees. This practice raises significant concerns regarding labour rights, taxation, and social security contributions. The EU has implemented various directives aimed at combating clandestine work, promoting fair labour practices, and ensuring compliance with employment laws. Addressing the issue of clandestine workers is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the labour market and protecting both workers and employers from the adverse effects of illicit employment practices.",
