  "summary": "The \"conscientious objection clause,\" also referred to as the \"conscience clause,\" is a legal provision within EU labour law and labour relations that allows individuals to refrain from participating in specific activities that conflict with their personal beliefs or moral convictions. This clause is particularly relevant in contexts such as healthcare, where professionals may refuse to perform certain procedures, like abortions or euthanasia, based on ethical grounds. The inclusion of a conscientious objection clause aims to balance individual rights with professional obligations, ensuring that personal convictions are respected while maintaining access to essential services.",
