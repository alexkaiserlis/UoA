  "summary": "The \"ship's passport\" is a crucial regulatory instrument within EU transport policy, designed to facilitate the navigation of vessels across navigable waterways. This certificate recognizes the fitness of a vessel and its crew, ensuring compliance with professional standards. By imposing stricter requirements on applicants, the ship's passport promotes uniformity in maritime operations, assisting boatmasters in safely navigating inland and coastal waters. The goal is to gradually harmonize regulations, reducing distortions in the carriage of passengers and goods. This model fosters reciprocal recognition among member states, enhancing the overall safety and efficiency of the maritime network while satisfying the diverse needs of the maritime community.",
