  "summary": "The concept of \"statutory power\" refers to the authority conferred by a statute, enabling entities, such as corporations and public bodies, to exercise specific functions within the EU legal framework. This power is crucial for enforcing compliance and ensuring that violations, such as infringements of regulatory statutes, are addressed through appropriate sanctions. Statutory powers facilitate expeditious inquiries into alleged violations, allowing for the detection of non-compliance and the imposition of pecuniary penalties, including fines. Furthermore, these powers enhance the supervisory role of institutions like the ECB and ESCB, ensuring that confidentiality and procedural integrity are maintained during investigations. Overall, statutory power is essential for safeguarding the reputation of financial systems and protecting households' interests.",
