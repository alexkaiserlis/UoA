  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"senior official\" is a redirect to \"civil servant,\" which encompasses individuals entrusted with executive power and public service roles. These officials are often involved in optimizing workplace practices and formalising policies that affect various sectors, including healthcare, where nurses and doctors play pivotal roles. The enactment of regulations may involve secondment arrangements, allowing civil servants to attend seminars and training sessions aimed at accelerating their specialization. As they navigate complex issues, such as corruption and electoral integrity, these officials are expected to appreciate the importance of transparency and accountability. Their responsibilities also include analyzing suggestions for improvement and ensuring that ties with external entities, like the ILO, are maintained.",
