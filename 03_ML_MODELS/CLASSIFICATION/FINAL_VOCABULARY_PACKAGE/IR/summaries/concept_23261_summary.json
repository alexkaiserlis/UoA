  "summary": "The term \"informal carer\" refers to individuals who provide unpaid care and support to family members or friends with health issues or disabilities. In EU legal and regulatory contexts, this concept is closely associated with social protection policies aimed at recognizing and supporting the vital role of carers in society. The preferred term \"carer\" encompasses both formal and informal caregivers, highlighting the need for comprehensive frameworks that address their rights and welfare. The EU emphasizes the importance of social inclusion and the provision of resources to enhance the quality of life for both carers and those they assist, ensuring equitable access to social protection mechanisms.",
