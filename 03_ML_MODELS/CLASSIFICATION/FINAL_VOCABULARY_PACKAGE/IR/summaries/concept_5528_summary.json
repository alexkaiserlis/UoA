  "summary": "The concept of \"tribal war,\" redirected to \"ethnic conflict,\" is vital in EU legal and regulatory frameworks addressing humanitarian crises. Such conflicts, often occurring in regions like Sudan and the Congo, involve vulnerable populations and can destabilise entire areas, as seen in Darfur. The EU's engagement through the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) aims to bridge gaps in multi-faceted responses, including humanitarian aid and democratic stabilisation efforts. Key players in these initiatives include overseas development funds (EDFs) and various envoy nominations. The EU actively manages these situations, ensuring that indicative measures are ratified to support affected regions, particularly in the Caribbean and Pacific.",
