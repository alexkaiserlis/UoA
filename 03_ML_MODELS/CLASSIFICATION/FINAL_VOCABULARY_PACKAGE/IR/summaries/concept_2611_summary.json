  "summary": "The concept of \"prevention of pollution\" within EU environmental policy encompasses a range of regulatory measures aimed at mitigating pollution sources. This includes addressing littering and wastage through innovative methods and promoting the use of compostable materials. The implementation of directives requires surveyors to assess uninspected areas prone to pollution, ensuring that unpolluted environments are maintained. The EU encourages biodegradable solutions and anaerobic processes to enhance biodegradation. Additionally, the concept spans various sectors, including maritime activities where warships must adhere to strict pollution controls. By centralising efforts and utilising iterative strategies, the EU aims to achieve a sustainable balance, preventing slicks and other pollutants from adversely affecting ecosystems.",
