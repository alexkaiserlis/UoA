This regulatory landscape aims to ensure equitable access to essential medicines while balancing the interests of public health and pharmaceutical innovation. The EU's approach involves collaboration among member states to establish transparent pricing mechanisms, often influenced by health technology assessments and economic evaluations. By harmonizing pricing strategies, the EU seeks to mitigate disparities in medicine availability and affordability, ultimately enhancing healthcare outcomes for its citizens while fostering a competitive market environment.",
