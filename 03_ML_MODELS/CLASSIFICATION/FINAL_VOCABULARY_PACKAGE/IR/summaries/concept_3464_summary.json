  "summary": "The concept of \"secondary residence\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to a dwelling that individuals occupy in addition to their primary residence. This classification is significant in various contexts, including taxation, social security, and demographic studies. Secondary residences can influence population statistics and urban planning, as they often reflect migration patterns and seasonal habitation trends. The EU's regulations may address the rights and obligations of individuals regarding their secondary residences, particularly in cross-border scenarios. Understanding this concept is essential for ensuring compliance with EU directives and for assessing the socio-economic impacts of population mobility.",
