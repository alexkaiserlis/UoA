  "summary": "The concept of \"housing need\" pertains to the essential demand for adequate and affordable housing within the European Union. It is a critical consideration in construction and town planning regulations, influencing policies aimed at ensuring sustainable urban development and social inclusion. The EU recognizes that addressing housing need is fundamental to achieving the objectives of the European Pillar of Social Rights, which emphasizes access to affordable housing as a key component of social welfare. Effective regulatory frameworks must assess housing need to facilitate the provision of sufficient housing stock, thereby promoting equitable living conditions across member states.",
