  "summary": "The term \"executive body\" refers to an entity within the framework of EU governance that possesses the authority to implement and enforce laws and policies. This concept is central to the exercise of executive power, which is distinct from legislative and judicial functions. In the EU context, executive bodies, such as the European Commission, are responsible for proposing legislation, managing the day-to-day affairs of the Union, and ensuring compliance with EU law. Their role is crucial in public service, as they facilitate the operationalization of EU directives and regulations, thereby contributing to the overall governance and regulatory landscape of the European Union.",
