  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the term \"tradesman\" is often redirected to the preferred term \"small retailer.\" This classification falls under the category of distributive trades, which encompasses entities engaged in the sale of goods directly to consumers. Small retailers play a crucial role in local economies, contributing to employment and community development. Regulatory measures affecting small retailers include compliance with consumer protection laws, taxation policies, and market access regulations. Understanding the distinction between \"tradesman\" and \"small retailer\" is essential for accurate legal interpretation and application within the EU's regulatory landscape.",
