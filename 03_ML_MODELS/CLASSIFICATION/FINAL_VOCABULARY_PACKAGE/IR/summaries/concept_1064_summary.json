  "summary": "The term \"protected forest,\" which redirects to \"classified forest,\" refers to areas designated under EU regulations to safeguard biodiversity, ecosystem services, and sustainable forestry practices. Classified forests are subject to specific legal frameworks aimed at conserving natural habitats and promoting environmental protection. These areas are integral to the EU's broader forestry policies, which emphasize sustainable management and the preservation of forest resources. By establishing classified forests, the EU aims to mitigate deforestation, enhance carbon sequestration, and maintain ecological balance. This regulatory approach underscores the importance of forests in combating climate change and supporting rural economies within the Union.",
