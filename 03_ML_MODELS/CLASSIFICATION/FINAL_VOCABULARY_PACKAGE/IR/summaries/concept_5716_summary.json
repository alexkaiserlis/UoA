  "summary": "The concept of \"skin disease\" encompasses various conditions affecting human skin, which are significant in the context of EU health regulations. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) oversees the approval of medicinal preparations, including herbal substances like hamamelis virginiana, for treating such diseases. Relevant directives establish requirements for the formulation and notification of medicinal products, ensuring they comply with established codes. Traditional herbal medicines must be documented and considered under specific measures, as outlined in official EU texts. The European Parliament has amended relevant regulations to enhance the functioning of these provisions, ensuring appropriate measures are implemented for public health.",
