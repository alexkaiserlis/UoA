  "summary": "The term \"UN subsidiary body\" refers to entities established by the United Nations to address specific issues, such as security and humanitarian affairs. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these bodies play a crucial role in implementing measures that align with the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). For instance, the UN Security Council (UNSC) may impose a ban on weapons or military assistance to certain nations, which the EU must then translate into uniform regulatory actions. These actions often involve restrictive measures, including the prohibition of financing or technical training for operators related to the prohibited activities. The EU, through its regulatory provisions, ensures that these resolutions are effectively implemented, thereby advancing international peace and security.",
