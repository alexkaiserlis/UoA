  "summary": "\"Political responsibility\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to the accountability of elected officials and public servants for their actions and decisions. This concept is pivotal in ensuring transparency and integrity in governance, as it mandates that politicians must answer for their policies and conduct. In the EU, political responsibility is often scrutinized through mechanisms such as parliamentary inquiries and public debates, which aim to uphold democratic principles. The enforcement of political responsibility is essential for maintaining public trust and ensuring that governance aligns with the rule of law and democratic values inherent in the EU's foundational treaties.",
