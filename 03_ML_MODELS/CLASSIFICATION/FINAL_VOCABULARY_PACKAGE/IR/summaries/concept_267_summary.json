  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"distribution cost\" refers to the aggregate expenses incurred in the delivery of goods, such as petroleum and alcohol, to consumers. These costs must be standardised to ensure compliance with prevailing regulations and to avoid anomalies that could lead to underconsumption or inconsistencies in market operations. Regulatory bodies often utilise questionnaires to collect data on distribution costs, enabling them to analyse trends and mobilise resources effectively. Monthly reports may reflect depreciation and adjustments, while appropriations are reserved for securing efficient delivery systems. This concept is crucial for allocating taxes and ensuring that all stakeholders bear their fair share of costs.",
