  "summary": "The \"grubbing-up grant,\" also known as the \"grubbing premium,\" is an EU financial inducement aimed at encouraging the abandonment of unharvested orchards or vineyards. This grant facilitates the relinquishment of land, allowing farmers to optimize their agricultural structures by replanting or reorganizing their groves. It addresses issues such as phylloxera infestations that destabilize production, and supports the transition to more viable crops, like nectarines or fortified wines. By providing financial assistance, the program aims to reduce the number of resting ares, enabling farmers to focus on more productive growings, thus enhancing the overall attractiveness of the agricultural sector.",
