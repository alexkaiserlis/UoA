  "summary": "Consumer credit refers to the financial products and services that allow individuals to borrow funds for personal use, typically involving the acquisition of goods or services. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, consumer credit is governed by various directives aimed at ensuring transparency, fairness, and protection for borrowers. Key regulations include the Consumer Credit Directive, which mandates clear information disclosure and responsible lending practices. The EU's approach emphasizes consumer rights, promoting informed decision-making and safeguarding against over-indebtedness. This regulatory landscape is essential for fostering trust in financial institutions and enhancing the overall stability of the credit market within the EU.",
