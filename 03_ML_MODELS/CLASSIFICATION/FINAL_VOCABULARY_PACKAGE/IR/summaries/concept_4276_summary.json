  "summary": "The concept of \"occupational status\" within the EU legal framework pertains to the classification of individuals based on their professional qualifications and responsibilities in various fields, including healthcare, teaching, and specialized medical areas such as oncology and paediatrics. This status plays a crucial role in regulating the insertion of trainees and specialists into the labour market, ensuring that they meet the necessary qualifications to respond to chronic diseases and systemic pathologies. The implications of occupational status are significant, as it justifies the need for regulated ordinances that govern medical professionals, including those involved in cancer screening and genetics. Over the past decade, the EU has seen a growing emphasis on distinct occupational roles, which automatically align with the responsibilities outlined in various legal documents, including bgbl and ombudsman reports.",
