  "summary": "The term \"prohibited weapon\" refers to arms and munitions that are explicitly banned under various EU legal frameworks, including international treaties and regulations aimed at arms control and disarmament. These weapons are deemed to pose excessive harm or indiscriminate effects, violating humanitarian principles. The European Union, through its Common Position on arms exports and other regulatory measures, seeks to prevent the proliferation of such weapons, ensuring compliance with international humanitarian law. The classification of a weapon as prohibited is crucial for maintaining security and stability within the EU and its member states, reflecting a commitment to ethical defense practices.",
