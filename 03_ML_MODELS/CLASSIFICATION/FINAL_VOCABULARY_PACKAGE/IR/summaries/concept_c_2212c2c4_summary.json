  "summary": "The concept of \"multilevel policy,\" redirected to \"multi-level governance,\" is pivotal in EU legal and regulatory frameworks. It encapsulates the intricate interplay between various governance levels—local, regional, national, and supranational—within the European Union. This governance model emphasizes the distribution of authority and responsibility across these layers, facilitating coherent policy-making and implementation. By fostering collaboration among diverse stakeholders, multi-level governance enhances democratic legitimacy and accountability. It is essential for addressing complex transnational issues, ensuring that policies are responsive to the needs of diverse populations while adhering to overarching EU objectives. This concept is integral to understanding EU regulatory dynamics.",
