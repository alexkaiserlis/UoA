  "summary": "In the context of EU budgetary regulations, \"advance\" refers to a preliminary payment made to beneficiaries, such as fishing and aquaculture sectors, to support planned activities. This funding is often lodged in instalments, allowing officials to quickly reimburse incurred costs. Advances are crucial during crises, enabling immediate support while compliance with scheduled inspections and commitments is ensured. The desired outcome is to facilitate the launch of projects, with the ceiling on advances carefully monitored. In the meantime, electronic systems are employed for the sensing and forwarding of requests, ensuring that all parties qualify for reimbursement under the established calendar of payments.",
