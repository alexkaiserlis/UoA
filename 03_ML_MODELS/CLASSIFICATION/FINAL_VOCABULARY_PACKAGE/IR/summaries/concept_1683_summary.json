  "summary": "The concept of \"littoral\" pertains to coastal areas and is significant in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly regarding Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). This approach addresses the degradation of landscapes and ecosystems, emphasizing sustainable practices to combat issues like piracy and environmental repression in regions such as Somalia. The EU's sectorial policies, including those related to maritime security, often involve contributions from various stakeholders, including naval commanders and environmental experts like Giovanni and Philip. Legal instruments may include provisions for disbursement of funds and decentralised governance to enhance cooperation among member states, thereby ensuring effective management of littoral zones.",
