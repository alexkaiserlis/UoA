  "summary": "The \"ECSC levy\" refers to a financial mechanism established under the Treaty of Paris, obliging member states of the European Communities to contribute a fixed portion of their coal and steel production revenues. This levy, adjusted annually, aims to support the budgetary expenditure of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). The Commission is tasked with examining the economic situation and assessing whether the levies are sufficient to cover the community's financial needs. Following changes in production figures, an annual report is submitted to the Council, providing justification for any adjustments and ensuring transparency in the application of the levy.",
