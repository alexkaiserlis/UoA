  "summary": "The concept of \"national tariff\" within the EU transport policy framework refers to the pricing structure established by individual member states for transport services. These tariffs are crucial for regulating the financial aspects of transport operations, ensuring compliance with both national and EU regulations. National tariffs can influence market competition and consumer access to transport services, as they determine the costs associated with various modes of transport. The EU encourages harmonization of these tariffs to promote a cohesive internal market while allowing member states the flexibility to address local economic conditions. Thus, national tariffs play a pivotal role in the broader context of EU transport policy.",
