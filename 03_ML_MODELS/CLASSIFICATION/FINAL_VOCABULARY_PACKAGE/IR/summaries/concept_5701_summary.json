  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the term \"threatened language\" is a redirect to \"minority language,\" which encompasses languages spoken by smaller populations within member states. The EU recognizes the importance of preserving minority languages as part of cultural heritage and diversity. Legal instruments, such as the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, aim to protect these languages from extinction by promoting their use in education, media, and public life. The EU's commitment to linguistic diversity underscores the necessity of safeguarding threatened languages to foster social cohesion and respect for cultural identities across Europe.",
