  "summary": "Worker consultation is a fundamental aspect of EU labour law, aimed at ensuring that employees are adequately informed and involved in decisions affecting their employment and working conditions. This process emanates from the recognition of workers' rights, safeguarding their interests during significant changes such as mergers or insolvencies. It prevails over mere employer discretion, fostering a supportive environment that enhances employability and adaptability. In contexts like bankruptcies or redundancy, effective consultation can mitigate pressures on employees, ensuring their voices are heard. Moreover, it addresses inequalities related to race, creed, and sex, striving for a decent workplace for all professions, including seafarers.",
