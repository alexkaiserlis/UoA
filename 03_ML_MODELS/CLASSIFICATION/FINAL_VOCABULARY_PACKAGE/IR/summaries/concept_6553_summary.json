  "summary": "The term \"child pornography\" refers to any visual representation of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor, which is strictly prohibited under EU law. The European Union has established comprehensive legal frameworks, including the Directive 2011/92/EU, aimed at combating sexual exploitation and abuse of children. This regulatory framework mandates member states to criminalize the possession, distribution, and production of child pornography. The EU emphasizes the importance of cooperation among member states to enhance enforcement and protect children from exploitation. The legal definitions and penalties associated with child pornography are crucial for safeguarding minors and ensuring a unified approach across the EU.",
