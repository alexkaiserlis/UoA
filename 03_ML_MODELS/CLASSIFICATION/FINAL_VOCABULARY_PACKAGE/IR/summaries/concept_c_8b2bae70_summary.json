  "summary": "\"Sea level rise\" refers to the gradual increase in ocean levels due to climate change, primarily driven by the melting of polar ice caps and thermal expansion of seawater. Within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this phenomenon is recognized as a critical aspect of environmental deterioration, necessitating comprehensive policy responses. The EU's climate adaptation strategies, such as the European Climate Law, aim to mitigate the impacts of sea level rise on coastal ecosystems and human settlements. Effective management of this issue requires collaboration among member states to ensure sustainable development and compliance with environmental protection directives, thereby safeguarding vulnerable regions against the adverse effects of rising sea levels.",
