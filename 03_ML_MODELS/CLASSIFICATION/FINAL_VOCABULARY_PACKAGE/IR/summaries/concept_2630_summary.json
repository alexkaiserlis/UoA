  "summary": "The term \"political prisoner\" refers to individuals detained for their political beliefs, actions, or affiliations, often in violation of fundamental human rights. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the designation of a political prisoner can invoke scrutiny under international law and human rights conventions. The EU actively engages in monitoring and addressing cases of political imprisonment, advocating for the rule of law and the protection of civil liberties. This concept is crucial in discussions surrounding political repression and the EU's commitment to uphold democratic values, influencing diplomatic relations and sanctions against regimes that violate these principles.",
