  "summary": "A \"supplementary budget\" in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to an additional financial plan that adjusts the original budget to accommodate unforeseen expenditures or changes in revenue. This mechanism allows the European Union to respond flexibly to emerging needs, such as economic crises or urgent policy initiatives. The supplementary budget is proposed by the European Commission and requires approval from the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. It ensures that the EU can maintain fiscal stability while addressing pressing challenges, thereby enhancing the overall efficacy of its budgetary governance.",
