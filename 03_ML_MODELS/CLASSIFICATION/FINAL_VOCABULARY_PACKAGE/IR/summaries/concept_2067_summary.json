  "summary": "The concept of \"budgetary classification\" pertains to the systematic categorization of public finance and budget policy within the European Union's regulatory framework. It serves as a critical tool for ensuring transparency and accountability in the allocation and management of financial resources. By delineating expenditures and revenues into distinct categories, budgetary classification facilitates effective fiscal planning and monitoring, aligning with the EU's broader economic governance objectives. This classification system is essential for harmonizing national budgets with EU financial regulations, thereby promoting coherence in budgetary practices across member states and enhancing the overall integrity of the EU's financial management.",
