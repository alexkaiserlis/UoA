  "summary": "The concept of \"EU-NATO cooperation\" encompasses the collaborative efforts between the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, aimed at enhancing security and defense within Europe. This partnership is crucial for addressing contemporary security challenges, including hybrid threats and crisis management. Legal and regulatory frameworks underpinning this cooperation facilitate joint military operations, intelligence sharing, and strategic planning. The synergy between the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and NATO's collective defense principles exemplifies the commitment to a cohesive security architecture. As a redirect, \"NATO-EU cooperation\" aligns with the preferred term \"EU-NATO cooperation,\" reflecting the evolving dynamics of transatlantic relations.",
