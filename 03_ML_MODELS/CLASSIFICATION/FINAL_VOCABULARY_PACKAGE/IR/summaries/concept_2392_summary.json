  "summary": "The Colombo Plan, established in 1950, is a regional intergovernmental organization aimed at fostering economic and social development in Asia and the Pacific. While not a direct EU institution, its objectives align with the EU's commitment to international cooperation and sustainable development. The Plan facilitates collaboration among member states on various issues, including poverty alleviation and capacity building. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the Colombo Plan underscores the importance of multilateral partnerships and regional integration, which are essential for addressing transnational challenges and promoting stability in the region, thereby complementing the EU's external action policies.",
