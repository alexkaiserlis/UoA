  "summary": "A \"pedestrian zone\" refers to a designated area within urban environments where vehicle access is restricted or entirely prohibited, thereby prioritizing pedestrian movement and enhancing public safety. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, pedestrian zones are often established through local town planning regulations, aimed at improving urban livability and reducing environmental impacts. These zones may be subject to specific construction guidelines to ensure accessibility and aesthetic coherence. The implementation of pedestrian zones is supported by various EU directives promoting sustainable urban development, encouraging member states to adopt measures that facilitate non-motorized transport and enhance urban spaces for citizens.",
