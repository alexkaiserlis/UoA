  "summary": "Greenwashing refers to the deceptive practice where companies falsely promote their products or services as environmentally friendly, thereby misleading consumers regarding their actual sustainability credentials. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, greenwashing undermines the integrity of marketing practices and consumer trust. The European Commission has initiated various measures to combat this phenomenon, including the proposed Green Claims Directive, which aims to ensure that environmental claims are substantiated and transparent. This regulatory scrutiny is essential for fostering genuine sustainability efforts and protecting consumers from misleading marketing tactics that could distort market competition.",
