  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"migratory bird\" redirects to the preferred term \"bird,\" encompassing various species, including phalacrocorax and psittacidae. These birds are crucial for maintaining ecological balance and are often studied in ornithological symposiums. The EU recognizes the importance of migratory flyways, which are vital for species survival and biodiversity. Regulations address issues such as the impact of guano on ecosystems and the transmission of diseases like echinococcosis and coccidiosis among waterfowl. Moreover, the extinction of certain species due to pandemics and environmental changes necessitates stringent certification processes to monitor and protect these avian populations effectively.",
