  "summary": "The term \"expatriate worker\" refers to individuals who reside outside their country of origin while engaging in employment in a host nation. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, expatriate workers are subject to various directives that govern labor mobility, social security coordination, and employment rights. The EU aims to facilitate the free movement of workers, ensuring that expatriate workers can access equal treatment in terms of working conditions and social benefits. This concept is crucial for understanding labor market dynamics within the EU, particularly in relation to cross-border employment and the integration of diverse labor forces.",
