  "summary": "A sovereign wealth fund (SWF) is a state-owned investment vehicle that manages national savings for the purpose of generating long-term returns. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, SWFs are subject to scrutiny under various financial regulations to ensure transparency, accountability, and compliance with international standards. The European Union recognizes the significance of SWFs in global financial markets, particularly regarding their impact on investment flows and economic stability. Regulatory measures may include guidelines on governance structures and reporting obligations, aimed at mitigating risks associated with sovereign investments while fostering sustainable economic development within the EU.",
