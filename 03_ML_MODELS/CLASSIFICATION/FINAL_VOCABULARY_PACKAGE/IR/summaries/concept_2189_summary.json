  "summary": "The term \"international organisation,\" a preferred term in EU legal and regulatory contexts, encompasses entities that operate bilaterally or plurilaterally, succeeding in fostering cooperation among states. These organisations often embodying philosophical and confessional diversity, engage in various domains, including health, where issues like malaria and HIV are addressed. They serve as depositories for treaties and pledges, facilitating the regularised exchange of information among member states. Lobbyists and stakeholders, stationed in these organisations, navigate complex topographies of international law, addressing friction in negotiations. The inaugural meetings in cities like Genova and Okinawa reflect their commitment to open dialogue, while cabinets of member states work collaboratively to realign priorities and tackle global challenges.",
