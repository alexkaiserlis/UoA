  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"incompatibility\" refers to situations where certain roles, positions, or actions are deemed mutually exclusive under specific regulations. This concept is particularly relevant within the parliamentary domain, where it ensures that members of the European Parliament (MEPs) do not hold conflicting interests that could undermine their duties. Incompatibility provisions are designed to uphold the integrity of parliamentary functions, preventing potential conflicts of interest and ensuring that MEPs act in the public interest. Such regulations are crucial for maintaining trust in democratic institutions and promoting transparent governance within the EU.",
