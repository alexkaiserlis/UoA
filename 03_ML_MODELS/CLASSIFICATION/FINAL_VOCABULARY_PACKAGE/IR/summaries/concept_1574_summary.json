  "summary": "Homogenized milk, referred to in EU legal and regulatory frameworks as \"homogenised milk,\" is classified under the category of processed agricultural produce (6016). This term encompasses milk that has undergone a mechanical process to break down fat globules, ensuring a uniform consistency and preventing cream separation. The EU regulations governing homogenized milk focus on quality standards, labeling requirements, and safety protocols to protect consumer health and ensure fair market practices. As a redirect term, \"homogenized milk\" leads to the preferred term \"homogenised milk,\" which is consistently used in EU documentation to maintain clarity and compliance across member states.",
