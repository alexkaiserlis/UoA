  "summary": "The concept of \"stubble,\" categorized under the deterioration of the environment, is redirected to the preferred term \"agricultural waste.\" In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, agricultural waste encompasses various residues, including stubble, which can lead to environmental concerns such as the pollute of watersheds through effluents and the improper management of proteinaceous materials. Effective practices like composting and sterilization are essential to mitigate issues related to denitrification and the dispersal of harmful substances. The empirical management of stubble, including burial and incineration, is crucial for sustainable agriculture, particularly in regions like Saxonia and Thuringia, where pasturage and cropped acreage are significant. Addressing unanswered questions about the impact of lards and tallow on soil health is vital for future agricultural practices.",
