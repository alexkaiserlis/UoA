  "summary": "The term \"national liberation movement\" refers to organized efforts aimed at achieving self-determination and independence for a specific national, ethnic, or cultural group. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such movements may intersect with international law principles, particularly regarding human rights and self-determination. The EU often engages with national liberation movements through diplomatic channels, assessing their legitimacy and the implications for regional stability. While the EU promotes democratic values, it must balance these with its commitment to territorial integrity of member states, making the recognition of such movements a complex legal and political issue within international affairs.",
