  "summary": "The \"Troika\" refers to the collaborative framework established by the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, primarily aimed at addressing financial crises within member states. This triadic structure facilitates the coordination of economic policies and the implementation of stringent fiscal measures to ensure stability and compliance with EU regulations. The Troika's interventions often involve the provision of financial assistance contingent upon the adoption of comprehensive reform programs, thereby reinforcing the EU's commitment to economic governance and sustainable development. This mechanism underscores the intricate relationship between economic oversight and regulatory compliance in the EU context.",
