  "summary": "The \"single common market organisation,\" redirecting to the preferred term \"common organisation of markets,\" is a fundamental component of EU agricultural policy. It aims to eliminate discriminations among member states, facilitating the free movement of goods and services. This framework addresses imbalances in market access, particularly for nonmember countries, and ensures that agricultural products, such as heifers and herbaceous plants, are adequately regulated. By establishing contracts and applicable regulations, it supports storekeepers and producers in managing their preparations. The organisation typifies a collective effort to optimize market efficiency, economizing resources while preventing swamping of local markets.",
