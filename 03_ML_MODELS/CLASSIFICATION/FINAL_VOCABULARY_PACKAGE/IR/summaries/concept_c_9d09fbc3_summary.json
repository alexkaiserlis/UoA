Within the EU legal framework, combating terrorism financing is crucial for ensuring public safety and maintaining political stability. The EU has implemented various regulations and directives aimed at preventing the misuse of financial systems for terrorist purposes, including stringent measures for monitoring and reporting suspicious transactions.
