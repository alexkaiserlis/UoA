  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"transport undertaking,\" redirected to \"transport company,\" encompasses various entities engaged in the organization and provision of transport services. These companies, attuned to the complexities of cross-border traffic, operate across multiple routes, such as those connecting ports like Travemuende and Trelleborg or air carriers like Swissair and Corsair. Notably, firms like Stena and SNCM exemplify the diversity within this sector, facilitating trade and passenger movement through hubs like Europort and Göteborg. Regulatory frameworks ensure that these transport companies comply with standards, fostering competition and safety, while also addressing issues related to environmental impact and market access, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of transport networks across Europe.",
