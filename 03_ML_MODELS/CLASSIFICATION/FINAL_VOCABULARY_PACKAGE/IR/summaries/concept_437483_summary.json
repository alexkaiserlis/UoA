  "summary": "The \"Common Frame of Reference\" (CFR) is a pivotal concept in EU civil law, aimed at harmonizing private law across Member States. It serves as a comprehensive framework that outlines fundamental principles and rules applicable to various legal areas, including contract law and tort law. The CFR facilitates legal certainty and predictability, promoting cross-border transactions and enhancing consumer protection. By providing a uniform set of standards, the CFR seeks to reduce legal fragmentation within the EU, thereby fostering a more integrated internal market. Its development reflects the EU's commitment to creating a cohesive legal environment that supports economic cooperation and social justice.",
