  "summary": "Inter-parliamentary cooperation within the European Union (EU) refers to the collaborative efforts among national parliaments and the European Parliament to enhance legislative effectiveness and democratic accountability. This cooperation facilitates the exchange of information and best practices, fostering a cohesive approach to EU governance. It is particularly significant in the context of the subsidiarity principle, ensuring that decisions are made at the most appropriate level. Through mechanisms such as the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union (COSAC), inter-parliamentary cooperation strengthens the role of parliaments in scrutinizing EU legislation, thus reinforcing the democratic legitimacy of the Union.",
