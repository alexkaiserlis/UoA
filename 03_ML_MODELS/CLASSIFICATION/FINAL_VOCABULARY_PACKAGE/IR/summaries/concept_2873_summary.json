  "summary": "The term \"underclass,\" redirected to \"socially disadvantaged class,\" refers to a segment of the population facing systemic barriers that impede their social and economic mobility. In EU legal and regulatory contexts, this concept is crucial for understanding social inclusion policies and frameworks aimed at addressing inequality. The socially disadvantaged class often experiences marginalization, limited access to resources, and reduced participation in societal activities. EU initiatives, such as the European Social Fund, aim to alleviate the challenges faced by this group, promoting equal opportunities and fostering social cohesion across member states. This term underscores the EU's commitment to combating poverty and social exclusion.",
