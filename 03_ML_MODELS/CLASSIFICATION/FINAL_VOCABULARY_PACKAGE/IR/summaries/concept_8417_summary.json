  "summary": "Complicity, within the framework of EU criminal law, refers to the legal principle where an individual assists or contributes to the commission of a crime, thereby sharing culpability. This concept encompasses various forms of involvement, including aiding, abetting, or inciting criminal acts. In EU regulatory contexts, complicity is significant for establishing liability in transnational crimes, particularly in areas such as organized crime and terrorism. The legal ramifications of complicity necessitate a nuanced understanding of the roles individuals play in criminal enterprises, influencing both prosecution strategies and judicial outcomes across member states.",
