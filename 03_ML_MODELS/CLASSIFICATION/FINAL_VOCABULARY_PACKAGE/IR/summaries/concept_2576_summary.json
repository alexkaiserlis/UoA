  "summary": "The \"power of assessment\" refers to the authority vested in EU institutions to evaluate compliance with legal and regulatory frameworks. This concept is crucial within the political framework of the EU, as it underpins the mechanisms for monitoring member states' adherence to EU law. The power of assessment enables the European Commission to conduct evaluations and audits, ensuring that policies are implemented effectively and that member states fulfill their obligations. This evaluative capacity is essential for maintaining the integrity of the EU's legal order, fostering accountability, and facilitating informed decision-making in the legislative process.",
