The EU's environmental policies, such as the Habitats Directive, aim to protect these fragile environments from degradation and promote sustainable land use practices. Understanding the regulatory implications of desert areas is crucial for environmental assessments and land management strategies within the EU, ensuring that the ecological integrity of these regions is maintained in the face of climate change and human activity.",
