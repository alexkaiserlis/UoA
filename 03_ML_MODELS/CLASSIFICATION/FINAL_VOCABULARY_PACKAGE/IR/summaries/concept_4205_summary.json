  "summary": "Sociology, categorized under the humanities, plays a crucial role in understanding the societal dynamics that influence EU legal and regulatory frameworks. It examines the intricate relationships between individuals, groups, and institutions, providing insights into social behavior and cultural norms. This understanding is essential for policymakers and regulators as they craft legislation that reflects the diverse needs of EU citizens. By integrating sociological perspectives, the EU can enhance its regulatory approaches, ensuring they are responsive to societal changes and fostering social cohesion. Ultimately, sociology informs the development of laws that promote equality, justice, and democratic values within the EU.",
