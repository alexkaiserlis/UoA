  "summary": "The concept of \"image\" within the context of EU politics and public safety encompasses the representation and perception of entities, policies, and actions in the public domain. It plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and influencing regulatory frameworks. The EU employs various legal instruments to manage how images are disseminated, particularly in relation to transparency, accountability, and the protection of individual rights. The regulation of image-related content is essential for maintaining public trust and ensuring that political communication adheres to ethical standards. Thus, the concept of \"image\" is integral to the broader discourse on governance and civic engagement in the EU.",
