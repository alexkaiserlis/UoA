  "summary": "The term \"Newly Independent States\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"Commonwealth of Independent States\" (CIS), which encompasses a group of former Soviet republics that gained sovereignty following the dissolution of the USSR. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the CIS plays a significant role in regional cooperation and geopolitical stability. The EU engages with these states through various agreements aimed at fostering economic collaboration, political dialogue, and adherence to international law. Understanding the dynamics of the CIS is essential for EU policymakers in shaping external relations and promoting democratic governance in the region.",
