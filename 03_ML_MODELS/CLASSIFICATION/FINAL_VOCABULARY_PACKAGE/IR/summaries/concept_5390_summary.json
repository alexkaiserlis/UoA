  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"dependent relative\" is synonymous with \"dependant,\" which serves as the preferred term in relevant documentation. This concept pertains to individuals who rely on a primary family member for financial support or care, often influencing eligibility for various social benefits and immigration rights within EU member states. The classification of a \"dependant\" is crucial in determining family reunification policies and social welfare entitlements. Understanding this term is essential for compliance with EU regulations that govern family rights and social security frameworks, ensuring that dependants receive appropriate recognition and protection under EU law.",
