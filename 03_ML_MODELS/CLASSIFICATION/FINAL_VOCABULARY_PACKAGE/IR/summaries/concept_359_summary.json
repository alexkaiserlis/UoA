  "summary": "Decolonisation refers to the process through which former colonies gain independence and sovereignty, a concept of significant relevance in international affairs and EU legal frameworks. The EU has engaged in various initiatives promoting decolonisation, particularly through development aid and diplomatic relations with former colonies. This process is crucial for addressing historical injustices and fostering equitable partnerships. Although \"decolonization\" is a common term, the preferred term in EU contexts is \"decolonisation,\" reflecting the EU's commitment to linguistic precision. The legal implications of decolonisation involve international law, human rights, and the promotion of self-determination, aligning with the EU's foundational principles.",
