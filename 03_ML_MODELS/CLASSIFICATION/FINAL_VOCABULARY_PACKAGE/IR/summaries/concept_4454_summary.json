  "summary": "The concept of \"tea\" (6006 plant product) encompasses various infusions derived from the Camellia sinensis plant, often consumed for their dietetic benefits. In EU regulatory frameworks, tea is subject to strict controls regarding pesticide residues, with Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) established for substances like triadimephon, pyraclostrobine, and linuron. The toxicologically acceptable intakes of these pesticides are critical for consumer safety, particularly for vulnerable groups such as travellers and those with allergies. Additionally, tea extracts and concentrates may be evaluated for their health claims, including potential benefits in remission and overall well-being. The regulatory landscape ensures that all products, including roasted and granulated forms, meet safety standards for public health.",
