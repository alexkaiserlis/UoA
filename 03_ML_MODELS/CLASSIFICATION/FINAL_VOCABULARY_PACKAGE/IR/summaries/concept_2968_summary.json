  "summary": "Administrative reform within the EU context refers to the systematic changes aimed at enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of public service and executive power. This process often involves the incorporation of multilingual and multicultural approaches, ensuring that expatriates and officials can perform their responsibilities in a neutral environment. Reforms may include the restructuring of posts, the introduction of statutory regulations, and the establishment of competitions for selecting assistants and auditors. These changes are designed to promote trust and transparency, while also ensuring that the privileges and immunities of elected representatives are preserved. Ultimately, administrative reform seeks to create a more accountable and responsive public administration.",
