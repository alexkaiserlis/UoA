  "summary": "The concept of \"farm animal\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses various species, including suidae and solipeds, that are integral to agricultural production. Regulations aim to ensure well-structured animal welfare standards, addressing issues such as residency, vaccination, and the prevention of zoonotic diseases like brucella and echinococcosis. Notably, the use of hormones, including trenbolone and zeranol, is strictly regulated to mitigate health risks. The occurrence of parasites, such as trichinella and spiralis, in livestock is monitored to protect both animal and human immunity. Additionally, transhumance practices are regulated to maintain animal health across regions, including areas like Yambol and Shumen. The EU emphasizes the importance of tagging and notifying authorities about animal movements to ensure compliance with health standards and facilitate effective management of wildlife interactions.",
