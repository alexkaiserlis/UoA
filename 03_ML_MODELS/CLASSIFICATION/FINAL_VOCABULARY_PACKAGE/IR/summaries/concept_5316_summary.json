  "summary": "The concept of \"tropical forest\" is crucial within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning biodiversity conservation and sustainable forestry practices. Tropical forests, characterized by their rich biodiversity and complex ecosystems, are subject to various EU directives aimed at environmental protection, such as the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive. These regulations emphasize the importance of preserving these ecosystems to combat deforestation and promote sustainable land use. The EU also engages in international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, to address climate change impacts on tropical forests, thereby ensuring their protection and sustainable management for future generations.",
