  "summary": "The \"announcement of candidacy\" is a crucial step in the electoral procedure within the EU, entailing the formal submission of a nomination by candidates seeking elected positions. This process is governed by regulations that ensure the admissibility of candidates, preventing disqualification based on specific barriers such as residency requirements. Citizens residing in EU member states can propose their candidacy, which must be accompanied by an attestation confirming their eligibility. The announcement serves to inform the electorate, facilitating the exercise of the vote. It is essential for ensuring representation and upholding democratic principles as outlined in the Lisbon Treaty, thereby designating candidates who embody the interests of nationals.",
