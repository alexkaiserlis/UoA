  "summary": "Unsolicited electronic advertising, commonly referred to as spam, is a significant concern within EU legal frameworks, particularly under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the ePrivacy Directive. These regulations establish stringent requirements for consent prior to the dissemination of marketing communications. The concept encompasses various forms of electronic messages, including emails and text messages, that are sent without prior consent from the recipient. The EU aims to protect consumers from intrusive marketing practices, ensuring that individuals have control over their personal data and the communications they receive. Non-compliance can lead to substantial penalties, reinforcing the importance of adhering to these regulations.",
