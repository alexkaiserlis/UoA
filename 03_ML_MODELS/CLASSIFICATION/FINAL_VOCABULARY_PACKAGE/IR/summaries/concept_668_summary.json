  "summary": "The \"science of education,\" as a redirect to the preferred term \"education,\" encompasses various EU initiatives aimed at reforming and optimising educational frameworks. Programs like Comenius, Leonardo, and Socrates focus on enhancing employability and fostering creativity among students. The ISCED framework supports longitudinal studies to assess educational outcomes, while the UOE and UIS databases provide vital data for decision-making. By harnessing entrepreneurial skills and promoting adaptability, the EU aims to cater to diverse learning domains and address educational deprivation. This decentralised approach facilitates cofinancing and boosts community engagement, ultimately honouring the principles of lifelong learning and entrepreneurship across Europe.",
