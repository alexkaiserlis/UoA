  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"insurance undertaking,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"insurance company,\" refers to entities that provide coverage against risks, thereby underpinning financial stability. These insurers are subject to rigorous scrutiny by supervisors, ensuring compliance with solvency requirements and empowering them to operate effectively within the market. The regulatory framework includes provisions for reinsurance and retrocession, allowing for risk diversification. Additionally, addendums to policies must be meticulously documented to avoid distortive practices. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) plays a crucial role in overseeing these companies, promoting a liberalized market while addressing inequalities and ensuring consumer protection.",
