  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"squid\" is classified under the broader term \"mollusc,\" reflecting its significance in fisheries management. This redirect emphasizes the importance of molluscan species, including opalescens and pecten, which are subject to various regulations to mitigate risks such as listeriosis and diarrhoeic outbreaks. Regulatory frameworks address disturbances in marine ecosystems, ensuring sustainable practices in aquaculture, including Ã©levage of bivalves like moules and queenies. The adoption of measures against toxins, such as domoic acid linked to amnesic shellfish poisoning, is crucial. Additionally, demarcations of fishing zones, like those in the baie of Cleddau and loughmore, are vital for preserving species like paralichthys olivaceus and maintaining biodiversity in insularum regions.",
