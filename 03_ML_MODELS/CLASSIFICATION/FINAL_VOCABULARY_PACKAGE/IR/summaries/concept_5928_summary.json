  "summary": "\"Dual-use technology\" refers to items, software, or technology that can be utilized for both civilian and military applications. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is critical for ensuring that such technologies do not contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or enhance military capabilities in a manner that undermines international security. The EU implements stringent export controls and licensing requirements for dual-use items, governed by regulations that aim to balance technological advancement with ethical considerations and global stability. Compliance with these regulations is essential for entities engaged in the development or trade of dual-use technologies within the EU.",
