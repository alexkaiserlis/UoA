  "summary": "Tax exemption refers to the legal provision allowing certain entities or individuals to be relieved from the obligation of paying taxes, thereby promoting economic activities akin to hospitality and development. In the EU, this principle is crucial for sectors like healthcare, where dentists and technicians may benefit from exemptions on specific services or products, such as prostheses or deodorisers. Additionally, tax exemptions can apply to industries like hydroelectric energy or amusement, fostering innovation and reducing adverse impacts on businesses. Legal frameworks often require careful estimation of the economic implications, ensuring that such exemptions do not lead to inoperability in tax systems or unfair advantages for certain developers or sectors.",
