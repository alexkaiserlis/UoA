  "summary": "The \"geophysical environment\" refers to the physical aspects of the Earth’s structure and processes, including geological formations, soil types, and natural resources. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, understanding the geophysical environment is crucial for environmental protection, land use planning, and sustainable development. Regulations such as the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive emphasize the need to assess the effects of projects on the geophysical environment to mitigate adverse impacts. Additionally, the EU’s commitment to biodiversity and climate change adaptation necessitates a comprehensive understanding of geophysical factors influencing ecosystems and human activities, ensuring informed policymaking and regulatory compliance.",
