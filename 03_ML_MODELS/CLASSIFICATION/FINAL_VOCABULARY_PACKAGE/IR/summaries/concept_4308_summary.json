  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"hazardous substance,\" redirected to \"dangerous substance,\" encompasses a range of materials that pose significant risks to health and the environment. This includes neurotoxicological agents like benzidine and trichloroethylene, which can lead to serious health issues, including amnesic symptoms. The regulation of such substances necessitates reevaluation processes, ensuring that communities are protected from exposure to harmful compounds like polybrominatedbiphenyls and chlorosilanes. The EU framework emphasizes the importance of childresistant packaging for products containing these substances, while also addressing the risks associated with dustable materials like amosite and actinolite. Regulatory measures aim to mitigate the slowness of response to emerging threats, ensuring that antidotes are available for specific toxic exposures.",
