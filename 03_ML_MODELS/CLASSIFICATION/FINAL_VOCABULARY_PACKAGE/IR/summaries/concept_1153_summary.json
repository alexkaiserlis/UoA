This discipline is increasingly relevant as the EU faces demographic shifts, necessitating policies that address the health needs of older adults. Legal documents may reference gerontology in relation to healthcare regulations, social services, and age-related research funding. The EU's commitment to enhancing the quality of life for its aging citizens is reflected in initiatives aimed at promoting healthy aging, ensuring access to geriatric care, and fostering environments conducive to the well-being of older individuals.",
