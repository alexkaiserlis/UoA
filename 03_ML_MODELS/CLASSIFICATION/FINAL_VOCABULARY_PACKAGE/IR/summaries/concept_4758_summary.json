  "summary": "Compulsory voting refers to a legal requirement for eligible citizens to participate in elections, thereby enhancing electoral participation and democratic legitimacy. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, compulsory voting is not uniformly mandated across member states, leading to diverse electoral procedures. While some countries implement sanctions for non-participation, others advocate for voluntary engagement. The European Union encourages member states to adopt measures that promote voter turnout, yet it respects national sovereignty in determining electoral laws. This concept underscores the balance between individual civic duty and state-imposed obligations in the democratic process.",
