  "summary": "The term \"manual worker\" refers to individuals engaged in physical labor, typically involving hands-on tasks that require skill and effort. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, manual workers are often addressed in labor market policies, collective bargaining agreements, and health and safety regulations. These workers play a crucial role in various sectors, including construction, manufacturing, and agriculture. The EU emphasizes the protection of manual workers' rights, ensuring fair wages, safe working conditions, and access to social security. This concept is integral to discussions on labor mobility, employment standards, and the overall functioning of the labor market within the EU.",
