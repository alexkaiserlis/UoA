  "summary": "Hazardous waste refers to materials that pose significant risks to human health and the environment, necessitating stringent regulatory frameworks within the EU. Such waste can include items crafted with hazardous substances like hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) and phthalates, which are prevalent in electronic and architectural applications. The EU's Waste Framework Directive mandates the proper classification and disposal of hazardous waste, often requiring recyclers to manage materials like plasticised components and capacitors safely. Incinerators and landfills must adhere to regulations to prevent the emission of undesired pollutants, while innovative technologies such as tomography and digitizers aid in the solidification and requalification of waste.",
