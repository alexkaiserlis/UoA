  "summary": "The concept of \"obstetrics\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks is redirected to \"gynaecology,\" which encompasses the broader field of women's reproductive health. This relationship highlights the regulatory focus on ensuring comprehensive healthcare standards for maternal and reproductive health across member states. In EU legislation, gynaecology is pivotal in addressing health policies, medical practices, and patient rights, particularly regarding prenatal care and childbirth. The harmonization of these regulations aims to enhance healthcare quality and accessibility, ensuring that all women receive adequate obstetric care. Thus, understanding this redirect is essential for navigating health-related legal documents within the EU context.",
