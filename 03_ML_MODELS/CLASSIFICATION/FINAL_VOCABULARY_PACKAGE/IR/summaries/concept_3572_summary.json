  "summary": "The concept \"the two sides of industry,\" redirected to \"social partners,\" encapsulates the tripartite relationship between employers and trade unions within the EU's labour law framework. This synergy is crucial for fostering dialogue and coherence in addressing macroeconomic reforms. Social partners, represented by confederations like ETUC and UNICE, attend summits such as those in Laeken and Barcelona, where they debate strategic topics. Their legitimacy is vital for formalising agreements that integrate diverse interests. Over the past decade, the representativeness of these partners has been stressed, ensuring that their voices contribute to the EU's innovation goals and enhance the representativity of labour relations across member states.",
