  "summary": "The concept of \"audiovisual equipment\" encompasses a wide range of devices used in communications, particularly within the EU regulatory framework. This includes theatrical projectors and microphones, essential for enhancing sound quality and visual clarity in various settings, from cinemas to sporting events. The digitalisation of audiovisual technologies has led to advancements in interleaved signals and intermodulation techniques, improving user experiences. Regulatory authorities oversee the use of these products, ensuring compliance with standards for decibels and performance. Equipment like viewfinders, adapters, and biomechanical analyzers are crucial for professional applications, while emerging technologies continue to blur the lines between traditional and modern audiovisual arrangements.",
