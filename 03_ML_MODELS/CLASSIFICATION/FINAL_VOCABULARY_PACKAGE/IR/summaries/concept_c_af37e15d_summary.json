  "summary": "The concept of \"humanitarian situation,\" as categorized under EU cooperation policy, is redirected to the preferred term \"humanitarian crisis.\" This term encapsulates the urgent circumstances arising from conflicts, natural disasters, or systemic failures that necessitate immediate humanitarian assistance. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, addressing a humanitarian crisis involves coordinated efforts among member states and institutions to provide relief, uphold human rights, and ensure compliance with international humanitarian law. The EU's response mechanisms are designed to facilitate effective cooperation and resource allocation, thereby mitigating the impacts of such crises on affected populations.",
