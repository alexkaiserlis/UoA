  "summary": "Accidental pollution refers to unintentional environmental contamination resulting from unforeseen events, such as industrial accidents or spills. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is critical for understanding liability and remediation obligations under various directives, including the Environmental Liability Directive (2004/35/EC). Accidental pollution can lead to significant deterioration of the environment, necessitating urgent responses to mitigate adverse effects on ecosystems and public health. The EU emphasizes preventive measures and strict liability to ensure that polluters bear the costs of damage, thereby fostering accountability and promoting sustainable practices across member states.",
