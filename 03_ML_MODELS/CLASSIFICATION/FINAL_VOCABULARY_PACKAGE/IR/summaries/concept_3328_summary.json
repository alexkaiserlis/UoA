  "summary": "The concept of \"per capita distribution\" within the context of EU national accounts refers to the allocation of economic resources or financial benefits on a per person basis. This metric is crucial for assessing the equitable distribution of wealth and resources among member states, facilitating comparisons of economic performance and living standards. In regulatory frameworks, per capita distribution informs policy decisions related to cohesion funds and regional development initiatives, ensuring that financial support is effectively targeted to enhance economic parity. The concept underscores the EU's commitment to promoting social and economic cohesion across its diverse member states.",
