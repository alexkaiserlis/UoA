  "summary": "Homeopathy, classified under the broader category of alternative medicine, encompasses a range of therapeutic preparations formulated from various substances, including foeniculum and hamamelis virginiana. In the EU regulatory framework, homeopathic medicines are subject to specific guidelines that ensure their efficacy and safety for patients. These preparations, often derived from herbal sources, must adhere to a pharmacopoeia that outlines dosage and administration standards. Clinical trials are essential for validating their therapeutic claims, while precautions are necessary to avoid potential distortion of effects. The widening acceptance of homeopathy reflects a choice for patients seeking alternatives to conventional medicine, though challenges remain in balancing traditional practices with scientific scrutiny.",
