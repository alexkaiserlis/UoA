  "summary": "The British Antarctic Territory (BAT) is classified under the category of overseas countries and territories, which are regions that maintain a unique relationship with the European Union. Although the BAT is not an EU member, it is subject to specific legal frameworks and regulations that govern its status and interactions with EU policies, particularly in areas such as environmental protection and scientific research. The EU's approach to the BAT reflects its commitment to international cooperation in polar regions, ensuring adherence to treaties like the Antarctic Treaty System. Consequently, the BAT remains a focal point for discussions on territorial governance and international law within the EU context.",
