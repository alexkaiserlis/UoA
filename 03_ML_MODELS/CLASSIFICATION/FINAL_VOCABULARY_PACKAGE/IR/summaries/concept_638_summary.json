  "summary": "The concept of \"farm economics,\" redirected to \"agricultural economics,\" encompasses the study of economic principles applied to agricultural operations within the EU framework. It involves the typology of holdings, defining income structures, and analyzing trends in agricultural business practices. Experts utilize surveys and data collection methods to calculate coefficients that reflect economic performance. The organization of meetings facilitates consultation among stakeholders, ensuring that economic policies are informed by empirical evidence. This concept has been referenced in various EU regulations since the EEC period, with amendments made in January and June to adapt to evolving agricultural trends and operational settings.",
