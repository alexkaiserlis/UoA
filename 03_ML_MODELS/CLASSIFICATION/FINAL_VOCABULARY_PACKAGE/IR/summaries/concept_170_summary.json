  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, a \"taxpayer\" refers to an individual or entity that is subject to taxation, which can include various forms such as income, value-added, or property taxes. Taxpayers are interposed within a complex system that governs fiscal responsibilities and compliance. They may engage in practices to optimize their tax liabilities, such as deducting expenses or opting for exemptions. However, aggressive tax avoidance strategies can lead to scrutiny and potential evasion charges. The EU framework aims to facilitate fair taxation, combat fraudulent activities like carousel schemes, and ensure that taxpayers contribute equitably to the treasury, while also addressing burdensome compliance requirements.",
