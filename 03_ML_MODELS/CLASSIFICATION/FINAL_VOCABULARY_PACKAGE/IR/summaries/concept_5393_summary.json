  "summary": "The \"ITO Charter,\" a redirect to the \"Havana Charter,\" pertains to the international trade framework established in 1948, which sought to create a multilateral trade organization. Although the ITO was never ratified, the Havana Charter laid the groundwork for future trade agreements and institutions, influencing EU trade policy. The Charter aimed to promote equitable trade practices and address issues such as tariffs and trade barriers. Its principles continue to resonate in contemporary EU regulations, emphasizing the importance of fair competition and cooperation among member states and global trading partners, thereby shaping the EU's legal landscape in international trade.",
