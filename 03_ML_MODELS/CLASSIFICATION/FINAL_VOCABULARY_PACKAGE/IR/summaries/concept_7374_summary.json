  "summary": "The concept of \"cultural movement\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework refers to organized efforts aimed at promoting cultural expression, heritage, and diversity across member states. These movements often seek to foster intercultural dialogue and enhance social cohesion, aligning with EU objectives to preserve cultural identity and support artistic innovation. Legal instruments, such as the Creative Europe programme, facilitate funding and collaboration among cultural entities, thereby reinforcing the significance of cultural movements in achieving broader EU goals related to culture and religion. Such initiatives are vital for the promotion of shared values and the enhancement of cultural pluralism within the Union.",
