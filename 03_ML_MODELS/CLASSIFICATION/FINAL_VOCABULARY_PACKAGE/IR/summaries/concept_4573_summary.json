  "summary": "Barter, within the context of EU trade regulations, refers to the exchange of goods or services directly for other goods or services without the use of currency. This practice, while less common in modern economies, remains relevant in specific sectors and among certain trading partners, particularly in scenarios where currency exchange is impractical or undesirable. The EU legal framework recognizes barter transactions, ensuring compliance with trade regulations, tax obligations, and consumer protection laws. Such exchanges must adhere to the principles of transparency and fairness, safeguarding the interests of all parties involved and promoting equitable trade practices across member states.",
