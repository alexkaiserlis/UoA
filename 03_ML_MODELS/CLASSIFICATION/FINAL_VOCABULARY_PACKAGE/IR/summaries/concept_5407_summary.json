  "summary": "The concept of \"provisional implementation of an EC agreement,\" commonly referred to as \"interim agreement (EU),\" pertains to the temporary application of agreements before their formal ratification. This mechanism allows for immediate engagement in critical areas, such as oceanographic research or fisheries management, where urgent action is needed to address issues like dolphin mortalities or straddling fish stocks. Such agreements may involve various stakeholders, including the European Union and third countries like Gabonese or Kyrgyz representatives. The provisional nature facilitates ongoing negotiations, enabling parties to revisit terms and engage in subcommittee sessions, while ensuring compliance with EU regulations and frameworks, such as the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).",
