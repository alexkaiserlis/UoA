  "summary": "Digital distribution refers to the method of delivering products and services through electronic means, particularly in the context of the European Union's regulatory framework. This concept encompasses various forms of online marketing, including e-commerce platforms and digital content distribution. The EU has established legal guidelines to ensure consumer protection, intellectual property rights, and fair competition in digital markets. Regulations such as the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act aim to create a balanced environment for digital distribution, addressing issues like market dominance and consumer rights. As digital distribution evolves, compliance with these regulations remains crucial for businesses operating within the EU.",
