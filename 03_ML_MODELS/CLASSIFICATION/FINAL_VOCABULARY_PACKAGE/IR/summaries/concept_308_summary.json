  "summary": "The term \"power crisis,\" a redirect to \"energy crisis,\" encompasses the challenges faced by the EU in maintaining stable energy supplies amid fluctuating demand and geopolitical tensions. This crisis arises from a reliance on fossil fuels, notably petroleum and thermal generators, which obliges the EU to consider alternative energy sources, such as biofuels. Regulatory frameworks aim to improve flexibility in energy production and distribution, requiring member states to maintain adequate stocks and supplies. The crisis necessitates the construction of new energy units and the continuation of existing ones, while limiting restrictions on imports to ensure a favourable balance in energy economics.",
