  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"safety standard\" refers to a set of directives mandating the minimum safety requirements for various technologies and products. These standards ensure the manoeuvrability and guarding of equipment, such as saws and scaffolding, to prevent accidents. For instance, ultralight sports equipment like skis and snowboards must comply with safety standards to mitigate risks associated with their use. Additionally, safety standards address issues like the immobilisation of machinery and the protection against hazards such as burrs and bursts. Compliance with these standards is crucial for manufacturers, ensuring that products are safe for consumers and reducing liability in cases of unattended use.",
