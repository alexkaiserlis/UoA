  "summary": "Agricultural advisory services, as defined within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, play a crucial role in improving the effectiveness of agricultural practices. These services provide support to horticulturalists and farmers, enhancing their proficiency through training programs and retraining initiatives. Skilled counsellors, often affiliated with colleges in regions like Saarland and Hessen, offer guidance on various agricultural matters, including the management of annuities and leases. Circulars and decrees from EU institutions emphasize the importance of these services in advancing agricultural productivity. By attending workshops and earning diplomas, trainees acquire essential skills that markedly affect their agricultural operations, fostering sustainable development across member states.",
