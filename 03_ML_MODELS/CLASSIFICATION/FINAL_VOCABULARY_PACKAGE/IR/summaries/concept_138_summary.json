  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"consumer\" refers to individuals or entities that purchase goods or services for personal use, rather than for profit. The effectiveness of consumer protection laws is organized through various institutions that consult and represent consumer interests. These regulations are designed to meet the needs of consumers, ensuring they are adequately informed and protected against unfair practices. The creation of consultative bodies enables a structured approach to address problems and trends affecting consumers. Membership in these organizations allows for a collective voice, ensuring that consumer rights are accorded due consideration in legislative processes, thereby enhancing overall consumer experience and satisfaction.",
