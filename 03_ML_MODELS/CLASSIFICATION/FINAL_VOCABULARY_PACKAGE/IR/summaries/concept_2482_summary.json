  "summary": "\"Solar architecture\" refers to the design and construction of buildings that effectively utilise solar energy, aligning with the EU's commitment to sustainable development and soft energy solutions. This concept is crucial in addressing globalisation challenges and mobilising resources to support the transition to renewable energy. The EU has established budgetary frameworks, such as the EGF, to assist workers affected by redundancies in traditional energy sectors, facilitating their reintegration into the labour market. By complying with structural adjustment patterns, member states can maximise contributions to solar architecture initiatives, ensuring sound investment in sustainable energy practices. This approach not only addresses energy crises but also supports the continuation of economic activity across the EU.",
