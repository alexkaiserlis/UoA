  "summary": "The concept of \"web development\" encompasses the processes involved in creating and maintaining websites, which is crucial within the EU's regulatory framework for digital communications. As the EU promotes a digital single market, web development must adhere to various legal standards, including data protection regulations under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and accessibility requirements outlined in the Web Accessibility Directive. These regulations ensure that web content is not only functional but also inclusive, fostering equitable access to information. Consequently, web development plays a pivotal role in enhancing communication channels while complying with EU legal obligations and promoting digital innovation.",
