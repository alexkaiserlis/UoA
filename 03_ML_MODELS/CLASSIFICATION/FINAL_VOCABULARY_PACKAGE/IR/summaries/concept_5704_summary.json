  "summary": "The concept of \"living language\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory documents refers to the dynamic and evolving nature of language as it adapts to societal changes, legal developments, and cultural shifts. In the EU, this concept underscores the importance of ensuring that legal texts remain accessible and relevant to diverse populations, reflecting contemporary usage and understanding. The living language principle supports the idea that legal terminology must be regularly reviewed and updated to maintain clarity and effectiveness in communication, thereby enhancing legal certainty and fostering inclusivity across member states. This adaptability is crucial for effective governance and compliance within the EU framework.",
