  "summary": "The concept of \"public opinion\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to the collective views and sentiments of citizens regarding political and social issues. It plays a crucial role in shaping policy decisions and legislative processes, as EU institutions often seek to gauge public sentiment to ensure democratic legitimacy. Public opinion can influence the formulation of regulations, the prioritization of political agendas, and the responsiveness of governance structures. Engaging with public opinion is essential for fostering transparency and accountability, thereby enhancing the participatory nature of the EU's democratic processes.",
