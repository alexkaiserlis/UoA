  "summary": "The \"European judicial area\" represents a strategic framework within the EU aimed at enhancing cooperation among member states in judicial matters. This area is designed to embed functionalities that facilitate the interconnection of judicial systems, allowing for the seamless access and enforcement of judgments across borders. Leveraging databases and registers, it targets the protection of privacy and the rights of children, particularly in matrimonial and parental contexts. The area is governed by various treaties, including the Hague and Rome conventions, which member states are encouraged to ratify. By publicly observing and assessing judicial responsibilities, the EU aims to design a sovereign space where legal processes are interconnected and effective, thereby enhancing the overall functionality of the judicial landscape.",
