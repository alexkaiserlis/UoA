  "summary": "The \"common market\" is a foundational concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, aimed at forming a unified economic space. It encourages productive investments across sectors, including agriculture and infrastructure, thereby enhancing the competitiveness of regions like Sicily and the Mezzogiorno. This market facilitates the free movement of goods, services, and capital, distinguishing it from incompatible national regulations. Indeed, it allows for the marketing of processed cereals and other products, ensuring that aids and loans are directed towards urgent projects. The common market is regarded as essential for fostering profitable economic growth and aligning diverse regional interests across the entire EU.",
