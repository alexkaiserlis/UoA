  "summary": "The concept of \"legislative power\" within the EU political framework refers to the authority vested in institutions to enact, amend, and repeal laws. This power is primarily exercised by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, which collaborate in the legislative process to ensure democratic representation and compliance with EU treaties. Legislative power encompasses various procedures, including ordinary legislative procedure and special legislative procedures, which dictate how laws are formulated and adopted. This framework is essential for maintaining the rule of law and facilitating the integration of member states within the EU's legal system, thereby promoting cohesion and governance across the Union.",
