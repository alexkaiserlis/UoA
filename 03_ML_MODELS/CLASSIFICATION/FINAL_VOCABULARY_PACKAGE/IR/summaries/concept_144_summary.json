  "summary": "The \"adoption of the budget\" is a critical process within the European Union's financial framework, governed by legal and regulatory provisions. This procedure involves the formulation, negotiation, and approval of the EU's annual budget, which outlines the allocation of resources for various policies and programs. The budgetary process is primarily regulated by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the Financial Regulation, ensuring transparency and accountability. The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union play pivotal roles in the adoption process, reflecting democratic principles and fiscal responsibility. This concept underscores the EU's commitment to sound financial management and strategic planning.",
