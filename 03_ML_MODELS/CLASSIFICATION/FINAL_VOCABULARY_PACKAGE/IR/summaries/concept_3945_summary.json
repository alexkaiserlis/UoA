  "summary": "The concept of \"taking of hostages,\" categorized under criminal law, is synonymous with \"illegal restraint.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this term encompasses actions where individuals are unlawfully detained to compel a third party to act or refrain from acting. The EU prioritizes the prevention and prosecution of such acts, aligning with international human rights standards. Member States are encouraged to harmonize their legal definitions and penalties related to illegal restraint, ensuring robust protection against this serious offense. The redirect from \"taking of hostages\" to \"illegal restraint\" reflects a focus on the broader implications of unlawful detention in EU law.",
