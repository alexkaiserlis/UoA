  "summary": "A \"miscarriage of justice\" refers to a failure in the legal system that results in the wrongful conviction or punishment of an innocent individual. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such miscarriages undermine the principles of justice and fairness enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The EU emphasizes the importance of effective legal remedies and the right to a fair trial, aiming to prevent and rectify such injustices. Mechanisms like the European Court of Human Rights serve to address grievances arising from miscarriages of justice, ensuring accountability and the protection of individual rights within member states.",
