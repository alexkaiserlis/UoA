  "summary": "The concept of \"transfer revenues,\" categorized under national accounts, is redirected to the preferred term \"social transfers.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, social transfers refer to the redistribution of resources by governments to support individuals and households, particularly in times of need. These transfers can include pensions, unemployment benefits, and other forms of social assistance, which are crucial for maintaining social cohesion and economic stability within Member States. Understanding social transfers is essential for analyzing national accounts, as they reflect the fiscal policies and welfare systems that underpin the EU's commitment to social protection and economic solidarity.",
