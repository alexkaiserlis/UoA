  "summary": "\"Concerted economic action\" refers to coordinated efforts by businesses or entities to achieve economic objectives, often in the context of EU competition law. Such actions may involve collaboration that could potentially restrict competition, leading to scrutiny under Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The EU regulatory framework aims to prevent anti-competitive practices while allowing for certain cooperative arrangements that enhance efficiency or innovation. Understanding concerted economic action is crucial for compliance with EU regulations, as it delineates permissible collaboration from illicit collusion that undermines market integrity and consumer welfare.",
