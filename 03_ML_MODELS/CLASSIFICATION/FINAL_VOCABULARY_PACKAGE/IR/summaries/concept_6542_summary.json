  "summary": "The concept of \"independence of the elderly\" is closely related to the preferred term \"dependence of elderly persons,\" reflecting the EU's focus on social affairs concerning aging populations. In legal and regulatory contexts, this concept addresses the need for frameworks that promote the autonomy and well-being of elderly individuals, ensuring they can live independently while receiving necessary support. EU policies aim to mitigate the risks of dependence through initiatives that enhance social inclusion, access to healthcare, and community services. By redirecting to the preferred term, the emphasis shifts to understanding the challenges faced by elderly persons in achieving independence, thus informing relevant legislative measures.",
