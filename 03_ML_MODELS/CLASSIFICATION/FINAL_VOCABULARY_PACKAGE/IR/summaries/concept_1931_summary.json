  "summary": "Militarism, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the prioritization of military power and defense capabilities in national and international policy-making. This concept raises significant implications for politics and public safety, as it can influence the allocation of resources, the formulation of defense strategies, and the establishment of security alliances. The EU's approach to militarism is often scrutinized in relation to its commitment to peace, human rights, and democratic governance. As such, discussions surrounding militarism are integral to understanding the balance between national security interests and the promotion of stability within the EU and its member states.",
