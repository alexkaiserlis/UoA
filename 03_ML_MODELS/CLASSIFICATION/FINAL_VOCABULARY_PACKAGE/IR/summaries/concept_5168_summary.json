  "summary": "The term \"Mafia\" in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to organized crime groups that engage in illicit activities, undermining social order and economic stability. The European Union has implemented various legal instruments aimed at combating such criminal organizations, emphasizing cooperation among member states through frameworks like the European Arrest Warrant and mutual legal assistance. These measures are designed to enhance the efficacy of law enforcement and judicial systems in addressing transnational crime. The EU recognizes the detrimental impact of Mafia-related activities on society, prompting ongoing efforts to strengthen legal responses and promote social cohesion across its jurisdictions.",
