  "summary": "The concept of \"international loan\" pertains to monetary relations within the EU framework, where financial institutions provide funds across national borders. Such loans are governed by a complex interplay of legal regulations and treaties that ensure compliance with both EU law and international financial standards. In the context of EU legal documents, international loans facilitate cross-border investments and economic cooperation among member states. They are subject to scrutiny under EU competition law to prevent market distortions. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape surrounding international loans is designed to promote transparency and protect the rights of borrowers, thereby fostering a stable financial environment.",
