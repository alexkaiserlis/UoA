  "summary": "The \"promulgation of a law\" refers to the formal process by which a legislative act is officially announced and made accessible to the public, thereby establishing its legal validity within the European Union. This procedure typically follows the adoption of a law by the Parliament and the Council, marking the transition from legislative deliberation to enforceable regulation. The promulgation is crucial for ensuring transparency and legal certainty, as it informs citizens and stakeholders of their rights and obligations under the new law. In the EU context, this process underscores the importance of democratic principles and adherence to the rule of law in parliamentary proceedings.",
