Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, it is a critical concern addressed by various directives and regulations aimed at mitigating environmental deterioration. The EU has established comprehensive policies, such as the European Climate Law, which sets binding targets for reducing emissions and enhancing climate resilience. These legal instruments are designed to combat the adverse effects of anthropogenic climate change, promoting sustainable development and environmental protection across member states, thereby ensuring compliance with international climate agreements.",
