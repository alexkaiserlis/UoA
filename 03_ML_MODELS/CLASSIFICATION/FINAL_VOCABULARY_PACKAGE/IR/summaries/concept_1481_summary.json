  "summary": "The concept of \"question put to a minister\" refers to a formal inquiry directed at a government minister within the framework of parliamentary proceedings in the European Union. This mechanism allows Members of Parliament (MEPs) to seek clarification, accountability, or information regarding governmental actions and policies. Such questions are pivotal in fostering transparency and ensuring that ministers are held accountable for their decisions. The process is governed by specific parliamentary rules, which dictate how questions are submitted, addressed, and recorded. This practice underscores the essential role of parliamentary oversight in the EU's democratic governance structure.",
