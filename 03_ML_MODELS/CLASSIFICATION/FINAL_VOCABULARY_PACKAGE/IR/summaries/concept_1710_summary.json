  "summary": "The concept of \"class struggle\" pertains to the socio-economic tensions between different social classes, particularly in the context of labor relations and social justice. Within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, class struggle can influence policies aimed at promoting social cohesion, equitable labor rights, and combating inequality. The EU's commitment to social affairs often reflects an awareness of class dynamics, advocating for mechanisms that address disparities and protect vulnerable groups. This concept underscores the importance of balancing economic interests with social welfare, ensuring that legislative measures foster an inclusive society where class-related conflicts are mitigated through dialogue and policy intervention.",
