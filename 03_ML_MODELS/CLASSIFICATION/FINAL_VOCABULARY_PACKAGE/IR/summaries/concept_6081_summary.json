  "summary": "The \"social clause\" in the context of EU international trade refers to provisions that integrate social standards and labor rights into trade agreements. This concept aims to ensure that trade liberalization does not undermine social protections and labor conditions. By embedding social clauses, the EU seeks to promote sustainable development and uphold fundamental rights, thereby fostering equitable trade practices. These clauses may include commitments to adhere to international labor standards and protect workers' rights. The inclusion of social clauses reflects the EU's broader regulatory framework that prioritizes social justice alongside economic interests in its trade policies.",
