  "summary": "A \"town-planning scheme\" refers to a regulatory framework established within the European Union to guide the development and organization of urban areas. These schemes are essential for ensuring sustainable construction practices and effective land use, aligning with EU directives on environmental protection and spatial planning. They typically encompass zoning regulations, infrastructure development, and community engagement processes. By providing a structured approach to urban development, town-planning schemes facilitate compliance with EU standards, promote social cohesion, and enhance the quality of life for residents. Such schemes are integral to achieving the EU's broader objectives of sustainable urbanization and regional development.",
