  "summary": "The term \"auxiliary worker\" refers to individuals who provide supplementary labor in various sectors, often characterized by temporary or part-time employment arrangements. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, auxiliary workers play a crucial role in addressing labor market fluctuations and fulfilling short-term demands. Although not classified as primary employees, their contributions are essential for operational flexibility within businesses. The EU has established guidelines to ensure that the rights and working conditions of auxiliary workers are safeguarded, promoting fair treatment and compliance with labor standards across member states. This concept underscores the importance of adaptable workforce strategies in the evolving labor market.",
