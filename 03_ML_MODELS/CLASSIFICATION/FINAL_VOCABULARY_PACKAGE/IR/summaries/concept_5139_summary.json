  "summary": "A \"labour tribunal\" is a specialized judicial body within the EU legal system, tasked with adjudicating disputes between employers and employees. These tribunals often comprise judges who are appointed through a transparent process, ensuring that candidates are chosen based on merit. The appointment of judges may involve discussions among national representatives, including those from Estonian, Maltese, and Hungarian backgrounds, reflecting the diverse legal traditions within the EU. Labour tribunals play a critical role in upholding workers' rights, addressing issues such as wrongful dismissal and workplace discrimination. Their decisions set precedents that influence broader employment law, ensuring fair treatment and publicity for all parties involved.",
