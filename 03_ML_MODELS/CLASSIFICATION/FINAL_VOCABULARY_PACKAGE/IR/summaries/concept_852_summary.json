  "summary": "The term \"ECSC aid\" refers to financial assistance provided under the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) framework, which was established to regulate the coal and steel industries in Europe. This aid is designed to support economic policy initiatives aimed at fostering competitiveness and addressing market imbalances within these sectors. Although the ECSC was dissolved in 2002, the legacy of its aid mechanisms continues to influence EU regulatory practices, particularly in the context of state aid control. The principles established during the ECSC era remain relevant for contemporary economic policy, ensuring that support measures align with EU competition law and promote sustainable development.",
