  "summary": "Waste statistics refer to the systematic collection, analysis, and dissemination of data regarding the generation, management, and disposal of waste within the European Union. This concept is crucial for assessing the deterioration of the environment, as it provides insights into waste trends, recycling rates, and compliance with EU regulations. The EU's legal framework mandates member states to report waste statistics to ensure effective environmental governance and to inform policy-making aimed at reducing waste and promoting sustainability. Accurate waste statistics are essential for evaluating the effectiveness of waste management strategies and for fostering a circular economy within the EU.",
