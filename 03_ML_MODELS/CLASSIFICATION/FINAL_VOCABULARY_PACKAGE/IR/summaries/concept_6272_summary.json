  "summary": "Quantitative analysis in the context of EU legal and regulatory documents refers to the systematic examination of data to define the composition and characteristics of various materials, such as bicomponent fibres, polyamide, and polypropylene. This analysis is crucial for ensuring compliance with directives that require accurate labelling and marking of textile mixtures. By employing uniform methods, recent findings can indicate the content and adaptation of products, thereby protecting consumer interests. The analysis lays the groundwork for checks and balances, ensuring that all products meet the necessary standards as outlined in annexes and repealed regulations, while also adapting to evolving market needs.",
