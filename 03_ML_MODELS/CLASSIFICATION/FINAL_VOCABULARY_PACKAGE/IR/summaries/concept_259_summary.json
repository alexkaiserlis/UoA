  "summary": "The concept of \"migratory movement\" encompasses the various phenomena associated with the movement of individuals, particularly foreigners, across borders within the EU framework. It is integral to the EU's migration policy, which aims to build solidarity among member states while addressing disparities in asylum and refugee experiences. The legal instruments, such as the Schengen Agreement and the Dublin Regulation, facilitate the management of these movements, ensuring that individuals, including those persecuted or trafficked, are treated humanely. The EU's acquis and commitments under international pacts, like the Geneva Convention, are crucial in shaping the curriculum for integrating refugees and assisting their stay in host countries. The European Migration Network (EMN) observes these movements, providing data that informs policy proposals and reinforces the EU's humanitarian tradition.",
