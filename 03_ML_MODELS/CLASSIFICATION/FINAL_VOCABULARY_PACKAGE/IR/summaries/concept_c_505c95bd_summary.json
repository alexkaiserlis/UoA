  "summary": "The concept of \"social resilience,\" redirected to \"community resilience,\" pertains to the capacity of communities within the EU to withstand and recover from socio-economic challenges and crises. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, community resilience is essential for effective management of resources, fostering social cohesion, and ensuring sustainable development. Regulatory measures often emphasize enhancing community resilience through policies that promote social inclusion, participatory governance, and adaptive strategies. By prioritizing community resilience, the EU aims to build robust societies capable of navigating complex challenges, thereby reinforcing the overall stability and integrity of the Union.",
