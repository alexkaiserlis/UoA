  "summary": "The concept of \"neo-Fascism,\" categorized under the political framework of the EU, is a redirect to the preferred term \"Fascism.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, Fascism is characterized by authoritarian ultranationalism, often accompanied by dictatorial power and suppression of dissent. The EU's commitment to democracy and human rights necessitates vigilance against any resurgence of such ideologies, including neo-Fascism. Regulatory frameworks aim to counteract hate speech and discrimination, ensuring that the values of pluralism and tolerance are upheld. Thus, understanding the implications of Fascism is crucial for maintaining the integrity of EU governance and societal cohesion.",
