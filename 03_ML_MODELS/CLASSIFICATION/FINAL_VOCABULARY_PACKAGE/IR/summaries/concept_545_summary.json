  "summary": "The concept of \"access to a profession\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the ordination of occupational standards and the safeguarding of professional qualifications across member states. Divergencies in national legislations can distort the homogeneity of professional admission processes, affecting operators in various sectors, such as haulage and insurance. The EU aims to ensure that professionals can pursue their occupations without undue barriers, thereby enhancing revenue and consumer assurance. This pursuit is facilitated by supervisory bodies that engage in the automatic recognition of qualifications, ensuring that professionals are situated on a footing of equality, regardless of their country of origin.",
