  "summary": "The term \"administrators' function group\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"administrator\" within the context of EU institutions and the European civil service. Administrators are empowered to execute various functions that are crucial for the effective operation of EU institutions. Their roles are bound by treaties and regulations, which determine their status and obligations. This function group is tasked with translating legal texts into multiple languages, thereby ensuring that judgments and acts are accessible to all member states, including Ireland. Amendments to their functions may occur at yearly intervals, reflecting the evolving needs of governance and justice within the EU framework.",
