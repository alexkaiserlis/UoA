The regulation of overtime is crucial for ensuring fair working conditions and preventing exploitation. EU directives, such as the Working Time Directive, establish minimum standards for working hours, including provisions for overtime compensation. Employers are required to monitor and report overtime accurately, ensuring compliance with labor regulations that aim to protect workers' rights and promote a balanced organization of work. Proper management of overtime is essential for maintaining workplace equity and employee well-being.",
