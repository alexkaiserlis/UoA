  "summary": "The concept of \"transgender\" is redirected to the preferred term \"gender identity\" within the framework of EU legal and regulatory documents. Gender identity encompasses the personal sense of one's own gender, which may differ from the sex assigned at birth. The EU recognizes the importance of protecting rights and freedoms related to gender identity, ensuring non-discrimination and promoting equality. This recognition is crucial in various legal contexts, including anti-discrimination directives and human rights frameworks. By addressing issues of gender identity, the EU aims to foster an inclusive environment that respects individual autonomy and dignity, thereby enhancing social cohesion across member states.",
