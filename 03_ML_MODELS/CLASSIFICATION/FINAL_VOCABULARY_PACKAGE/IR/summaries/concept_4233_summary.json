  "summary": "\"Worker self-management,\" often redirected to the preferred term \"self-management,\" refers to a governance model where employees have significant control over their work processes and decision-making within an organization. In the context of EU labour law and labour relations, this concept promotes democratic participation and enhances worker autonomy, aligning with principles of social dialogue and collective bargaining. Self-management can empower workers, fostering a collaborative environment that may lead to improved productivity and job satisfaction. The EU regulatory framework encourages such practices, recognizing their potential to contribute to a more equitable and participatory labour market.",
