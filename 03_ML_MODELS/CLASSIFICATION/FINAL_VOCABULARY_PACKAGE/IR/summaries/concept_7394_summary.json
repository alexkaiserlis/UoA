  "summary": "The concept of \"sociology of politics,\" redirected to \"political sociology,\" pertains to the study of the interplay between society and political structures within the EU context. Political sociology examines how social dynamics, including class, ethnicity, and culture, influence political behavior and institutions. This field is crucial for understanding the regulatory frameworks that govern EU member states, as it provides insights into public opinion, civic engagement, and the legitimacy of political authority. By analyzing these relationships, policymakers can better address societal needs and enhance democratic governance, ensuring that EU regulations reflect the diverse interests of its citizens.",
