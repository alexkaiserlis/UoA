  "summary": "The concept of \"slavery\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to severe violations of human rights, routinely condemned by international bodies such as the ILO and the Geneva conventions. It encompasses various forms of coercion, including trafficking and forced labor, which often emerge from violent relationships and generalized abuses. Victims, frequently from civilian populations, face allegations of exploitation that challenge their fundamental rights. The EU actively seeks to lift these violations through collaborative efforts with unions like the ETUC and ICFTU, aiming to corroborate claims and support complainants. The spirit of the EU constitution emphasizes attaining freedom from such abuses, reinforcing the need for robust responses to these widespread issues.",
