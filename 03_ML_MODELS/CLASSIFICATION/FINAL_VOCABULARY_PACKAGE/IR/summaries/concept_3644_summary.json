  "summary": "A \"ministerial meeting\" refers to a formal gathering of government ministers from EU member states, typically convened to discuss and coordinate international affairs. These meetings serve as a platform for dialogue on critical issues such as trade, security, and environmental policy, facilitating consensus-building and collaborative decision-making. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, ministerial meetings play a pivotal role in shaping policies that align with the Union's strategic objectives. They often result in joint declarations or agreements that influence legislative initiatives and enhance cooperation among member states, thereby reinforcing the EU's collective governance structure.",
