  "summary": "\"National expenditure\" refers to the financial outlays incurred by a government within the framework of national accounts, crucial for assessing eligibility for EU funding and investments. These expenditures are programmed to stabilize economic zones and are chargeable against national budgets. Discussions surrounding national expenditure often involve bilateral agreements and findings from conciliation processes, which may include judgments regarding refunds for insufficiently performed projects. The continuity of financing is essential, and deadlines must be adhered to, as failure to meet these can jeopardise eligibility. Written summaries of incurred costs are forwarded to the EU for clearance and further evaluation, ensuring compliance with stipulated regulations.",
