  "summary": "The concept of \"plasticulture,\" redirected to \"cultivation under plastic,\" pertains to the innovative agricultural practice of utilizing plastic materials to enhance crop production. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this method is significant for its potential to improve yield efficiency and resource management in the cultivation of agricultural land. The European Union recognizes the importance of sustainable agricultural practices, and cultivation under plastic is often subject to regulations concerning environmental impact, waste management, and the use of biodegradable materials. This approach aligns with EU objectives to promote sustainable farming while addressing challenges such as climate change and food security.",
