  "summary": "The concept of \"translator,\" as redirected to the preferred term \"information profession,\" encompasses the essential role of linguists, interpreters, and translators within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. These professionals are crucial for drafting and translating documents, ensuring that judgments and official communications are accessible in multiple languages, including Maltese and English. The recruitment of qualified staff is vital to prevent backlog and remedy issues arising from a lack of resources. As EU institutions engage in multilingual conferences, the need for improved translation services remains paramount. This auxiliary support prevails in facilitating effective contacts among officials, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the legislative process.",
