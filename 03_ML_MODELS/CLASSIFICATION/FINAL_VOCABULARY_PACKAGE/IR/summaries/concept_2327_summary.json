  "summary": "A \"building permit\" is a legal authorization required prior to the commencement of construction activities, ensuring compliance with local zoning laws, safety standards, and environmental regulations. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, building permits play a crucial role in urban planning and sustainable development. They facilitate the orderly development of infrastructure while safeguarding public interests. The issuance of a building permit typically involves a thorough review process, including assessments of potential impacts on the surrounding environment and community. This regulatory mechanism is essential for maintaining coherence in construction practices across member states, promoting adherence to EU directives on urban development.",
