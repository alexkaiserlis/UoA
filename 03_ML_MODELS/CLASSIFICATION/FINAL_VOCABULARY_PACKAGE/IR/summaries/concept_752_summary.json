  "summary": "Tidal power, also referred to as tidal energy, is classified under the category of soft energy within EU regulatory frameworks. This renewable energy source harnesses the gravitational forces exerted by the moon and sun, resulting in predictable tidal movements. The European Union promotes tidal energy as part of its commitment to sustainable development and the transition to a low-carbon economy. Legal instruments, such as the Renewable Energy Directive, encourage member states to invest in and implement tidal power projects, thereby enhancing energy security and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The redirect from \"tidal power\" to \"tidal energy\" underscores the preferred terminology in EU discourse.",
