  "summary": "Extraterritorial jurisdiction refers to the capacity of a state or legal entity to exercise legal authority beyond its territorial boundaries. In the context of EU law, this concept is pivotal as it allows the European Union to regulate activities that occur outside its borders, particularly concerning human rights, environmental protection, and competition law. The EU employs extraterritorial jurisdiction to ensure compliance with its regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies to entities processing personal data of EU citizens regardless of their location. This jurisdictional reach underscores the EU's commitment to uphold its legal standards globally.",
