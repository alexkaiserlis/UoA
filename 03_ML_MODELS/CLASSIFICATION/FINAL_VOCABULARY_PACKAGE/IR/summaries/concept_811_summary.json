  "summary": "Technical barriers to trade (TBT) refer to regulatory obstructions that can hinder international commerce within the EU. These barriers often manifest through stringent technicality in product standards, approvals, and measurements, which can include requirements for translations of documents and signatures. For instance, a manufacturer of gossypium-based products may face challenges due to differing regulations on hazardous substances, such as gaseous emissions. The EU aims to harmonize these regulations to facilitate smoother trade, thereby reducing the need for computerized catalogues and ensuring that all constituents adhere to a unified framework. Such harmonization is indispensable for promoting automation and enhancing the vision of a cohesive internal market.",
