  "summary": "The \"Council for Mutual Economic Assistance,\" commonly referred to as \"Comecon,\" was an economic organization established in 1949 to foster economic cooperation among socialist states, primarily in Eastern Europe. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, Comecon's legacy influences discussions on economic integration and cooperation among member states. Although it is now defunct, the principles of mutual assistance and economic collaboration it promoted continue to resonate within EU policies aimed at enhancing economic cohesion and solidarity among diverse economies. This redirect emphasizes the historical significance of Comecon in shaping contemporary economic relations in Europe.",
