  "summary": "Skimmed milk powder, categorized under processed agricultural produce (6016), is a vital product within EU regulations. It is often repackaged and vitaminized to enhance its quality, ensuring compliance with stipulated standards. The incorporation of skimmed milk powder into various mixes and products is regularly monitored by governing bodies to maintain safety, particularly concerning coliforms. The intervention mechanisms allow for the remarketing of surplus quantities, which can be delivered to charities or used in food programs (WFP). Recent tendencies in the market indicate an increment in demand, prompting committees to regularize selling practices and deepen oversight on packaging and reconstitution methods.",
