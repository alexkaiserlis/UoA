  "summary": "The \"Kingdom of Bhutan,\" categorized under economic geography (7231), serves as a redirect to the preferred term \"Bhutan.\" This designation is significant in EU legal and regulatory contexts, particularly concerning trade agreements, environmental policies, and development cooperation initiatives. Bhutan's unique economic landscape, characterized by its commitment to Gross National Happiness and sustainable development, presents distinct regulatory challenges and opportunities for EU engagement. Understanding Bhutan's economic geography is essential for EU institutions when formulating policies that impact bilateral relations, trade negotiations, and regional cooperation in South Asia. This redirect emphasizes the importance of accurate terminology in legal documentation and analysis.",
