  "summary": "Zootechnics, a term redirected from \"zootechny,\" encompasses the scientific and regulatory aspects of livestock management within the EU's agricultural framework. This field involves the application of various additives and microorganisms, such as actisaf, norel, and biozyme, to enhance animal health and productivity. Regulatory documents address the use of substances like selenomethionine and maduramycin, ensuring compliance with safety standards. The incorporation of innovative products, including levucell and safizym, is subject to rigorous autho친risation processes. Additionally, zootechnics involves the management of litters and translocations, emphasizing the importance of biosecurity measures against pathogens, including coxidin and sorbial. The integration of these elements is crucial for sustainable agricultural practices in the EU.",
