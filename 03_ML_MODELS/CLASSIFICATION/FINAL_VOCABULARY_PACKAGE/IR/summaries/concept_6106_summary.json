  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"protected right\" is often synonymous with \"established right.\" This concept pertains to rights that have been formally recognized and safeguarded within the legal framework, ensuring their enforcement and protection against infringement. Established rights are integral to the rule of law, providing individuals and entities with a sense of security and predictability in their legal relations. The recognition of such rights is crucial for upholding fundamental freedoms and promoting justice within the EU. As a redirect, \"protected right\" leads to \"established right,\" emphasizing the importance of these rights in the broader legal landscape.",
