  "summary": "The concept of \"establishment of the Community budget,\" which redirects to the \"drawing up of the EU budget,\" pertains to the procedural framework governing the formulation and approval of the European Union's financial plan. This process is crucial for ensuring transparency and accountability in the allocation of resources across member states. The drawing up of the EU budget involves intricate negotiations among EU institutions, primarily the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council of the European Union. This regulatory mechanism not only dictates funding priorities but also reflects the EU's strategic objectives, thereby facilitating effective governance and financial management within the Union.",
