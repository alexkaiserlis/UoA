  "summary": "The \"silver economy\" refers to the economic activities and policies aimed at addressing the needs and potential of the aging population in the European Union. This concept encompasses a range of sectors, including healthcare, technology, and social services, which are increasingly relevant due to demographic shifts. The EU legal and regulatory framework supports the development of the silver economy through initiatives that promote active aging, social inclusion, and innovation. By fostering a sustainable environment for older individuals, the silver economy aims to enhance their quality of life while contributing to economic growth, thereby aligning with broader economic policy objectives within the EU.",
