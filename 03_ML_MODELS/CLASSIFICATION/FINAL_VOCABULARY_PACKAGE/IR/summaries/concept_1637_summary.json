  "summary": "The concept of \"putting into free circulation,\" often referred to as \"free circulation,\" is pivotal in EU tariff policy, facilitating the unobstructed movement of goods within the internal market. This regulatory framework ensures that products, such as stoneware and earthenware pottery, can be imported without prohibitive tariffs, thereby enhancing cooperations among member states. The process involves a notification system that allows for the rapid conveyance of goods, ensuring compliance with EU regulations. This legal mechanism is particularly relevant for products like haloumi and tulum peyniri, which may require specific judgments regarding their authenticity. By restabilizing trade dynamics, the regulation supports a vibrant community of producers and consumers, while forbidding practices that mislead stakeholders.",
