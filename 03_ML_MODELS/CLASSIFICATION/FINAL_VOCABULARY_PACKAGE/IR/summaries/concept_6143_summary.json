  "summary": "The concept of \"economic transition\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to the process of shifting from traditional economic models towards more sustainable and innovative practices. This transition is essential for addressing contemporary challenges such as climate change, digitalization, and socio-economic disparities. EU policies aim to facilitate this transformation by promoting investment in green technologies, enhancing regulatory frameworks, and fostering economic resilience. The legal instruments employed, including directives and regulations, are designed to support member states in implementing strategies that align with the overarching goals of the European Green Deal and the Digital Single Market, thereby ensuring a cohesive approach to economic evolution.",
