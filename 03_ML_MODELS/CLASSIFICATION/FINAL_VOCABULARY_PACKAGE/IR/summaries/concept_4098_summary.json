  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the concept of \"tradition\" is often redirected to \"customs and traditions,\" emphasizing the importance of cultural heritage in policy-making. Customs and traditions play a pivotal role in shaping societal norms and values within member states, influencing legislation and regulatory practices. The EU recognizes that these elements are vital for fostering cultural diversity and social cohesion. By integrating customs and traditions into legal considerations, the EU aims to respect and promote the unique identities of its member states, ensuring that cultural heritage is preserved while advancing common objectives in various sectors, including education and social policy.",
