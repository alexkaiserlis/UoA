  "summary": "Unfair advertising, also referred to as \"advertising malpractice,\" is a critical concept within EU competition law. It pertains to practices that mislead consumers or distort competition, thereby undermining the integrity of the market. The EU regulatory framework, particularly under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, seeks to prohibit such deceptive practices, ensuring that advertising is truthful and not misleading. This concept is essential for maintaining fair competition and protecting consumer rights across member states. By addressing advertising malpractice, the EU aims to foster a transparent marketplace, thereby enhancing consumer trust and promoting equitable business practices.",
