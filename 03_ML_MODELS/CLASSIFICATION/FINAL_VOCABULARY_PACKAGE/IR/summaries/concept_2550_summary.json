  "summary": "The \"working population\" concept encompasses individuals engaged in various occupations within the EU labour market, reflecting demographic diversity and adaptability. It is crucial for biennial censuses and datasets that inform policy-making, particularly regarding youth and disabled individuals. The EU emphasizes mainstreaming strategies to recruit migrants and align attitudes towards inclusivity. Administrative frameworks, such as the ILO standards, guide the regulation of salaries and working conditions. By investing in lifelong learning and expeditious training programs, the EU aims to enhance the employability of unemployed individuals. This concept serves as a pillar for understanding labour dynamics and improving outcomes across domains.",
