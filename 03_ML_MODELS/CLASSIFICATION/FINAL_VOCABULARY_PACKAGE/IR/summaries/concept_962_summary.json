  "summary": "The concept of \"type of tenure\" within the category of farming systems refers to the legal and regulatory frameworks governing land use and agricultural practices in the EU. It encompasses various arrangements, such as ownership, leasing, and sharecropping, which dictate the rights and responsibilities of farmers. Understanding different types of tenure is crucial for compliance with EU agricultural policies, including those related to land management, environmental sustainability, and rural development. These frameworks aim to ensure equitable access to land resources while promoting efficient farming practices that align with EU objectives for food security and environmental protection.",
