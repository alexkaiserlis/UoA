  "summary": "The concept of \"record library\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework refers to a systematic collection of documents and records that are essential for maintaining transparency and accountability in governance. Such libraries serve as repositories for legal texts, regulatory guidelines, and documentation pertinent to EU legislation. They facilitate access to historical and current records, thereby supporting compliance with legal obligations and enabling stakeholders to engage with the regulatory environment effectively. The establishment of a record library is crucial for ensuring that relevant information is preserved, organized, and made available for public scrutiny, thereby enhancing the integrity of the EU's legal processes.",
