  "summary": "The European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR) was established to facilitate the reconstruction and development of regions affected by conflict, particularly in the Western Balkans, including Kosovo, Albania, Montenegro, and Serbia. Its mandate emphasizes the importance of infrastructure rebuilding and economic restructuring, contributing to the reunification of the region post-Yugoslavia. The agency allocates earmarked funds to beneficiaries, encouraging projects that respect the acquis communautaire and promote stability. By planning and implementing reconstruction efforts, the EAR addresses problems of isolation and property disputes, aiming for a strong solution that precludes future conflicts and fosters regional cooperation, including in telecommunications and other sectors.",
