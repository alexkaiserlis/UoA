  "summary": "The \"tax on profits of self-employment\" pertains to the fiscal obligations imposed on individuals engaging in self-employment across the EU. This taxation governs the profits received from self-generated income, ensuring neutrality in comparison to corporate taxation. The regulatory framework aims to eliminate distortions that might disadvantage self-employed individuals relative to corporate entities. Various EU protocols and conventions, including those established in Brussels, facilitate the taxation process, allowing for the deduction of certain expenses. Moreover, the elimination of double taxation through agreements can be advantageous for self-employed individuals, particularly in cross-border scenarios. This taxation system ought to refrain from hampering productivity and supports the formation of a fair economic environment.",
