  "summary": "Roadworthiness tests are essential regulatory measures within the EU transport policy framework, aimed at ensuring the safety and operational integrity of vehicles. These tests, often conducted by certified surveyors, evaluate various aspects, including emissions, opacity, and hydrostatic performance. In circumstances where vehicles remain uninspected, the risks of polluters, such as taxis and ambulances, increase significantly. The tests embrace a comprehensive approach, spanning commercial and private vehicles, and utilize advanced technologies like transponders and OBDs. Recognitions from bodies like DNV and Lloyd's enhance the credibility of these assessments, ensuring that vehicles meet the necessary safety standards and limiters for public use.",
