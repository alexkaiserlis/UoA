  "summary": "\"Assembly line work\" refers to a systematic approach to production where tasks are divided into sequential operations, enhancing efficiency and productivity. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is critical for understanding the organisation of work and working conditions. Regulations such as the Framework Directive on Safety and Health at Work (89/391/EEC) address the implications of assembly line work on worker safety, emphasizing the need for ergonomic assessments and risk management. The EU also promotes fair working conditions, ensuring that assembly line workers are protected under labor laws, which aim to uphold their rights and welfare in industrial settings.",
