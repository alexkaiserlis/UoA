  "summary": "The concept of \"smartphone,\" categorized under communications, is redirected to the preferred term \"mobile phone\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Mobile phones, including advanced devices from manufacturers like Nokia and Siemens, utilize microprocessors and chips operating on various frequencies such as GSM, UMTS, and LTE. The regulation of these devices involves ensuring compliance with airworthiness standards and spectrum management, as outlined by CEPT. As technology shifts, the integration of consoles and computers into mobile phones has become prevalent, necessitating updated legal frameworks to address issues related to subcontractors, aggressive marketing, and implied warranties. The evolving landscape of mobile communications continues to influence regulatory approaches across the EU.",
