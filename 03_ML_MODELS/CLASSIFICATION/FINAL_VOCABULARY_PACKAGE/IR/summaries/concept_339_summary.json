  "summary": "The concept of \"felling of trees,\" categorized under the deterioration of the environment, is primarily addressed in EU legal and regulatory frameworks as \"deforestation.\" This term encompasses the systematic removal of trees, which significantly impacts biodiversity, contributes to climate change, and leads to habitat loss. The EU has implemented various directives and regulations aimed at mitigating deforestation, promoting sustainable forest management, and enhancing reforestation efforts. These measures are crucial for achieving the EU's environmental objectives, including the preservation of ecosystems and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Understanding this concept is vital for compliance with EU environmental legislation.",
