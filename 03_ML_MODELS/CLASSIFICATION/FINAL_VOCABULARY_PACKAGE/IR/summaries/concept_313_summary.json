  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"shrimp\" is redirected to the preferred term \"crustacean,\" encompassing various species such as Penaeus and Monodon. These crustaceous organisms, often subject to overexploitation, are vital in fisheries activities across regions like the Cantabrian Sea and the Kategat. The regulatory framework addresses issues such as predation impacts on shrimp populations and the sustainable management of their habitats. Notably, the shrimp's tails and claws are significant in culinary applications, including boiled and pealed preparations. The EU's commitment to sustainable fisheries aims to protect these species, ensuring compliance with veterinary standards and promoting micronutrient-rich diets.",
