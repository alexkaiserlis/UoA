  "summary": "The concept of \"military expenditure,\" redirected to \"defence expenditure,\" pertains to the financial resources allocated by EU member states for military purposes, encompassing operational, training, and maintenance needs. Within the context of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), this expenditure is crucial for maintaining security and operational readiness. The EU legal framework progressively shifts towards integrated defence structures, ensuring that member states can effectively cover joint missions. As budgets are extended, countries are liable for adhering to established rules, which aim to prevent the deterioration of security capabilities and undermine collective responsibilities. This expenditure is essential for fulfilling mandates and addressing external threats.",
