  "summary": "Tax harmonisation within the EU context refers to the stepwise approach to aligning tax policies among member states, thereby combating tax avoidance and ensuring a fairer economic landscape. This process underscores the need for consistency in taxation criteria, particularly concerning vehicles and leasehold arrangements. By addressing issues such as the cession of rights and the treatment of undervalued assets, tax harmonisation aims to alleviate the inoperability of disparate tax systems. The concept also encompasses the regulation of excise duties on products like cigars and cigarillos, which subsists under EU law. Ultimately, tax harmonisation seeks to create a cohesive framework that relieves administrative burdens on lessors and lessees alike, fostering a more integrated market.",
