  "summary": "Transport safety within the EU regulatory framework encompasses a range of measures aimed at ensuring the inviolable safety of all transport modes, including maritime, aviation, and road transport. The concept involves the establishment of standards for buoyage systems, the regulation of ultralight aircraft, and the oversight of ambulances and vans to ensure compliance with safety protocols. Legal definitions related to transport safety, such as those concerning the roles of captains and sailors, are critical. Furthermore, the integration of technologies like telepowering and eurobalise enhances safety measures, while the EU's supremacy in transport policy ensures that member states adhere to these standards, fostering a safer environment for all possessors of transport vehicles.",
