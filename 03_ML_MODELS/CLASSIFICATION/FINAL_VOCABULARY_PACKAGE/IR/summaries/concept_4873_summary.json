  "summary": "Cultural integration, also referred to as acculturation, is a pivotal concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly in the context of fostering social cohesion and promoting diversity. Acculturation involves the processes through which individuals and groups from diverse cultural backgrounds adapt to and integrate into the dominant culture while retaining elements of their original identities. This concept is essential for the EU's policies on migration, social inclusion, and cultural heritage, as it underpins initiatives aimed at enhancing mutual understanding and respect among member states. By prioritizing acculturation, the EU seeks to create an inclusive environment that celebrates cultural diversity while ensuring social harmony.",
