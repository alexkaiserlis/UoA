  "summary": "The concept of \"concentration of the population\" refers to the demographic phenomenon where individuals aggregate in specific geographic areas, often leading to urbanization. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concentration can influence various policies, including regional development, environmental sustainability, and social cohesion. The EU monitors population concentration to address challenges such as infrastructure strain, housing shortages, and service accessibility. Understanding this demographic trend is crucial for formulating effective regulations that promote balanced territorial development and mitigate disparities between urban and rural areas, ensuring equitable resource distribution and fostering inclusive growth across member states.",
