  "summary": "The \"ECSC loan\" refers to financial assistance provided under the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) framework, aimed at supporting steelworks and coal industries across member states. These loans, often subsidized, were designed to aid sectors facing closures or failing to meet competitive intensity. The regulatory discipline surrounding ECSC loans sought to prevent distortions in the market, ensuring that subsidies did not exceed enumerated limits. Exceptions were made for sensitive regions, such as the Mezzogiorno, where economic conditions greatly differed. The relaxation of certain rules allowed for concrete measures to reinforce industry stability, while maintaining a ban on discriminating practices.",
