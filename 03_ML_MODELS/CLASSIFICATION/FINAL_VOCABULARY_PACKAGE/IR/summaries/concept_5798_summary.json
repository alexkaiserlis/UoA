  "summary": "The concept of \"stratospheric pollutant\" pertains to substances that significantly deteriorate the environment, particularly in the stratosphere. In the EU regulatory framework, these include hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs), which are known to deplete the ozone layer. The use of these fluorocarbons is regulated under various directives aimed at reducing their emissions and promoting alternatives, such as metered-dose inhalers that do not contain ozone-depleting substances (ODS). Physicians and environmental advocates are endeavouring to educate the public on the health impacts, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), associated with these pollutants. The EU's commitment to decommissioning harmful substances includes the commercialisation of safer alternatives and the recapture of existing pollutants to mitigate their unacceptably high environmental impact.",
