  "summary": "The term \"surface-to-surface missile\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"guided missile\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Guided missiles are precision weaponry designed to engage targets on the ground from a launch platform, often employed in defense strategies. The regulation of such armaments falls under the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), which aims to ensure the responsible use and proliferation of military technologies. The legal instruments governing these systems focus on compliance with international treaties and the promotion of security within the EU, reflecting a commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the region.",
