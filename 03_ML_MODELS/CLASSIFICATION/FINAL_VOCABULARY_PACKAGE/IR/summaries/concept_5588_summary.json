  "summary": "Social dialogue in the EU context refers to the structured interaction between various actors, including workers, employers, and public authorities, aimed at achieving harmonious labour relations. This dialogue is codified in legal frameworks that promote the dignity of workers and ensure their rights, such as holidays and safe working conditions. The European Trade Union Federation (ETF) plays a pivotal role in this process, sending representatives to negotiate on behalf of workers. The dialogue is characterized by interinstitutional cooperation, where signatories engage in discussions that reflect the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity. By fostering a healthy exchange of ideas, social dialogue illustrates the EU's commitment to achieving fundamental labour rights and enhancing the overall quality of life for workers across member states.",
