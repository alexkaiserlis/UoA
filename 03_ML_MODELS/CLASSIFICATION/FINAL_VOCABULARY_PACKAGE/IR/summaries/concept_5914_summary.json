  "summary": "The term \"psychotropic substance\" refers to a category of compounds that affect mental processes, often leading to alterations in neurochemistry, perception, and behavior. In EU legal and regulatory contexts, substances such as heroin, LSD, and ketamine are classified due to their potential for abuse and associated risks, including overdoses and psychosis. These substances can induce euphoria, hallucinations, and dissociative states, with effects ranging from sedative to stimulant. Regulatory frameworks address compounds like methylenedioxypyrovalerone and methoxetamine, which can lead to adverse effects such as paranoia, auditory hallucinations, and trauma-related dysfunctions. The classification aims to mitigate risks associated with psychopharmacological misuse and ensure public health safety.",
