  "summary": "Water management in agriculture is a crucial aspect of EU regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning the cultivation of agricultural land. The EU emphasizes the need to revise practices to ensure sustainable irrigation techniques that distinguish between less favoured and more productive soils. This includes addressing the challenges faced by regions such as the Mezzogiorno and Corsica, where weather conditions can lead to unbalanced water distribution. Effective drainage and hydraulic systems are essential for maximizing yields on arable hectares, especially in southern areas. The EU encourages cooperatives to embark on collective strategies that reinforce water management, thereby enhancing profitability and ensuring that agricultural practices are both opportune and environmentally sustainable.",
