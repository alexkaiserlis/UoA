  "summary": "Economic liberalism refers to a political and economic philosophy advocating for minimal state intervention in markets, emphasizing free competition and individual entrepreneurship. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, economic liberalism underpins various policies aimed at fostering a single market, promoting trade, and enhancing economic growth. The EU's commitment to economic liberalism is reflected in its competition law, which seeks to prevent monopolistic practices and ensure fair competition among member states. This concept is integral to the EU's regulatory environment, influencing legislation that supports market access and consumer choice while balancing social welfare considerations.",
