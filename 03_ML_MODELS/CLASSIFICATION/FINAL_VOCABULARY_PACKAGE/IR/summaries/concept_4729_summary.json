  "summary": "The concept of \"government violence\" pertains to actions taken by state authorities that may infringe upon individual rights and public safety, raising significant legal and regulatory concerns within the EU framework. Such violence can manifest in various forms, including excessive use of force by law enforcement or military entities, potentially leading to violations of fundamental rights enshrined in EU treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The EU actively monitors and addresses instances of government violence through mechanisms such as the European Court of Human Rights and various regulatory bodies, aiming to uphold democratic principles and ensure accountability for state actions.",
