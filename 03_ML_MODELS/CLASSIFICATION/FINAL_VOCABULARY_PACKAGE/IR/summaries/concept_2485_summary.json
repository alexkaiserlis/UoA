This policy encompasses diplomatic, economic, and regulatory frameworks designed to mitigate tensions and promote stability in regions affected by historical divides. It is particularly relevant in the context of EU enlargement and neighborhood policies, where legal instruments are employed to enhance dialogue and partnership with Eastern European countries. By prioritizing security and collaboration, the East-West policy seeks to create a cohesive European space that upholds democratic values and human rights, thereby reinforcing the EU's role in global governance.",
