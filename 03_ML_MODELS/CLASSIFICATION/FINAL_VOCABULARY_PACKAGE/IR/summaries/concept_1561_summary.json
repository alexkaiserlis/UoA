  "summary": "The concept of \"R?union\" pertains to the overseas countries and territories (OCTs) within the EU framework. It captures the unique insularity and socio-economic dynamics of these regions, where regulatory measures aim to curb immoderate practices, particularly in sectors like alcohols and distilleries. The EU's approach includes periodical assessments to forecasted economic impacts, ensuring undistorted competition. Notably, the cotisation system supports local economies, while the unavailability of certain products, such as rums and boissons alcooliques, can trigger regulatory responses. The overarching goal is to enhance social sécurité and wage equity, addressing handicaps faced by these territories in a global market.",
