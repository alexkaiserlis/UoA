  "summary": "The \"criminal investigation department\" (CID) is an essential component within the organization of the legal system in the EU. It is tasked with conducting thorough inquiries into criminal activities, gathering evidence, and ensuring compliance with legal standards. The CID operates under the jurisdiction of national law enforcement agencies, yet its functions are often influenced by EU regulations aimed at harmonizing criminal justice practices across member states. This alignment facilitates cooperation in transnational investigations, enhancing the efficacy of law enforcement in combating organized crime and terrorism. The CID plays a pivotal role in upholding the rule of law and safeguarding public safety within the EU framework.",
