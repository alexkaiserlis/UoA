  "summary": "The concept of \"large holding\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to farming systems characterized by substantial agricultural land ownership or control. Such holdings often influence market dynamics, agricultural practices, and rural development policies. In EU legislation, large holdings may be subject to specific regulations aimed at ensuring sustainable farming practices, promoting fair competition, and safeguarding biodiversity. Additionally, the management of large holdings is scrutinized to prevent monopolistic behaviors and ensure compliance with environmental standards. Understanding this concept is crucial for policymakers and stakeholders involved in the agricultural sector, as it impacts both economic viability and ecological sustainability.",
