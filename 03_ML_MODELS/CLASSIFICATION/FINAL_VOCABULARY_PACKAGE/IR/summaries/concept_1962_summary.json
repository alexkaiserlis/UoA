  "summary": "The term \"yearbook\" in the context of EU legal and regulatory documentation refers to a comprehensive annual publication that consolidates significant legislative, policy, and regulatory developments within the European Union. These yearbooks serve as essential resources for stakeholders, including policymakers, legal practitioners, and researchers, providing structured insights into the evolving legal landscape. They often encapsulate key decisions, legislative amendments, and statistical data relevant to EU governance. By documenting these elements, the yearbook facilitates informed analysis and understanding of the EU's regulatory framework, thereby enhancing transparency and accountability in the Union's operations.",
