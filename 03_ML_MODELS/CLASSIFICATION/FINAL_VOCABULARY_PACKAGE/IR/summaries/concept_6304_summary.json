  "summary": "The \"precautionary principle\" is a fundamental concept in EU law, particularly relevant in the realms of environmental protection and public health. It posits that in the face of scientific uncertainty regarding potential risks, regulatory authorities should err on the side of caution, taking preventive action to avert harm. This principle is enshrined in various EU directives and regulations, guiding decision-making processes in areas such as chemical safety, biotechnology, and food safety. By prioritizing precaution, the EU aims to safeguard human health and the environment, ensuring that potential hazards are addressed proactively rather than reactively in regulatory frameworks.",
