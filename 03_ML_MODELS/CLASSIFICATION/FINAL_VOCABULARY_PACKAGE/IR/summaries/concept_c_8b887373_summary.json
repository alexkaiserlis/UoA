  "summary": "The \"conditionality regulation,\" also referred to as the \"conditionality mechanism,\" is a pivotal instrument within EU finance aimed at ensuring compliance with established rule of law principles by Member States. This mechanism allows the European Union to impose financial consequences on countries that fail to uphold democratic standards or violate fundamental rights. By linking access to EU funds to adherence to these principles, the regulation seeks to safeguard the integrity of the Union's financial framework. As a redirect, it highlights the broader implications of conditionality in promoting accountability and reinforcing the EU's foundational values across its member jurisdictions.",
