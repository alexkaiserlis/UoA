  "summary": "The concept of \"public morals,\" redirected to the preferred term \"public morality,\" pertains to the ethical standards and societal norms upheld within the European Union. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, public morality serves as a guiding principle, influencing legislation and policy-making, particularly in areas such as consumer protection, public health, and cultural heritage. It reflects the collective values of member states and is often invoked in discussions surrounding freedom of expression, censorship, and the regulation of content. The interplay between public morality and individual rights underscores the EU's commitment to balancing societal interests with personal freedoms in a diverse legal landscape.",
