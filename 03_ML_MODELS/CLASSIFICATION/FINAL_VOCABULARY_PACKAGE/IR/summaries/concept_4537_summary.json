  "summary": "The concept of \"underground transport\" pertains to the organization of transport systems within the European Union, specifically focusing on subterranean transit modalities. This includes the regulatory frameworks governing the construction, operation, and safety standards of underground railways, subways, and other subterranean transport infrastructures. EU directives and regulations aim to harmonize safety protocols, environmental assessments, and operational efficiency across member states. The legal framework ensures that underground transport systems are integrated into broader transport networks, promoting sustainable mobility and accessibility while addressing challenges such as urban congestion and environmental impact.",
