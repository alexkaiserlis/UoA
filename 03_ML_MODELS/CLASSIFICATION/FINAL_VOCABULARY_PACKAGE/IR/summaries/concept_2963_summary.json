  "summary": "In EU regulatory frameworks, \"thickener,\" a redirect term for \"texture agent,\" refers to substances that enhance the viscosity and mouthfeel of food products. These agents, such as xanthan and alginate, are crucial in creating creamier textures and preventing lumps in various formulations. They interact with other components, including emulsifiers and coagulants, to form stable dispersions. Common thickeners include pectin, tragacanth, and various clays like kaolinitic and sepiolitic types. Regulatory scrutiny also extends to their safety profiles, particularly concerning hypercholesterolaemic effects and permissible levels of sulphites. Understanding these agents is vital for compliance with EU food technology standards.",
