  "summary": "The concept of \"alternative service\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework refers to non-traditional methods of delivering legal documents, particularly in the context of defence. This approach is significant in ensuring that parties involved in legal proceedings receive necessary notifications without relying solely on conventional means, such as personal delivery or postal services. Alternative service can include electronic methods or publication in official gazettes, thereby enhancing accessibility and efficiency in legal processes. Its implementation is governed by specific regulations that aim to balance the rights of defendants with the need for effective judicial procedures, particularly in cross-border cases.",
