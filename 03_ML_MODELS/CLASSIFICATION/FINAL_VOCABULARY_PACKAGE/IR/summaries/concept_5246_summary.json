  "summary": "The \"Autonomous Province of Bolzano,\" categorized under regions of EU Member States, plays a crucial role in the legal and regulatory frameworks concerning agricultural and veterinary practices. This province has successfully initiated vaccination programs aimed at eradicating infectious diseases such as rhinotracheitis and Aujeszky's disease in bovines and pigs. The EU supports these efforts through various funding mechanisms, including the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF). Documentation and compliance with compulsory veterinary regulations are essential for secure movements of livestock, ensuring that Bolzano remains a source of healthy animals while prioritizing rural development and partnerships in disease eradication efforts.",
