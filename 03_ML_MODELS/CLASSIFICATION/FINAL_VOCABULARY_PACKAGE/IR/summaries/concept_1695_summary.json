  "summary": "Subsidised housing, a term redirected from \"subsidized housing,\" refers to residential accommodations that receive financial support from governmental bodies to make them affordable for low-income individuals and families. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, subsidised housing is integral to urban development policies aimed at promoting social inclusion and combating homelessness. The European Union encourages member states to implement regulations that facilitate the construction and planning of subsidised housing projects, ensuring compliance with sustainability and accessibility standards. This concept is crucial for fostering equitable access to housing within the EU, aligning with broader socio-economic objectives.",
