  "summary": "The \"special legislative procedure\" is a distinct mechanism within the European Union's legislative framework, diverging from the ordinary legislative procedure. It is characterized by the involvement of specific institutions, such as the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, which may have varying degrees of influence over the legislative process. This procedure is typically employed for sensitive matters, including those related to the Common Foreign and Security Policy or budgetary issues. The special legislative procedure ensures that certain legislative acts are adopted with enhanced scrutiny, reflecting the complexity and significance of the issues at hand in EU law.",
