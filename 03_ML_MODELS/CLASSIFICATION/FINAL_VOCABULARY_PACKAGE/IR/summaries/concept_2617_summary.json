  "summary": "The \"primacy of the law\" is a fundamental principle in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, asserting that law takes precedence over other forms of governance and policy. This concept ensures that all actions and decisions made by EU institutions adhere to established legal norms, thereby safeguarding the rule of law. In practice, it means that EU law supersedes national laws in cases of conflict, promoting uniformity and coherence across member states. The primacy of the law is essential for maintaining legal certainty and protecting the rights of individuals, thereby reinforcing the integrity of the EU legal order and its regulatory mechanisms.",
