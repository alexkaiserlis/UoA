  "summary": "Multilingualism is a fundamental principle within the European Union's legal and regulatory framework, reflecting the Union's commitment to linguistic diversity and cultural heritage. It ensures that all official documents, legislation, and communications are accessible in multiple languages, thereby promoting inclusivity and understanding among member states. This principle is vital for the effective functioning of EU institutions, enabling citizens to engage with EU law and policy in their native languages. Multilingualism also fosters cooperation and dialogue among diverse cultures, enhancing the democratic legitimacy of the EU. Consequently, it plays a crucial role in the integration and cohesion of the Union.",
