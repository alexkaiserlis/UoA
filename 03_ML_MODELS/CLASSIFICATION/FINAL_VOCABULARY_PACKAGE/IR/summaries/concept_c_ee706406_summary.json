  "summary": "The term \"food contact material\" refers to any substance or article intended to come into contact with food, encompassing a wide range of materials such as plastics, paper, and metals. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, food contact materials are subject to stringent safety assessments to ensure they do not transfer harmful constituents to food. The European Regulation (EC) No. 1935/2004 establishes the fundamental safety requirements for these materials, mandating compliance with specific migration limits and overall safety evaluations. This regulatory oversight aims to protect consumer health and ensure the integrity of agri-foodstuffs within the EU market.",
