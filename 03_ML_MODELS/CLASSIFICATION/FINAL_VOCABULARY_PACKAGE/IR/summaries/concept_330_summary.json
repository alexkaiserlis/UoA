  "summary": "Self-sufficiency farming refers to agricultural practices aimed at producing sufficient food and resources to meet the needs of a household or community without reliance on external markets. Within the EU regulatory framework, this concept aligns with policies promoting sustainable agriculture, food security, and rural development. The European Union encourages self-sufficiency farming through various programs and funding mechanisms, emphasizing the importance of local production systems. By fostering resilience in agricultural activities, self-sufficiency farming contributes to environmental sustainability and enhances the socio-economic fabric of rural areas, thereby supporting the EU's broader objectives of promoting sustainable development and reducing dependency on imports.",
