  "summary": "The \"market abuse regulation\" (MAR) is a pivotal EU legal framework aimed at preventing market abuse, which encompasses insider trading and market manipulation. As a redirect to the preferred term \"market abuse,\" MAR establishes stringent rules to ensure transparency and integrity in financial markets. It delineates the obligations of market participants, enhances investor protection, and fosters fair competition. The regulation empowers regulatory authorities to impose sanctions for violations, thereby reinforcing confidence in the financial system. By harmonizing legal standards across Member States, MAR plays a crucial role in safeguarding the stability and reliability of the EU's capital markets.",
