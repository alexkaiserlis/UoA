  "summary": "The concept of \"right to euthanasia,\" categorized under \"rights and freedoms,\" pertains to the legal and ethical discourse surrounding the practice of euthanasia within the European Union. Euthanasia, often viewed through the lens of individual autonomy and dignity, raises complex legal questions regarding the balance between state interests and personal rights. While EU member states have varying regulations, the overarching discourse emphasizes the need for harmonization of legal frameworks to protect individuals' rights. As a redirect to the preferred term \"euthanasia,\" this concept encapsulates the ongoing debates about the legitimacy and regulation of assisted dying in the EU context.",
