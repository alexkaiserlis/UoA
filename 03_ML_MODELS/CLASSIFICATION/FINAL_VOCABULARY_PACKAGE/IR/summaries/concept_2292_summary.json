  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"supply\" pertains to the management and delivery of goods, particularly agricultural products, within various territories. It encompasses the establishment of licenses and regulations that govern the distribution of consumable items, such as milkpowder and pigfeed, ensuring that the needs of victuallers are met. The EU's approach to supply also addresses eventualities and scarcety, implementing arrangements that respond to situaciones de emergencia. Opinions on supply chain management emphasize the importance of centralizing efforts to cope with immediate necessities, thereby enhancing the resilience of agricultural sectors across member states.",
