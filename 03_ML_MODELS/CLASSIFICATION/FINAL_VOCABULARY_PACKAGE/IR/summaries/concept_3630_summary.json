  "summary": "Public insurance refers to a system of insurance coverage provided by government entities, aimed at ensuring access to essential services and financial protection for citizens. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, public insurance plays a crucial role in social welfare policies, often encompassing health, unemployment, and pension schemes. It is designed to mitigate risks and promote social equity by distributing financial burdens across the population. The EU encourages member states to maintain robust public insurance systems as part of their commitment to social cohesion and economic stability, ensuring that all individuals have access to necessary protections against unforeseen events.",
