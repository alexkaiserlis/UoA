  "summary": "The concept of \"biography\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory documents refers to a comprehensive account of an individual's life, particularly as it pertains to their professional qualifications and contributions to public service. In regulatory frameworks, biographies serve as essential documentation, providing insights into the backgrounds of key officials and decision-makers. This information is crucial for transparency and accountability in governance, allowing stakeholders to assess the expertise and integrity of individuals involved in EU institutions. Thus, biographies play a significant role in fostering trust and informed participation in the EU's regulatory processes.",
