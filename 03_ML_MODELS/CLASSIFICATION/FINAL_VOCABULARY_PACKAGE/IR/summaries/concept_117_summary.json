  "summary": "The concept of \"adoption of a child\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the formal process by which an individual or couple becomes the legal parent(s) of a child, thereby establishing a permanent parent-child relationship. This process is governed by national laws, which must align with EU principles, particularly regarding the best interests of the child and non-discrimination. Adoption procedures vary across Member States, reflecting diverse cultural and legal traditions. The EU promotes harmonization of adoption practices to ensure child welfare, safeguard rights, and facilitate cross-border adoptions, thereby enhancing legal certainty and protecting the rights of all parties involved.",
