  "summary": "Audiovisual piracy refers to the illicit reproduction and distribution of phonographic and audiovisual works, including music, films, and recordings, without the consent of copyright holders. This form of piracy has intensified with the rise of digital media, leading to significant losses for artists and the music industry, as evidenced by campaigns from organizations like IFPI. The EU has enacted stringent regulations to combat such infringements, ensuring compliance with international treaties like the Berne Convention. Despite these efforts, the resurgence of piracy remains a challenge, as infringers continue to violate intellectual property rights, necessitating robust enforcement measures and parliamentary oversight to protect artistic repertoire effectively.",
