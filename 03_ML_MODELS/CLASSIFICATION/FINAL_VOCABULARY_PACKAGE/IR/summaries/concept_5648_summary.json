  "summary": "\"Fraud against the EU\" encompasses various unlawful activities that undermine the financial interests of the European Union. This includes misconduct related to the misuse of funds, where prosecutors may pursue actions against individuals or entities involved in such dereliction. The concept is circumscribed by regulations ensuring the inviolability of EU resources, with outputs subject to rigorous valuations. Regrettably, instances of fraud can lead to obsolescence in trust and privilege within EU institutions. Legal proceedings aim to redress these issues, ensuring that all activities align with the principles of sincerity and accountability, ultimately safeguarding the integrity of EU buildings and archives.",
