  "summary": "The concept of \"stabilisation of export earnings,\" commonly referred to as \"Stabex,\" is a regulatory mechanism established within the framework of the EU's association with African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries. It aims to stabilize the earnings from exported commodities by guaranteeing transfers to countries whose export revenues fall below predetermined bases. The Stabex system stipulates that, in cases where earnings exceed calculated thresholds, financial support is provided to mitigate the adverse effects of fluctuating market prices. This mechanism is crucial for ensuring that ACP territories can maintain economic stability, particularly in months where earnings are reduced, thus fostering sustainable development and commitments to long-term partnerships.",
