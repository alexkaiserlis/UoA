  "summary": "The concept of \"birth policy\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to demographic strategies aimed at influencing population growth and addressing challenges related to fertility rates. Birth policies may encompass a range of measures, including financial incentives for families, parental leave regulations, and support for childcare services. These policies are crucial for maintaining demographic balance, ensuring sustainable development, and addressing the socio-economic implications of an aging population. The EU encourages member states to adopt comprehensive birth policies that align with broader objectives of social cohesion and economic stability, thereby fostering a supportive environment for family growth and demographic resilience.",
