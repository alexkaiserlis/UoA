  "summary": "Transhumanism, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the interdisciplinary study and advocacy for the enhancement of human capabilities through advanced technologies. This concept intersects with research and intellectual property rights, raising critical questions about the ethical implications of genetic modification, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology. The EU must navigate complex regulatory landscapes to ensure that innovations align with fundamental rights and public safety. As transhumanism evolves, it necessitates a robust legal framework to address issues such as consent, ownership of intellectual property, and the potential societal impacts of human enhancement technologies.",
