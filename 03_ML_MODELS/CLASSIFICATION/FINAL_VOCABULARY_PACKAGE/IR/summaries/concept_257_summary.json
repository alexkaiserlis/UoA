  "summary": "The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) is a pivotal judicial body established to adjudicate on matters concerning the protection of human rights within the jurisdiction of its member states. It operates under the auspices of the Council of Europe, distinct from EU institutions, and its rulings are binding on states that have ratified the European Convention on Human Rights. The ECHR plays a crucial role in ensuring compliance with fundamental rights and freedoms, influencing EU legal frameworks by reinforcing the rule of law and promoting democratic principles across Europe. Its decisions contribute significantly to the development of human rights jurisprudence.",
