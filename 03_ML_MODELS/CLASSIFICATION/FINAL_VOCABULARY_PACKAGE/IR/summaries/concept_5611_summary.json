  "summary": "The concept of \"institutional balance\" within the European Union (EU) refers to the distribution of powers and responsibilities among its key institutions, namely the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council of the European Union. This balance is crucial for ensuring that no single institution dominates the legislative process, thereby maintaining democratic legitimacy and accountability. The institutional balance is enshrined in EU treaties and underpins the functioning of the EU's regulatory framework. It fosters cooperation and dialogue among institutions, facilitating effective governance while respecting the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality in policy-making.",
