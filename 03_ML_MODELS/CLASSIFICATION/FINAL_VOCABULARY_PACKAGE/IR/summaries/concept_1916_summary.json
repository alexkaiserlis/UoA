  "summary": "Internal migration refers to the movement of individuals within the borders of a Member State of the European Union. This phenomenon is significant in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, as it impacts various socio-economic factors such as labor markets, housing policies, and social integration. The EU promotes internal migration through policies aimed at enhancing mobility and ensuring equal access to opportunities across regions. Legal instruments, such as the EU's Freedom of Movement Directive, facilitate this process, allowing citizens to reside and work in any Member State. Understanding internal migration is essential for addressing regional disparities and fostering cohesion within the EU.",
