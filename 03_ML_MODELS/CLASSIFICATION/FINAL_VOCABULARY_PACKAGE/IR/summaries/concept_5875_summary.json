  "summary": "Royalism, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to a political ideology advocating for the monarchy as a legitimate form of governance. This concept underscores the historical and constitutional significance of royal institutions in member states, influencing national legal structures and political discourse. While the EU primarily operates on principles of democracy and republicanism, the presence of royalist sentiments can impact legislative processes and public policy debates. Royalism may also intersect with discussions on sovereignty, governance, and the role of traditional institutions in modern European politics, reflecting the diverse political landscape across the Union.",
