  "summary": "\"Detention before trial\" refers to the legal process whereby an individual is held in custody prior to the commencement of their trial. In the context of EU law, this concept is governed by principles aimed at ensuring the protection of fundamental rights, including the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has established that pre-trial detention must be justified, proportionate, and subject to judicial oversight. EU regulations emphasize the necessity of minimizing the use of detention before trial, advocating for alternatives such as bail or supervision to uphold individual liberties while ensuring public safety.",
