  "summary": "A \"parliamentary question\" is a formal inquiry posed by a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) to the European Commission or the Council of the EU. This mechanism serves as a vital tool for MEPs to seek clarification, accountability, and transparency regarding legislative actions and policy implementations. Parliamentary questions can address various issues, including regulatory compliance, legal interpretations, and the functioning of EU institutions. By facilitating dialogue between elected representatives and executive bodies, parliamentary questions enhance democratic oversight and contribute to the EU's commitment to participatory governance. This process underscores the importance of accountability within the EU's legal framework.",
