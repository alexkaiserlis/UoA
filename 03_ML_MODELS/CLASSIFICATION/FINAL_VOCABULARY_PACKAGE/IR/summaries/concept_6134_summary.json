  "summary": "Comparative advertising refers to the practice of promoting a product or service by directly comparing it to a competitor's offering. Within the EU legal framework, it is governed by the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive and the Advertising Directive, which establish criteria to ensure that such advertising is not misleading or disparaging. The regulations aim to foster fair competition while allowing businesses to inform consumers effectively. Comparative advertising must be substantiated, truthful, and not create confusion about the products being compared. This legal concept is crucial for maintaining a balanced competitive environment in the EU market.",
