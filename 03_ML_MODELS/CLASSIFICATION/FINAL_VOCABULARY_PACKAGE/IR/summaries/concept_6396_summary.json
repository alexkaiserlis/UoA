  "summary": "Environmental economics is a critical component of EU environmental policy, focusing on the economic implications of environmental decisions and regulations. It encompasses the assessment of resource allocation, cost-benefit analysis, and the valuation of ecosystem services. This discipline informs the development of regulatory frameworks aimed at achieving sustainable development while mitigating environmental degradation. The EU employs environmental economics to evaluate the effectiveness of policies such as the European Green Deal, which aims to transition to a circular economy. By integrating economic principles with environmental objectives, the EU seeks to foster a resilient economy that prioritizes ecological sustainability.",
