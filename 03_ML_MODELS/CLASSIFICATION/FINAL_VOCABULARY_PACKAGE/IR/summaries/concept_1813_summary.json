  "summary": "The concept of \"Marches\" pertains to regions within EU Member States characterized by unique socio-economic frameworks and geographical features. These areas often face challenges such as declining populations and economic modernization. The EU's regulatory frameworks, including the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), foresees allocations aimed at safeguarding these regions' additionality and readiness for sustainable development. The statutory intent is to enhance local practices, including livestock sectors like sheepmeat and goatmeat, through indexed loans and supportive measures. The programming phases adopt inclusive perspectives, ensuring unused resources are effectively mobilized to satisfy local needs and promote economic resilience.",
