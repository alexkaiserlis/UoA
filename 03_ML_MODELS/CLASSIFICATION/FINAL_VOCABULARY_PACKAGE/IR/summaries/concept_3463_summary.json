  "summary": "A \"multilateral treaty,\" often referred to as a \"multilateral agreement,\" is a legal instrument involving multiple signatory states that collectively establish obligations and rights across various domains, including international trade and aviation. In the EU context, such agreements facilitate cooperation in areas like procurement and transportation, ensuring legality and compliance with prevailing regulations. For instance, the General Procurement Agreement (GPA) under the WTO framework illustrates how multilateral treaties can incorporate clauses that enhance dialogue among member states. These treaties may also address specific sectors, such as airlines and waterway operations, reflecting a desire for joint regulation and coverage of mobile personnel and passengers. By drafting comprehensive appendices, these agreements ensure that all parties, including those from nations like Montenegro and New Zealand, are aligned in their commitments and operational standards, fostering a cohesive regulatory environment.",
