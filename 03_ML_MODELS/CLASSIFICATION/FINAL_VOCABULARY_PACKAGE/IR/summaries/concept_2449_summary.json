  "summary": "The \"trade system,\" as a redirect to \"trade policy,\" encompasses the EU's regulatory framework governing international trade relations. This policy aims to attract investments and enhance market access, ensuring that member states operate according to established understandings of reciprocity. It addresses various sectors, including wineries and distillers, by regulating the import and export of goods such as cocoa and lactalbumin. The EU's trade policy also involves waiving tariffs and managing quotas, with provisions for distillatin and anthracite, while ensuring compliance with international standards set by bodies like UNCTAD. By ratifying agreements, the EU seeks to afford member states a competitive advantage, thereby yielding favourable outcomes in a deteriorating global trade landscape.",
