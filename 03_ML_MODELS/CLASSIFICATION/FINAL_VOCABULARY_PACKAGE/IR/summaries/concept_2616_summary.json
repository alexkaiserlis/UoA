  "summary": "The concept of \"economic prospects,\" redirected to \"economic forecasting,\" plays a critical role in EU regulatory frameworks, particularly in assessing the implications of climate policies and market liberalisation. Regulators, such as ESMA, systematically analyse economic indicators to validate assumptions and ensure the accuracy of forecasts. This rigorous appraisal involves reviewing methodologies that gather historical data and respond to challenges posed by greenhouse emissions and dependency on energy sources. The endorsement of these forecasts is essential for stakeholders, as they outline the correlation between economic performance and climate initiatives, such as those discussed in the Kyoto and Copenhagen agreements. Periodically, these analyses are launched to ensure thorough oversight and prevent duplication in reporting.",
