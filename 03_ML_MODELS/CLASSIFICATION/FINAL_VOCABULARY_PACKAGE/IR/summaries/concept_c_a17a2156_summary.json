  "summary": "The concept of \"web of data,\" commonly referred to as the \"semantic web,\" pertains to the structured interlinking of data across the internet, enhancing the accessibility and interoperability of information. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, the semantic web facilitates improved data sharing and retrieval, enabling stakeholders to navigate complex legal frameworks efficiently. By employing standardized data formats and ontologies, the semantic web supports the integration of diverse legal information sources, fostering transparency and compliance.
