  "summary": "The concept of \"administrative structures\" within the EU legal framework encompasses the organization and functioning of executive power and public service. These structures are essential for ensuring impartial governance and effective public administration, broadening the scope of democratic engagement. The computerization and automation of processes enhance transparency and efficiency, addressing issues of maladministration. Various entities, such as the Ombudsman and OLAF, play critical roles in overseeing compliance and conducting inquiries. The interdependence of administrative bodies, facilitated by networking and thematic panels, ensures that mandates are met while accommodating the diverse occupations of public service. This harmonization supports the EUâ€™s objectives in areas such as environmental sustainability, where the management of nutrients and vitamins is crucial. Ultimately, these structures are vital for maintaining openness and accountability in the EU's regulatory landscape.",
