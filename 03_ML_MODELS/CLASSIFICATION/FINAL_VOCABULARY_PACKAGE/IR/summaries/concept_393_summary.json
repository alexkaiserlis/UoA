  "summary": "The concept of \"food expenditure\" pertains to the financial outlay associated with the consumption of food within the European Union. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, food expenditure is a critical factor influencing agricultural policies, consumer protection regulations, and food security initiatives. It encompasses various dimensions, including household spending patterns, market dynamics, and the impact of EU legislation on food pricing and availability. Understanding food expenditure is essential for policymakers to ensure compliance with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and to address socio-economic disparities across member states, thereby fostering sustainable consumption practices within the EU.",
