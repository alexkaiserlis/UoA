  "summary": "\"Regional accounting\" refers to the systematic collection and analysis of economic data at a subnational level within the European Union. This concept is integral to national accounts, as it provides insights into regional economic performance, enabling policymakers to assess disparities and allocate resources effectively. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, regional accounting supports compliance with regulations aimed at cohesion and economic convergence among member states. By facilitating a detailed understanding of regional economies, it aids in the formulation of targeted interventions and the evaluation of the impact of EU funding programs, thus enhancing overall economic governance.",
