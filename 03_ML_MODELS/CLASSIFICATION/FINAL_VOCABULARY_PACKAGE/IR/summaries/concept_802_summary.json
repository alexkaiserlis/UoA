  "summary": "A \"restrictive trade practice\" refers to unwritten agreements or behaviors among companies that limit competition, often leading to contestation in the market. Such practices can include solicitation of clients, price-fixing, or other forms of collusion that may not be immediately apparent. In the EU, these practices are scrutinized under competition law to ensure an equalized economic environment. Legalization efforts aim to amend existing regulations, addressing issues raised by stakeholders, including jobbers and brokers. Companies found engaging in restrictive practices may face lawsuits or penalties, impacting their providence in the market. The EU periodically tests these regulations to adapt to changing economic conditions.",
