  "summary": "The concept of \"sexual offence\" within EU criminal law encompasses a range of unlawful acts that violate an individual's sexual autonomy and integrity. These offences are subject to varying definitions and penalties across member states, reflecting diverse legal traditions and cultural contexts. The EU has initiated frameworks to harmonize legislation and enhance cooperation among jurisdictions, particularly through directives aimed at combating violence against women and children. This regulatory approach seeks to ensure that victims receive adequate protection and support, while offenders are held accountable. The term is critical in discussions surrounding human rights, public safety, and legal reform across the Union.",
