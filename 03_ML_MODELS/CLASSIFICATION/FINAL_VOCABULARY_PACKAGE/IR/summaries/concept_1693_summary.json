  "summary": "The concept of \"villa,\" categorized under construction and town planning, is a redirect to the preferred term \"single-family housing.\" In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, single-family housing refers to residential structures designed for occupancy by a single household, often characterized by their architectural style and spatial configuration. Regulations governing single-family housing encompass zoning laws, building codes, and environmental assessments, ensuring compliance with urban planning standards. These regulations aim to promote sustainable development, enhance community cohesion, and preserve cultural heritage within residential areas. Understanding this term is crucial for stakeholders involved in urban development and housing policy across the EU.",
