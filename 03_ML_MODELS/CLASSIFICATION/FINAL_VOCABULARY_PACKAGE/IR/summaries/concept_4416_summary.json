  "summary": "Food technology encompasses the application of scientific principles to the production, preservation, and distribution of food within the EU regulatory framework. It includes the use of enzymatic processes, such as betaglucanase, to enhance the nutritional profile of products like petfoods and sugary snacks. Regulatory standards ensure that food producers comply with safety measures, addressing potential inaccuracies related to contaminants like trichina and ensuring that products remain unimpaired during processing. The EU also regulates the use of cryogenic techniques and the vinified processes in beverages like glühwein. Additionally, food technology innovations must consider the porosity of packaging materials and the implications of using acidified ingredients, ensuring that caterers and canteens provide safe, compliant meals.",
