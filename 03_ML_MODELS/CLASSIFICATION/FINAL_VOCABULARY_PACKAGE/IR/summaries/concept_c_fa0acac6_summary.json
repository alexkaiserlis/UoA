The EU has implemented various directives aimed at minimizing food waste, thereby promoting sustainability and environmental protection. These regulations encourage member states to adopt measures that reduce food surplus and enhance food recovery processes. By addressing food waste, the EU aims to mitigate its adverse effects on the environment, including greenhouse gas emissions and resource depletion. Effective management of food waste is essential for achieving the EU's broader environmental objectives and commitments under international agreements.",
