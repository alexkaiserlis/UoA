  "summary": "In EU criminal law, \"aggravating circumstances\" refer to specific factors that increase the severity of a crime, thereby leading to harsher penalties. These circumstances can include elements such as premeditation, the vulnerability of the victim, or the use of excessive violence. The presence of aggravating circumstances is crucial in judicial proceedings, as they inform the court's discretion in sentencing. By identifying these factors, legal frameworks aim to ensure proportionality in punishment and enhance deterrence. Understanding aggravating circumstances is essential for legal practitioners and policymakers in shaping effective criminal justice responses within the EU.",
