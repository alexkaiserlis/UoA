  "summary": "Multilateralism, often redirected to \"multilateral relations,\" is a pivotal concept in EU international affairs, emphasizing cooperation among multiple states to address global challenges. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, multilateral relations facilitate the establishment of treaties, agreements, and collaborative mechanisms that enhance diplomatic engagement and promote shared objectives. The EU actively participates in multilateral forums, reinforcing its commitment to collective action on issues such as trade, security, and environmental sustainability. This approach not only strengthens the EU's global presence but also fosters a rules-based international order, essential for effective governance and conflict resolution.",
