  "summary": "Eugenics, a concept rooted in the manipulation of genetic traits, raises significant ethical and legal concerns within the EU regulatory framework. Historically associated with controversial practices aimed at improving human populations, eugenics intersects with various legal domains, including bioethics, human rights, and public health. The EU's commitment to safeguarding individual dignity and preventing discrimination informs its regulatory stance against eugenics-related practices. Legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) emphasizes the protection of genetic data, reflecting a broader commitment to ethical standards in scientific research. Consequently, eugenics remains a critical topic in discussions on genetic engineering and biotechnological advancements within the EU.",
