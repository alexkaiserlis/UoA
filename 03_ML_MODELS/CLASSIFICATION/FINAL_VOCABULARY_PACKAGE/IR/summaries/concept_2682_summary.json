  "summary": "The \"guaranteed minimum price\" is a regulatory mechanism within the EU aimed at ensuring remunerative returns for farmers by establishing a baseline price for agricultural products. This concept is particularly significant for commodities such as maize, tomatoes, and various fruits like figs and grapes, which can be affected by climatic deviations. The mechanism allows processors to buy unprocessed goods at a price that largely mitigates the impact of inflation and market fluctuations. By adopting coefficients that account for differing production costs, the EU manages to retain stability in the market, thereby supporting farmers in regions like Conakry and the Canary Islands. This ensures that producers of tinned and dried products, such as prunes and pineapple juice, can compete effectively while maintaining a sustainable agricultural sector.",
