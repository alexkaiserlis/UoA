  "summary": "The term \"Carifta\" refers to the Caribbean Free Trade Association, which has been superseded by \"Caricom,\" the preferred term for the Caribbean Community. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, Caricom plays a significant role in fostering economic integration and cooperation among member states, thereby enhancing trade relations with the EU. The transition from Carifta to Caricom reflects a broader commitment to regional development and collaboration, aligning with EU objectives of promoting sustainable economic growth and stability in extra-European organisations. Understanding this relationship is crucial for interpreting EU policies related to international trade and regional partnerships.",
