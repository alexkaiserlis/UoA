  "summary": "The concept of \"internal religious law,\" also referred to as the \"internal law of religions,\" pertains to the legal frameworks governing the practices and governance of religious communities within the European Union. This internal law operates independently of state law, allowing religious organizations to establish their own rules, rituals, and governance structures. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, understanding internal religious law is crucial for addressing issues of religious freedom, autonomy, and the interplay between national legal systems and the rights of religious entities. This redirect highlights the preferred term for clarity in legal discourse.",
