  "summary": "The term \"civilian victim\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to individuals who encounter harm during conflicts, particularly in regions like Iraq and the former Yugoslavia. The EU, through its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), addresses the urgent need to protect such victims, often collaborating with organizations like the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). This includes initiatives to dispose of landmines and provide humanitarian aid, ensuring that surplus resources, such as food (rice, oils, vegetables), are tendered effectively. The EU's commitment to supporting civilian victims is reflected in its charitable actions and the awarding of tenders for aid in conflict-affected areas, thereby addressing the anticipated needs of these vulnerable populations.",
