  "summary": "A \"turnkey factory\" refers to an industrial structure designed to be fully operational upon completion, requiring minimal additional input from the buyer. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, turnkey factories are significant for fostering efficient industrial development and investment. They facilitate compliance with EU standards on safety, environmental impact, and operational efficiency. The concept is particularly relevant in public procurement and infrastructure projects, where EU regulations mandate transparency and competitiveness. By streamlining the construction and operational phases, turnkey factories can enhance productivity and support the EU's broader industrial policy objectives, promoting sustainable economic growth across member states.",
