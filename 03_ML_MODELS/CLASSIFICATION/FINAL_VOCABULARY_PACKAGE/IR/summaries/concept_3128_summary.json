  "summary": "\"Selective hunting,\" a term redirecting to \"hunting regulations,\" encompasses the EU's legal framework governing the hunting of wild fauna. As regulations evolve, they aim to balance the welfare of wildlife with human interests, ensuring that hunting practices do not negatively impact biodiversity. This includes prohibiting certain methods, such as leghold traps, which can lead to inhumane treatment of animals. The EU negotiates internationally to standardize hunting regulations, offering options that satisfy both conservation goals and economic incentives. By certifying humane practices and regulating the capture of furs and pelts, the EU seeks to guarantee the welfare of trapped animals while managing hunting sustainably.",
