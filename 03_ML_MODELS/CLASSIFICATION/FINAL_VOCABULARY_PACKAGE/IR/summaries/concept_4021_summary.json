  "summary": "The \"tertiary sector,\" a crucial component of the economic structure within the EU, encompasses various service-oriented industries, including audiovisual and broadcasting. This sector presupposes a need for robust infrastructures and methodologies to support employers and employees alike. In formulating regulatory frameworks, the EU often highlights the necessity for liberalization and simplification of processes, which can include waivers and variations in coverage. By analysing earnings and variables within the tertiary sector, policymakers can compile exhaustive inventories that address gaps and prospects for growth. The Doha and Marrakesh agendas further emphasize the importance of this sector in global economic discussions, necessitating a comprehensive approach to ensure reasonable wages and employment opportunities.",
