  "summary": "Military science encompasses the systematic study of military operations, strategies, and technologies, forming a critical component of defense policy within the European Union. This discipline informs regulatory frameworks and legal standards governing military engagement, interoperability among member states, and the development of defense capabilities. In the context of EU legal documents, military science underpins initiatives aimed at enhancing collective security, fostering cooperation in defense research, and ensuring compliance with international humanitarian law. By integrating military science into regulatory practices, the EU seeks to bolster its strategic autonomy while promoting peace and stability across the region.",
