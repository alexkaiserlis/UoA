  "summary": "The concept of \"winegrowers' cooperative,\" categorized under farming systems, is redirected to the preferred term \"agricultural cooperative.\" These cooperatives play a crucial role in stabilizing the ailing agricultural sector by enabling winegrowers to collectively manage resources, thus neutralising market instability. They operate under stipulations that promote fair practices, ensuring that members can defray costs and share profits. In the EU regulatory framework, these cooperatives are essential for rescuing unprofitable vineyards and fostering sustainable landscapes. Their existence is vital for maintaining the scenic beauty of regions like Liguria, where the roots of tradition and modernity intertwine, truly enhancing the agricultural landscape.",
