  "summary": "In the context of the EU legal system, a \"notary\" is a public official empowered to perform various legal formalities, including the authentication of documents, witnessing signatures, and certifying the legality of transactions. Notaries play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of legal processes and the protection of parties' rights within the framework of civil law jurisdictions. Their functions are governed by national regulations, which must align with EU directives to facilitate cross-border legal transactions. The notarial profession thus serves as a vital link in the organization of the legal system, promoting legal certainty and trust in public and private dealings across member states.",
