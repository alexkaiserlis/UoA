  "summary": "A \"refugee facility\" refers to a designated location established within the European Union to provide shelter, support, and processing for individuals seeking asylum. These facilities are integral to the EU's international security framework, ensuring compliance with legal obligations under the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). They serve as critical points for the assessment of refugee claims, offering necessary resources such as legal assistance and social services. By facilitating the integration of refugees, these facilities also aim to uphold human rights standards while addressing security concerns associated with migration flows. Their operation is governed by EU regulations and directives that prioritize both protection and security.",
