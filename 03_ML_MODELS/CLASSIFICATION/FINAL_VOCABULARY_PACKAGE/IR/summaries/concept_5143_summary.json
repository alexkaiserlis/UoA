  "summary": "The \"contiguous zone\" is a maritime zone recognized under international law, extending beyond a state's territorial sea, typically up to 24 nautical miles from the baseline. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this zone allows states to exercise limited sovereignty, particularly for the enforcement of customs, immigration, and sanitary regulations. The contiguous zone serves as a buffer for states to prevent and punish violations of their laws within adjacent waters. This concept is crucial for EU member states, as it impacts maritime security, environmental protection, and the regulation of fishing activities in adjacent waters.",
