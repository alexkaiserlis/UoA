  "summary": "The concept of \"staff shortage,\" redirected to \"labour shortage,\" pertains to the challenges faced within the EU labour market, particularly regarding the insufficient availability of qualified personnel to meet economic demands. This phenomenon can hinder productivity and economic growth, prompting regulatory responses at both national and EU levels. Legal frameworks may be established to address such shortages, including policies aimed at enhancing workforce mobility, promoting vocational training, and facilitating immigration of skilled workers. Understanding \"labour shortage\" is crucial for policymakers to develop effective strategies that ensure a balanced and efficient labour market, ultimately supporting the EU's economic stability and competitiveness.",
