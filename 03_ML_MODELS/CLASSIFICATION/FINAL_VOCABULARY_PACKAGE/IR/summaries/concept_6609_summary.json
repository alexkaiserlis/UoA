  "summary": "Voluntary regulation, also known as self-regulation, refers to a framework where participants within specific sectors, such as diamond trading or environmental sustainability, establish norms and standards without formal legislative mandates. In the EU context, this approach allows for the rectifying of issues efficiently, as seen in the bourse for diamonds, where countries like Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo engage in self-regulatory practices. Such frameworks can enhance functionality and reliability, fostering cooperation among member states, including those from the Arab Emirates to Taiwan. By validating practices and lifting formalities, self-regulation promotes outstanding compliance and adaptability in diverse sectors, ensuring that participants can address challenges effectively.",
