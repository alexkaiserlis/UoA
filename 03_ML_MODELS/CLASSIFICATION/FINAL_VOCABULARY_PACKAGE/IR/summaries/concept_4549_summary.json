  "summary": "\"Undeclared work,\" commonly referred to as \"moonlighting,\" encompasses employment activities that are not reported to tax authorities or social security systems. This practice poses significant challenges for EU member states, as it undermines fair competition, distorts labor market dynamics, and erodes public finances. The European Union has implemented various legal frameworks and regulatory measures aimed at combating undeclared work, promoting transparency, and ensuring compliance with labor laws. By addressing moonlighting, the EU seeks to protect workers' rights, enhance social security contributions, and foster a level playing field for businesses, thereby reinforcing the integrity of the internal market.",
