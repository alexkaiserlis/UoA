  "summary": "The \"right to disconnect\" is a significant concept within EU labour law and labour relations, aimed at safeguarding employees' work-life balance. This right empowers workers to disengage from work-related communications outside of designated working hours, thereby promoting mental well-being and preventing burnout. The EU has recognized the necessity of this right in the context of increasing remote work and digital connectivity. Member States are encouraged to implement regulations that ensure employees can exercise this right without facing negative repercussions, thereby fostering a healthier work environment and enhancing overall productivity. This concept reflects a progressive approach to modern labour relations.",
