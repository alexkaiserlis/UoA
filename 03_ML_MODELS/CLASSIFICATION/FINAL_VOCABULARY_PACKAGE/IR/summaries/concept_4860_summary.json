  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"butter\" is categorized under processed agricultural produce, specifically focusing on milkfats. The regulation of butter involves stringent measures regarding quality, storagecost, and categorization to ensure compliance with standards across member states, including the Netherlands and Slovakia. Butter producers must adhere to specific guidelines for processing, including the use of ethylester and recombined milkproducts, to maintain product integrity. The effectiveness of these regulations is monitored through timel assessments and quality checks, ensuring that products offered in the market meet the required standards. Additionally, the regulation stipulates proper wrappings and storage conditions to prevent underuse and maintain freshness, particularly during peak periods like Sundays and the month of April.",
