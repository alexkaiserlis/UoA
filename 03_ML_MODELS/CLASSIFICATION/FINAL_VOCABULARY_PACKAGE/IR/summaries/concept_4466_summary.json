  "summary": "The concept of \"Tonga\" within the category of economic geography pertains to the archipelago located in the South Pacific, which is significant in various EU legal and regulatory frameworks. While Tonga itself is not a member of the European Union, its economic activities, particularly in trade and environmental regulations, may intersect with EU policies aimed at sustainable development and international cooperation. The EU engages with Pacific nations, including Tonga, through agreements that address economic cooperation, environmental sustainability, and cultural exchange. Understanding Tonga's economic geography is essential for EU institutions in formulating policies that promote regional stability and development.",
