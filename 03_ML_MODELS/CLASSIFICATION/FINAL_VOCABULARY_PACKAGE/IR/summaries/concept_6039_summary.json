  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"food colouring\" encompasses various substances, including natural and synthetic dyes, used to enhance the aesthetic appeal of food products. Notable examples include erythrosine and carminic acid, derived from cochineal, as well as carotenoids such as capsanthin and xanthophylls. Regulations stipulate that food colourings must be analytically verified for safety and compliance, ensuring they do not bleed or alter the food's natural shade. The use of naphthalenol and butylimidazole is regulated due to potential health impacts. Additionally, substances like chlorophyllins and annatto are employed for their synergic effects in food technology, contributing to the vibrant appearance of products like pesto and marbled cheeses.",
