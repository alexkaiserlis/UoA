  "summary": "The term \"pre-recorded cassette\" is classified under the category of communications within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, redirecting to the preferred term \"audio cassette.\" This concept is invoked in various contexts, including customs and trade regulations, where it is essential for the classification of goods. The nomenclature and statistical codes associated with audio cassettes are issued by relevant authorities and annexed to binding regulations. These codes conform to a uniform tariff system, ensuring that rights and obligations are clearly defined. The committee responsible for this classification continues to adopt additional interpretations, reflecting the evolving nature of audio goods in the market.",
