  "summary": "\"Frontier migration\" refers to the movement of individuals across borders, particularly at the external borders of the European Union. This concept is crucial in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, as it encompasses the challenges and policies related to the management of migration flows. The EU has established various legal instruments to address issues such as border control, asylum procedures, and the rights of migrants. Frontier migration is often linked to broader discussions on security, humanitarian obligations, and the integration of migrants into host societies. Effective regulation in this area is essential for balancing national interests and international responsibilities.",
