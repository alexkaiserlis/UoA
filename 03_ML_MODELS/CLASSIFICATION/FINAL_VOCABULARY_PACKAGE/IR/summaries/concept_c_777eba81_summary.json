  "summary": "The \"fiscal compact,\" officially known as the \"Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance,\" is a pivotal legal instrument within the European Union framework aimed at enhancing fiscal discipline among member states. Established in response to the Eurozone crisis, this treaty mandates strict budgetary rules, including a balanced budget requirement and a limit on structural deficits. It emphasizes the importance of coordination in economic governance to ensure stability across the EU. As a redirect, the term \"fiscal compact\" leads to the preferred term, highlighting its role in reinforcing the governance mechanisms that underpin the EU's economic and monetary union.",
