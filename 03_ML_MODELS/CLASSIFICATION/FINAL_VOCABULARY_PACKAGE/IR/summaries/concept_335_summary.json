  "summary": "The \"economic cycle\" refers to the fluctuations in economic activity over time, characterized by periods of expansion and contraction. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, understanding the economic cycle is crucial for formulating policies that address economic stability and growth. Regulatory bodies, such as the European Central Bank, monitor these cycles to implement monetary policies that mitigate the adverse effects of economic downturns. Additionally, the economic cycle informs fiscal policies aimed at promoting sustainable development and ensuring compliance with EU economic governance rules. Thus, the concept plays a vital role in shaping the EU's economic landscape and regulatory responses.",
