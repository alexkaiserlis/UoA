  "summary": "In EU regulatory frameworks, \"share capital\" refers to the capitalised funds raised by a company through the issuance of shares. This conceptually significant element plays a crucial role in the financial stability of businesses, particularly during recapitalising efforts amid economic contagion. Share capital is essential for liquidating assets and can be counterbalanced by liabilities in the computation of a firmâ€™s financial health. Regulatory bodies, such as the EBA, oversee the adequacy of share capital to withstand defaults and ensure solvency. Additionally, share capital impacts dividend distributions and the redemption of shares, influencing portfolios and counterparty risks in OTC transactions, swaps, and other financial instruments.",
