  "summary": "Sustainable forest management (SFM) is a pivotal concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks aimed at ensuring the long-term health and productivity of forest ecosystems. It encompasses practices that balance ecological, economic, and social objectives, promoting biodiversity while facilitating timber production and recreational activities. The EU Forest Strategy emphasizes SFM as essential for combating climate change, preserving natural habitats, and enhancing rural development. Regulatory instruments, such as the EU Timber Regulation, reinforce the commitment to sustainable practices by ensuring that only legally harvested timber enters the market. Thus, SFM is integral to the EU's broader environmental and sustainability goals.",
