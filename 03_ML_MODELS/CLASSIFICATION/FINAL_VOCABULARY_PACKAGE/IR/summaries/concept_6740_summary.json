  "summary": "The term \"deprived urban area\" refers to regions within the European Union that experience significant socio-economic challenges, including high unemployment rates, inadequate housing, and limited access to essential services. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these areas are often targeted for urban regeneration initiatives and funding programs aimed at promoting sustainable development and social inclusion. The EU employs various instruments, such as the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), to support investments in deprived urban areas, fostering improved infrastructure, economic opportunities, and enhanced living conditions for residents. Addressing the needs of these areas is crucial for achieving the EU's broader objectives of cohesion and territorial equity.",
