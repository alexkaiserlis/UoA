  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"scanner\" refers to automated devices deployed for screening individuals and their belongings, particularly in aviation settings such as airports. These scanners utilize electromagnetic radiation to create images for the detection of threats, ensuring the safety and dignity of passengers. Regulatory bodies, including SCENIHR, review the potential dangers associated with ionizing and non-ionizing radiation exposure, especially concerning vulnerable groups like children and workers. The harmonisation of standards across member states is crucial to safeguard citizens' rights while respecting individual privacy. Scanners must operate within limitations that prevent discrimination and ensure a balanced approach to security and personal freedoms.",
