  "summary": "The \"Arab Common Market\" refers to a regional economic integration initiative aimed at fostering trade and economic cooperation among Arab states. Established to enhance intra-regional trade, this market seeks to eliminate tariffs and non-tariff barriers, facilitating the free movement of goods, services, and capital. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the Arab Common Market serves as a counterpart to the EU's single market, highlighting the importance of regional cooperation in global trade dynamics. The EU may engage with the Arab Common Market to promote mutual economic interests and stability in the Mediterranean region, thereby reinforcing its external relations strategy.",
