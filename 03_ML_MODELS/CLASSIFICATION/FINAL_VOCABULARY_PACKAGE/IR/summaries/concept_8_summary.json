  "summary": "The concept of \"East-West trade\" refers to the economic exchanges and regulatory frameworks governing trade relations between Eastern and Western European countries, particularly in the context of the EU's international trade policies. This trade dynamic has evolved significantly since the end of the Cold War, necessitating the establishment of legal instruments that facilitate market access, harmonize standards, and promote fair competition. The EU's regulatory approach aims to enhance trade efficiency while ensuring compliance with environmental and social standards. As such, East-West trade is pivotal in shaping the EU's external trade relations and fostering economic integration across diverse markets.",
