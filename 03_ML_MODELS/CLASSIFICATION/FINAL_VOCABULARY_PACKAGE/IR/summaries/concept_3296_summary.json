  "summary": "The term \"religious sect\" refers to a distinct group within a broader religious tradition, often characterized by unique beliefs and practices that diverge from mainstream doctrines. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the recognition and treatment of religious sects can raise complex issues related to freedom of religion, cultural diversity, and human rights. The EU promotes tolerance and respect for various religious expressions, yet it also addresses potential concerns regarding the activities of sects that may infringe on individual rights or public order. Therefore, understanding the legal implications of religious sects is essential for ensuring compliance with EU regulations while safeguarding cultural and religious pluralism.",
