  "summary": "\"EU borrowing\" refers to the European Union's capacity to engage in financial borrowing, primarily to fund various projects and initiatives aimed at fostering economic stability and growth. This borrowing is subject to strict regulatory frameworks that ensure creditworthiness and repayment capabilities, thereby empowering the EU to manage its financial obligations effectively. The process involves disbursement of funds, which may be influenced by factors such as market conditions and the need for deregulation in certain sectors. As the EU navigates economic challenges, including disequilibrium and unevenly distributed resources, its borrowing strategies must accommodate diverse needs, from infrastructure to support for handicrafts and tourism. The paramount goal remains realizing sustainable growth while ensuring that borrowed funds are repayable and effectively utilized.",
