  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"stamp\" is often redirected to the preferred term \"official seal.\" An official seal serves as a crucial documentation tool, signifying authenticity and formal approval of various legal instruments, contracts, and administrative acts. It embodies the authority of the issuing body, ensuring that documents are recognized as legitimate within the EU framework. The use of an official seal is governed by specific regulations, which may vary across member states, but its fundamental purpose remains consistent: to provide a reliable means of verifying the integrity and provenance of official documentation.",
