  "summary": "The concept of \"sport\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses a wide array of activities, including competitive events held at racecourses and racetracks, such as the renowned Kentucky Derby and Melbourne Cup. The EU recognizes the importance of sportswomen and sportsmen in promoting social cohesion and physical endurance. Regulatory measures often address the pedagogical aspects of sports, ensuring that programs foster skills like fencing, where athletes, including fencers from Jiang and Husheng, can thrive. Additionally, the EU's commitment to inclusivity is reflected in initiatives that heighten participation across diverse demographics, ascertaining equitable access to facilities and resources. The legal landscape also encompasses issues related to safety, notifiability of events, and the certification of sports equipment, ensuring compliance with standards that protect participants' health and well-being.",
