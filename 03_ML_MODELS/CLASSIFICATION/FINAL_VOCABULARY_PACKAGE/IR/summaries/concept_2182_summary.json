  "summary": "The concept of \"national market organisation,\" a redirect to \"market organisation,\" plays a crucial role in the EU's trade policy framework established in 2006. This framework strives to confront longstanding challenges in harmoniously redistributing market resources among member states. By establishing specific regulations, it facilitates openings for competition, ensuring that nations can compete without jeopardizing their economic survival. The particularities of each market are valued, and the execution of these regulations is crucial for visibility and complementarity in trade relationships. Conferences and seminars are often held to address abrupt changes and aggregate insights, ensuring that stakeholders can navigate the complexities of the market landscape effectively. Henceforth, the EU aims to differentiate its approach, addressing both acute challenges and the needs of diverse sectors, such as isoglucose and starch production, while maintaining a focus on intellectual property rights and fair trade practices.",
