  "summary": "Coppiced woodland refers to a specific forestry management practice where trees are periodically cut back to ground level, promoting new growth from the stumps or roots. This sustainable method enhances biodiversity and supports ecosystem services, aligning with EU regulations aimed at sustainable forest management and conservation. The practice is recognized within the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the EU Forestry Strategy, which emphasize the importance of maintaining healthy forests. By fostering a diverse habitat, coppiced woodlands contribute to climate change mitigation efforts and the preservation of rural landscapes, making them integral to EU environmental policies and regulatory frameworks.",
