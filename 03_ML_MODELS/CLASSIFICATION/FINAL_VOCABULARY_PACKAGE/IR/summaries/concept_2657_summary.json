  "summary": "The concept of \"reference price\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to a standardized price used for various purposes, including the marketing of agricultural products and the stabilization of market conditions. This price is often derived from an arithmetic calculation based on historical data, which may include prices of specific commodities like cach, cichorium, and endivia. The reference price serves as a benchmark for commercial transactions, aiding in the realignment of market dynamics and minimizing disturbances that could destabilize sectors. For instance, in fisheries, the reference price for species such as gadus and illex is crucial for ensuring fair trading practices. Additionally, it may influence the pricing of products like tangerines and clementines, ensuring that market participants can navigate fluctuations effectively. The regulatory framework often waives certain requirements for small-scale producers, thereby facilitating their participation in the market while maintaining the integrity of the pricing system.",
