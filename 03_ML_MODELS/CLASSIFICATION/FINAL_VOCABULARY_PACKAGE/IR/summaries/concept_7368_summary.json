  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, a \"manifesto\" refers to a formal declaration of intentions, motives, or views, often articulated by political entities or organizations. It serves as a foundational document outlining policy objectives and guiding principles, thereby influencing legislative frameworks and public discourse. Within the EU, manifestos may be utilized during electoral processes or in the formulation of strategic initiatives, reflecting the aspirations of member states or political groups. The clarity and specificity of a manifesto are crucial for ensuring transparency and accountability in governance, thereby reinforcing democratic values within the Union.",
