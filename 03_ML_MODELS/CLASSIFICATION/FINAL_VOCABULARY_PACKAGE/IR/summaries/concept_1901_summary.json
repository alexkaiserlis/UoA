  "summary": "Microeconomics, a critical component of economic analysis, examines the behavior of individuals and firms in decision-making processes regarding resource allocation. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, microeconomic principles inform policies that promote competition, consumer protection, and market efficiency. The EU employs microeconomic analysis to assess the impact of regulations on market dynamics, ensuring that legislative measures foster innovation and economic growth. By understanding microeconomic factors, EU institutions can craft regulations that enhance market transparency and address market failures, ultimately contributing to a more integrated and competitive European single market.",
