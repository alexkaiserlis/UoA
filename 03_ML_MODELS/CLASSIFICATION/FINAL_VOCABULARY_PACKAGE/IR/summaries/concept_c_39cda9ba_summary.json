  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"biocide\" refers to any substance or mixture intended to destroy, deter, or control harmful organisms, including pests and pathogens, in agricultural production. Governed primarily by Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, biocides are subject to stringent evaluation and authorization processes to ensure safety for humans, animals, and the environment. The regulation delineates specific categories of biocidal products, emphasizing the need for efficacy and minimal adverse effects. Compliance with these regulations is critical for manufacturers and distributors within the EU market, ensuring that biocides contribute effectively to sustainable agricultural practices.",
