  "summary": "The \"revision of the Treaty (EU)\" refers to the constitutional process by which the European Union's foundational treaties are amended. This process is convened through meetings of the heads of state or government, who consult on proposed amendments. The Lisbon Treaty and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) outline the procedures for such revisions, requiring the consent of respective parliaments and the people. During these conferences, representatives examine concerns and intentions, ultimately deciding on the extent and terms of amendments. The conclusions of these meetings are documented, and any proposed protocols are annexed for further examination and notification.",
