  "summary": "The \"single payment scheme\" (SPS) is a pivotal component of EU agricultural policy, designed to provide direct payments to farmers, thereby decoupling income support from production levels. This regulatory framework aims to stabilize agricultural incomes, especially in regions like Alentejana, where harsh droughts and erratic rainfall can severely impact yields. By directing financial support to autochthonous breeds, such as the Mertolenga and Alentejana, the SPS encourages sustainable practices and pasturing methods. The scheme also addresses the aggravation of environmental challenges, including landslides and water shortages, while promoting the cultivation of diverse crops, like beetroot. Ultimately, the SPS manifests a supportive approach to ensure the resilience of farming communities across the EU.",
