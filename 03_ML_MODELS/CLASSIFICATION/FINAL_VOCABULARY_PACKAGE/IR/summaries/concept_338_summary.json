  "summary": "The concept of \"speaking time\" pertains to the allocation of time during \"parliamentary debate\" within the framework of EU legislative procedures. It is crucial for ensuring that all Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) can express their views on proposed legislation or policy matters in a structured manner. The regulation of speaking time is essential for maintaining order and facilitating effective discourse, allowing for a balanced representation of opinions. As a redirect to \"parliamentary debate,\" the term underscores the procedural significance of time management in legislative discussions, thereby enhancing the democratic process within the EU's institutional architecture.",
