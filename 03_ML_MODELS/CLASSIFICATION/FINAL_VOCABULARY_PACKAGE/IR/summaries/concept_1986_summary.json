  "summary": "Montserrat, an overseas territory of the United Kingdom, is categorized under EU regulations concerning overseas countries and territories (OCTs). The concept justifies the application of Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for sourcing materials, which can automatically benefit local industries. In considering the progressive development of Montserrat, the EU aims to fulfill its commitments to employment creation and economic stability. Notably, derogations may apply to sensitive sectors, allowing for flexible connections to EU markets. The statistics on trade and industry capacity highlight the territory's potential, while plans for future development are essential in addressing any shortfall in resources.",
