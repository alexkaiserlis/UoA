  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the term \"ring road\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"expressway.\" An expressway is a significant component of land transport infrastructure, designed to facilitate efficient vehicular movement around urban areas, thereby alleviating congestion on city roads. The regulatory implications of expressways include adherence to safety standards, environmental assessments, and compliance with EU transport policies aimed at promoting sustainable mobility. The designation of expressways as critical transport routes underscores their role in enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development within the EU, while also addressing regional planning and environmental concerns.",
