  "summary": "The concept of \"concentration of powers\" refers to the centralization of authority within governmental structures, which can impact the balance of power and democratic governance in the European Union. This phenomenon raises concerns regarding the potential erosion of checks and balances, leading to authoritarian tendencies. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the concentration of powers is scrutinized to ensure compliance with principles of democracy and rule of law. Regulatory measures aim to prevent excessive centralization that could undermine public safety and political accountability, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the EU's institutional architecture and promoting equitable governance across member states.",
