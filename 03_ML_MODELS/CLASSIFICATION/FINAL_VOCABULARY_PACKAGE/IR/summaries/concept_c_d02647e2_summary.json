  "summary": "The \"right to reuse information\" is a fundamental principle within EU legal frameworks, particularly under the Directive on the Reuse of Public Sector Information (PSI Directive). This right enables individuals and entities to access and repurpose publicly available data, fostering transparency and innovation. By promoting the reuse of information, the EU aims to enhance the efficiency of information processing and stimulate economic growth. The legal provisions ensure that public sector bodies facilitate access while safeguarding intellectual property rights. This concept is pivotal in the context of digital transformation, as it underpins the establishment of a data-driven economy across member states.",
