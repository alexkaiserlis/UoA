  "summary": "The concept of \"market economy\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks emphasizes the transformation and liberalization of economic structures. It addresses the need for ambitious reforms to stabilize economies, particularly in regions like Belarus, where instability has necessitated a dedicated approach to privatization and entrepreneurship. The EU supports these efforts through tools such as the IMF and ESMA, which provide assurances to stakeholders and creditors. By easing regulations and fostering harmonious relationships among managers and donors, the EU aims to accelerate economic growth and confidence. This historic shift is crucial for ensuring beneficial outcomes and addressing inflation, thereby securing a resilient economic environment.",
