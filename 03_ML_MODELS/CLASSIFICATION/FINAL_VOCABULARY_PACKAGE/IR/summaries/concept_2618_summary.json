  "summary": "The \"primacy of EU law\" is a fundamental principle within the European Union legal framework, asserting that EU law takes precedence over conflicting national laws of member states. This principle ensures uniform application and effectiveness of EU legislation, fostering legal certainty and coherence across the Union. It is pivotal in maintaining the integrity of the single market and upholding the rule of law. The concept is often referenced in EU regulatory documents and case law, particularly in rulings by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), which reinforces the necessity of prioritizing EU law in legal disputes.",
