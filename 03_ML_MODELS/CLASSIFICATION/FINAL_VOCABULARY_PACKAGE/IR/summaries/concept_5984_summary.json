  "summary": "Abstentionism, within the context of EU electoral procedures and voting, refers to the practice of refraining from participating in elections or voting processes. This phenomenon can significantly impact the legitimacy and representativeness of democratic institutions, as high rates of abstentionism may indicate voter apathy or disenchantment with the electoral system. In EU regulatory frameworks, understanding abstentionism is crucial for developing strategies to enhance voter engagement and participation. By analyzing the causes and implications of abstentionism, policymakers can implement reforms aimed at fostering a more inclusive electoral environment, thereby strengthening the democratic fabric of the European Union.",
