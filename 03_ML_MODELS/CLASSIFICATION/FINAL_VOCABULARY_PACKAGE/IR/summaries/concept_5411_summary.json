  "summary": "The \"acquis communautaire,\" also known as \"Community acquis,\" encompasses the body of EU law and regulations that member states must acknowledge and incorporate into their national legislation. This ensemble of legal frameworks governs various domains, including environmental protections for migratory species like dolphins and squid, and the operability of fishing regulations for shellfish and sardines. The acquis is conceived as a precondition for EU membership, ensuring that all states agree to uphold standards that promote the widest possible oversight and remedying of legal omissions. Extensions to the acquis may involve unanimous decisions among member states, reflecting the prestige of adhering to EU lawmaking principles.",
