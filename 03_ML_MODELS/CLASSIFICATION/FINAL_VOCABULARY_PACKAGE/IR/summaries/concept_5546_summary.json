  "summary": "Environmental cooperation within the EU framework is paramount for addressing transboundary ecological challenges. This cooperation culminated in various agreements, such as those negotiated in Wroclaw and Barcelona, focusing on the prevention of incidents involving pollutants and hydrocarbons discharged into coastal seas. The EU emphasizes stricter regulations to rectify incoherence in environmental policies, ensuring that all member states participate in sharing best practices. The overarching goal is to balance economic pursuits with the imperative of preserving the environment, particularly in the context of accidents involving ships and the carriage of dangerous substances. Regular updates and forums facilitate cooperative efforts to mitigate dangers attributed to pollution across frontiers, fostering a sustainable future for all.",
