  "summary": "The \"second ballot\" is an electoral procedure utilized in various EU member states to ensure a conclusive outcome in elections, particularly when no candidate achieves the requisite majority in the first round. This mechanism allows voters to select between the top candidates, thereby enhancing democratic legitimacy and representation. The second ballot is significant in contexts such as presidential elections and legislative assemblies, where a simple plurality may not suffice. By facilitating a more definitive choice, the second ballot contributes to the overall integrity of the electoral process, aligning with EU principles of fair representation and democratic governance.",
