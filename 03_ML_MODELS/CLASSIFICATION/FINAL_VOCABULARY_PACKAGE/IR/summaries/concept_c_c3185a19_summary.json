  "summary": "The \"freezing of assets\" refers to a legal measure employed within the EU criminal law framework to prevent the transfer or disposal of assets suspected to be linked to criminal activities. This process is crucial for ensuring that illicit gains are not dissipated before legal proceedings can determine their legitimacy. It is often initiated by judicial authorities and can be applied in cases involving money laundering, terrorism financing, or other serious offenses. The freezing of assets serves to uphold the integrity of the judicial process and facilitates the eventual recovery of funds for victims or the state.",
