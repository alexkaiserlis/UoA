  "summary": "The \"Republic of Cabo Verde,\" redirected to the preferred term \"Cabo Verde,\" is significant in EU legal and regulatory contexts, particularly concerning economic geography. As a member of the Caribcan region, Cabo Verde's economy is influenced by its artisanal fishing practices and the sourcing of pelagic species, such as mackerel and frigate fish. The country's currency, the escudo, plays a role in trade agreements, including the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) that endorses predictability in economic relations. The EU's engagement with Cabo Verde also involves readmission agreements and waivers, facilitating expeditious movement of seafarers under the STCW framework. Revitalising economic ties is essential for both parties, implying a commitment to mutual growth and cooperation, while addressing challenges hampered by external factors.",
