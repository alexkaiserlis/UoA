  "summary": "The term \"trigger price\" refers to a specific threshold price established within EU regulatory frameworks, particularly in the context of trade and market regulation. It serves as a pivotal point that, when reached or exceeded, activates predetermined regulatory measures, such as the imposition of tariffs or quotas. The concept is integral to maintaining market stability and protecting domestic industries from unfair competition. In EU legal documents, the trigger price is often linked to anti-dumping measures and safeguard actions, ensuring that market distortions are addressed promptly to uphold fair trading practices within the internal market.",
