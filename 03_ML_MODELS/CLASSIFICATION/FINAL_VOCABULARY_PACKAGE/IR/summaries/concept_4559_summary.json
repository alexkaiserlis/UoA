  "summary": "The concept of \"worker with reduced mobility,\" a redirect to \"worker with disabilities,\" is integral to EU labour market regulations aimed at ensuring equal employment opportunities. This framework encompasses comprehensive guidelines for organisations to monitor the situation of disabled individuals in the workforce. The EU has developed modules to analyse data collected from various surveys, providing a detailed specification of the challenges faced by these workers. By mainstreaming the principle of equal treatment, the EU calls for the implementation of measures that enhance the development of employment opportunities for people with disabilities. This commitment is reflected in ongoing programmes and resolutions that aim to improve their work conditions over the years.",
