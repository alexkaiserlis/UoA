  "summary": "The concept of \"hard energy\" within the EU energy policy framework refers to energy sources that are characterized by their high carbon emissions and environmental impact, such as fossil fuels. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, \"hard energy\" is often contrasted with renewable energy sources, which are promoted through various directives and regulations aimed at achieving sustainability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The EU's commitment to the Paris Agreement and its Green Deal initiatives emphasize the transition away from \"hard energy\" towards cleaner alternatives, thereby influencing legislative measures, funding allocations, and energy market reforms across member states.",
