  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the term \"space rocket\" is commonly redirected to \"launch vehicle,\" which is the preferred term for vehicles designed to transport payloads into space. The regulation of launch vehicles is critical for ensuring compliance with safety, environmental, and operational standards within the air and space transport category. The EU has established guidelines to govern the development, testing, and deployment of launch vehicles, focusing on aspects such as licensing, liability, and international cooperation. This regulatory oversight aims to promote sustainable practices and enhance the competitiveness of the European space industry in the global market.",
