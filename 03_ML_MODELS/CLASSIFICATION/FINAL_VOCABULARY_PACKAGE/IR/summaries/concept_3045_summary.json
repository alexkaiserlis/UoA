  "summary": "The concept of \"percentage of votes,\" redirected to the preferred term \"distribution of votes,\" pertains to the allocation of electoral outcomes within EU electoral procedures. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is crucial for understanding how votes are translated into representation. The distribution of votes influences the composition of legislative bodies, ensuring proportionality and fairness in democratic processes. This principle is embedded in various EU regulations governing elections, reflecting the commitment to uphold democratic values and enhance citizen participation. Accurate calculations of vote distribution are essential for maintaining the integrity of electoral systems across member states.",
