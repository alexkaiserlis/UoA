  "summary": "Conventional customs duties (CCT duties) are integral to the EU's regulatory framework, surrounding the importation of goods. These duties are applied conditionally based on the classification of products, which can lead to scenarios where goods are overdeclared or underdeclared, impacting operators’ compliance. The measures in place aim to prevent erratic pricing and ensure fair competition among member states, including Germany and others. In instances of overcharged duties, stakeholders may face financial slump, necessitating a review of their import practices. The CCT duties culminate in a multilaterally agreed framework that supports agroalimentaria sectors, ensuring the integrity of trade while addressing concerns like the uselessness of certain imports.",
