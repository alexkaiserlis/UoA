  "summary": "A \"youth detention centre\" refers to a facility designed for the confinement of minors who have committed criminal offenses. Within the context of EU criminal law, these centres aim to rehabilitate rather than merely punish young offenders, reflecting a restorative justice approach. The legal framework governing youth detention is influenced by various EU directives and regulations that emphasize the protection of minors' rights, ensuring that their treatment aligns with international standards. Such centres are intended to provide educational and therapeutic programs, fostering reintegration into society while addressing the underlying causes of delinquent behavior.",
