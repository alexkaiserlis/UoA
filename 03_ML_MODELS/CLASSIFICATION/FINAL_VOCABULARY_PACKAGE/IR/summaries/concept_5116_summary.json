  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"ministry\" refers to a governmental department headed by a minister, which operates within the executive power of a member state. Ministries are crucial in the decision-making process, particularly in approving agreements related to energy, such as those involving nuclear operations under the Euratom Treaty. The cabinet of ministers may designate representatives to sign official documents, including treaties and community decisions. For instance, the conclusion of agreements concerning peaceful nuclear energy use in Ukraine was facilitated by the council's approval in September. These ministries play a vital role in establishing the operational framework for the European Union and its communities.",
