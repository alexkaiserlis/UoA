  "summary": "The concept of \"appeals by private individuals\" within the EU legal framework pertains to the mechanisms through which citizens can contest decisions made by public authorities or judicial bodies. This process is crucial for ensuring access to justice and upholding the rule of law, allowing individuals to seek redress and challenge administrative actions that may infringe upon their rights. Appeals serve as a fundamental aspect of legal recourse, enabling private individuals to engage with the judiciary and seek remedies for perceived injustices. The effectiveness of such appeals is essential for maintaining public confidence in the legal system and ensuring accountability within governance.",
