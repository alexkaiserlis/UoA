  "summary": "The concept of \"intra-EU transport\" pertains to the organization of transport within the European Union, enshrining the principles of multimodal connectivity and efficiency. It encompasses various modes, including coaches and shuttles, facilitating the movement of tourists and goods across navigable routes. Regulatory frameworks, such as ECMT and ADR, aim to enhance ticketing systems and promote cargosharing initiatives, thereby addressing issues like underconsumption and decongestion. The EU's commitment to sustainable transport is reflected in initiatives that encourage the use of ecocards and innovative solutions for navigating congested areas. As Europeans embrace these developments, the legal landscape evolves to support seamless interlining and operational efficiency, ultimately enhancing the travel experience across member states.",
