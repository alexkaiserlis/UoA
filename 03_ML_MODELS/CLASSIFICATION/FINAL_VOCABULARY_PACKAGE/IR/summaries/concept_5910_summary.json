  "summary": "The concept of \"European legal status\" pertains to the framework governing the legal standing of individuals and entities within the EU. It reinforces the institutional dialogue among member states, guided by statutes that describe rights and obligations. This legal status is crucial for candidates seeking membership, as it impacts their job opportunities and economic performances. The convergence of macroeconomic policies, particularly in the context of ECOFIN meetings, enhances collaboration among ministers. By formulating secondary legislation, the EU aims to deliver sustainable solutions, respecting the diverse legal traditions of its members while adequately addressing inflationary pressures and other conjunctural challenges.",
