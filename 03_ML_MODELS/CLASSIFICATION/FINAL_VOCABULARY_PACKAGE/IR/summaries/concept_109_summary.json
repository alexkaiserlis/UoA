  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"freezing\" refers to the process of preserving food products, particularly animal carcases, by subjecting them to ultra-low temperatures. This method is crucial for inactivation of pathogens, such as trichinae and yeast, ensuring food safety and compliance with standards. The freezing process must be uniformly applied to maintain the suitability of various strains and breeds, including cow and horse. Regulatory measures often require the use of specialized equipment, such as thermometers and valves, to monitor temperatures effectively. Additionally, freezing can affect the lactation and milking processes, necessitating careful selection and grading of products for market. Compliance with these regulations is essential for sellers to avoid penalties, as disregarding standards can lead to the denial of appellation rights.",
