  "summary": "In the context of EU regional policy, a \"priority region\" refers to areas identified for targeted support and development due to their socio-economic challenges or specific needs. These regions are often designated to receive enhanced funding and resources under various EU programs, such as the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund. The classification as a priority region aims to promote balanced regional development, reduce disparities, and foster sustainable growth. Legal frameworks governing these regions ensure that interventions align with EU objectives, facilitating cooperation among member states to address regional inequalities effectively.",
