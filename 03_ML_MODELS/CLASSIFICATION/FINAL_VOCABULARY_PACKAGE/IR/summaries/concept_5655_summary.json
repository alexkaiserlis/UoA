  "summary": "The term \"Visegrad countries\" refers to a regional alliance comprising Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, which emerged from the historical context of Central European cooperation. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these countries often collaborate on political geography matters, influencing regional policies and integration efforts. Their collective stance can impact EU legislative processes, particularly in areas such as migration, security, and economic cooperation. The Visegrad Group serves as a platform for these nations to assert their interests within the broader EU context, fostering dialogue and negotiating positions that reflect their unique geopolitical perspectives.",
