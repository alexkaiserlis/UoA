  "summary": "Judicial reform within the EU context refers to the systematic adjustments made to enhance the independence and efficiency of legal systems across member states, notably in Romania and Bulgaria. These reforms aim to address shortcomings in judicial accountability and to combat corruption, thereby reinforcing public confidence in justice. The EU has established benchmarks for these reforms, which include the proper execution of warrants and the impartial handling of cases. Noting the imminent need for reform, member states are empowered to adjust their legal frameworks to safeguard against breaches of justice. The transposition of EU directives into national law is crucial for ensuring that commitments are adequately fulfilled, thus enhancing mutual trust and cooperation in the enforcement of legal standards.",
