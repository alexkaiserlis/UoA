  "summary": "The concept of \"protest\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to organized public demonstrations expressing dissent or advocating for political change. Protests are a manifestation of fundamental rights, specifically the right to freedom of assembly and expression, as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The regulatory context surrounding protests involves balancing public safety with the protection of civil liberties. EU member states are tasked with ensuring that their laws facilitate peaceful protests while maintaining order and preventing violence. The legal implications of protests can also intersect with issues of political accountability and social justice.",
