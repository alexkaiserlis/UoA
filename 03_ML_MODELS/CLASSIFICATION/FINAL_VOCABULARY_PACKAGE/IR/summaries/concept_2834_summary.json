  "summary": "The \"protection of minorities\" is a fundamental concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, aimed at reinforcing the inviolability of minority rights across Europe. This initiative is central to the Union's commitment to democratic values and stability, particularly in the context of regional cooperation. The Council's decisions and articles adopted in treaties emphasize the importance of promoting and developing a cohesive approach to minority issues. In accordance with the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), the EU seeks to strengthen its action through joint initiatives that address the problems faced by minorities, thereby enhancing the overall process of integration and cooperation within the community.",
