  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"lawyer\" is a professional engaged in the occupation of providing legal services, which may include advising clients on transactions, verifying compliance with regulations, and representing them in legal proceedings. Lawyers often work alongside notaries and bailiffs, ensuring that legal documents are authentic and that authorisations are properly confirmed. Their role is vital in the calculation of taxes, including VAT, and in the determination of legal rights related to land and property transactions. In Belgium, for instance, lawyers may be invited to provide advisory services on energy regulations under EURATOM. Their expertise is essential for navigating the complex legal system, ensuring that all actions are uniform and exempt from limitations where applicable.",
