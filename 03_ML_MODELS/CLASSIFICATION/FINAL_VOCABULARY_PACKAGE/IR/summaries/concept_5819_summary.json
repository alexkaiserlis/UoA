  "summary": "The concept of \"recycled product\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to goods that have been reprocessed from waste materials, thereby contributing to sustainable industrial practices. The European Union promotes the use of recycled products through various directives aimed at enhancing resource efficiency and minimizing environmental impact. Regulations such as the Circular Economy Action Plan emphasize the importance of integrating recycled materials into production processes, fostering innovation in recycling technologies, and ensuring that recycled products meet safety and quality standards. This approach not only supports environmental sustainability but also strengthens the internal market by encouraging the use of eco-friendly alternatives in industrial structures.",
