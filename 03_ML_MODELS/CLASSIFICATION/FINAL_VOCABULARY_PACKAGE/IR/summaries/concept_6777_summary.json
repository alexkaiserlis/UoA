  "summary": "Video surveillance, as classified under EU communications regulations, refers to the systematic monitoring of public and private spaces through electronic means. This practice is governed by specific rules established to protect individuals' privacy rights while balancing security needs. The interpretation of these rules is binding on authorities, which must apply them uniformly across member states. In this context, video surveillance is described in various legal documents, including annexed codes and statistical tables that provide additional information on its functioning. The nomenclature used in these regulations adds clarity to the classification of goods and services related to surveillance technologies, ensuring compliance with trade and customs laws.",
