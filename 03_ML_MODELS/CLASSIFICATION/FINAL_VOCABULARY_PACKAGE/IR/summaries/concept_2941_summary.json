  "summary": "The concept of \"appeal against Community inaction,\" also referred to as \"action for failure to act,\" pertains to legal recourse available under EU law when EU institutions neglect their obligations. This legal mechanism allows individuals or member states to challenge the inaction of the European Union, seeking judicial review from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Such actions are crucial for ensuring accountability and compliance with EU regulations, particularly when the absence of action adversely affects rights or interests. This concept underscores the importance of judicial oversight in maintaining the rule of law within the EU framework.",
