  "summary": "A \"sole proprietorship\" is a business structure characterized by the ownership and operation of a business by a single individual. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this classification is significant as it delineates the responsibilities and liabilities of the proprietor, who is personally accountable for all debts and obligations incurred by the business. Sole proprietorships benefit from simplified tax treatment and regulatory compliance, making them an attractive option for entrepreneurs. However, they lack the legal distinction between personal and business assets, which can pose risks. Understanding this concept is essential for effective business planning and compliance within the EU.",
