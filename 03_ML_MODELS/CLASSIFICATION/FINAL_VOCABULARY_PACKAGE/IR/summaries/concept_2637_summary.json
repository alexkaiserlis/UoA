  "summary": "The concept of a \"professional army\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework emphasizes a disciplined and unified military force, equipped and trained to enhance national and collective security. This apparatus serves as a foundation for peacekeeping missions, notably in regions like Somalia, where EU actors, including the navy and coastguard, engage in cooperative efforts. The EU's commitment to investing in a viable military structure is underlined by the willingness of member states to support operations, as commended by ministers and the president. Ultimately, the deployment of a professional army aims to ensure stability and security, fostering engagement and satisfaction among involved parties.",
