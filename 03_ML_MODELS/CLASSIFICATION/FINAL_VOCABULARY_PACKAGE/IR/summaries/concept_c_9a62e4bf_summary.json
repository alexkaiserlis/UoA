  "summary": "Psychological resilience refers to the capacity of individuals to adapt positively in the face of adversity, stress, or trauma. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is increasingly relevant, particularly in areas such as mental health policy, social inclusion, and human rights. The EU recognizes the importance of fostering psychological resilience among its citizens to enhance overall well-being and societal cohesion. Legal instruments may include provisions for mental health support, educational initiatives, and community programs aimed at strengthening individual and collective resilience. Such measures are essential for promoting a robust, resilient society capable of navigating challenges effectively.",
