  "summary": "The concept of \"citizenship of the Union,\" commonly referred to as \"European citizenship,\" represents a foundational element of EU law, fostering a sense of belonging among residents across member states. This citizenship complements national identities, allowing individuals to reside, vote, and participate in municipal elections, thus enhancing democratic engagement. It promotes volunteering and intergenerational learning, encouraging citizens to become active volunteers and leaders within their societies. European citizenship also addresses inequalities, fostering transnational cooperation and solidarity among diverse families and youth. By awarding rights and privileges, it aims to motivate citizens to engage politically and socially, enriching the European community.",
