  "summary": "A \"feasibility study\" in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks is a comprehensive assessment undertaken to evaluate the viability of proposed operations or missions, particularly within the realm of Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). This study is crucial for institutions to identify options and provide advice on the establishment of joint operations. It requires expertise in various fields, including military and police operations, and aims to develop practical plans that contribute to the overall objectives of the EU. The final declaration of the study is signed by relevant parties, thereby supplementing existing frameworks and ensuring that all identified contingencies are addressed.",
