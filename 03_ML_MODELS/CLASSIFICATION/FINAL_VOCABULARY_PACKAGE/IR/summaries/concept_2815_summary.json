  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"real property\" refers to immovable assets, including land and structures, which are subject to various legal stipulations. The cession of real property often involves intermediaries, such as notaries, who facilitate transactions between assignees and takers. Mortgages and rental agreements are common scenarios where debts are generated, and collateral is established. Insurers may provide indemnity for residential properties, while guarantors ensure obligations are met. Legal frameworks also address issues like hidden or undeclared interests, particularly in insolvency cases. Understanding these complexities is crucial for taxpayers and stakeholders navigating the diverse jurisdictions within the EU.",
