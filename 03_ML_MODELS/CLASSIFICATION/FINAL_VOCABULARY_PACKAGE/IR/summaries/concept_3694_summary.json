  "summary": "The concept of \"special polymer\" pertains to advanced materials characterized by unique properties and applications within the EU's regulatory framework. These polymers are subject to specific technology and technical regulations aimed at ensuring safety, environmental sustainability, and compliance with industry standards. The EU's regulatory landscape mandates rigorous testing and evaluation of special polymers to mitigate potential risks associated with their use in various sectors, including automotive, aerospace, and healthcare. As innovation in polymer technology progresses, the EU continually adapts its legal instruments to address emerging challenges and promote the responsible development of these specialized materials.",
