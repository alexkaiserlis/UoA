  "summary": "The concept of \"citizen-authority relations\" encompasses the interactions between citizens and public authorities within the European Union's legal framework. It emphasizes the importance of transparency and openness in governance, ensuring that citizens have access to information and can engage with administrative procedures. This relationship is governed by regulations that lay down rules for good practice, promoting respectful and professional behaviour among staff. The European Parliament has provided guidance on enhancing these relations, focusing on high standards of security and information access. Hereinafter, these provisions aim to foster a democratic environment where citizens' requests are fully addressed, enhancing their experience with public services.",
