  "summary": "The concept of \"library\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory documents refers to a systematic collection of resources and information that supports the documentation and dissemination of legal texts, directives, and regulations. Libraries serve as repositories for legislative materials, providing access to essential documentation for researchers, policymakers, and legal practitioners. They play a crucial role in ensuring transparency and facilitating informed decision-making within the EU framework. By curating a diverse range of legal documents, libraries enhance the accessibility of EU law, thereby promoting compliance and understanding of regulatory obligations among member states and stakeholders.",
