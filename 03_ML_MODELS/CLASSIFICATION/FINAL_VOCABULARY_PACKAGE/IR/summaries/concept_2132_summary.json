  "summary": "The concept of \"oil pipeline\" pertains to the organization of transport within the European Union's regulatory framework. Oil pipelines are critical infrastructures that facilitate the efficient movement of crude oil and refined petroleum products across member states. The EU's legal instruments, such as the Trans-European Networks (TEN-T) guidelines, establish standards for the construction and operation of these pipelines, ensuring safety, environmental protection, and energy security. Regulatory oversight is provided by agencies that monitor compliance with EU directives, promoting interoperability and reducing barriers to cross-border transport. The strategic development of oil pipelines is essential for achieving the EU's energy policy objectives.",
