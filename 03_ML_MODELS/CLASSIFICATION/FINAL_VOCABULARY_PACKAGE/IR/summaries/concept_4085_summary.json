  "summary": "Irradiation, a food technology process regulated within the EU, involves the use of ionising radiation to eliminate harmful organisms in foodstuffs, such as spices and herbs, thereby addressing issues of infestation and contamination. This method, which can replace traditional fumigants, ensures that food ingredients are adequately inspected and free from toxic residues. The EU's legal framework emphasizes the need for satisfactory supervision of irradiation facilities to mitigate shortcomings in food safety. Recommendations for the irradiation of foods, including dried vegetables and aromatic seasonings, are frequently updated to reflect scientific advancements and ensure consumer protection against harmful substances.",
