  "summary": "The concept of \"Outer London\" serves as a redirect to the preferred term \"London\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks. London, as a significant urban area, plays a crucial role in various EU policies, including regional development, transport regulation, and economic governance. While the term \"Outer London\" may refer to specific boroughs and their unique regulatory challenges, the overarching legal implications are encompassed under the broader designation of \"London.\" This relationship highlights the importance of understanding regional distinctions while navigating EU legislation that impacts urban planning, environmental regulations, and socio-economic initiatives within the capital.",
