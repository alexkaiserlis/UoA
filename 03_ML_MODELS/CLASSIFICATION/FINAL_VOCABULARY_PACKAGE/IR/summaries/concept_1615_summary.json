  "summary": "The concept of \"North America\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses crucial aspects of international relations and cooperation. It serves as a bridge for promoting educational exchanges and enhancing partnerships with industrialised nations such as the United States and Canada. The EU regularly engages in projects financed through grants aimed at training and supporting people in various sectors. These initiatives often arise from the need to address gaps in knowledge and foster continuity in collaboration. The effectiveness of these interventions is evaluated through ongoing coordination, ensuring the validity of agreements and the promotion of mutual interests, particularly in the context of external relations.",
