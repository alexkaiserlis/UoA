  "summary": "The term \"endocrine toxicant,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"endocrine disruptor,\" refers to substances that interfere with hormonal systems, potentially leading to adverse health effects and environmental deterioration. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, endocrine disruptors are subject to stringent assessment and regulation under various directives, including REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) and the Biocidal Products Regulation. The EU aims to mitigate the risks posed by these substances to human health and the environment, emphasizing the need for comprehensive risk assessment and management strategies to address their pervasive impact.",
