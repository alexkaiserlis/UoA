These forests are subject to specific legal and regulatory frameworks aimed at sustainable management and conservation. The EU promotes the sustainable use of publicly owned forests to enhance biodiversity, combat climate change, and support local economies. Regulations may dictate practices related to logging, conservation, and recreational use, ensuring that these forests serve both ecological and social functions. The management of publicly owned forests is crucial for achieving EU environmental objectives and fostering community engagement in forestry practices.",
