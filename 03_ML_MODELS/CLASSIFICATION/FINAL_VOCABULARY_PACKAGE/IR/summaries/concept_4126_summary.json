  "summary": "The \"principle of additionality\" in EU finance mandates that public funding should only be allocated to projects that would not have occurred without such support, thereby counterbalancing the risk of unprofitable investments. This principle is crucial in regions facing economic downturns, where attracting investment is vital. It ensures that funds are not merely augmenting existing resources but are instead triggering new initiatives. For instance, in coalfields, investments in retraining skilled workers can obviate the impacts of industry decline. By focusing on completeness and the recruitment of youth, the principle modifies funding strategies, ensuring that resources are effectively apportioned and invested in unprecedented projects that promote sustainable development.",
