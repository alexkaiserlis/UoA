  "summary": "The concept of \"peace\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks is intrinsically linked to international security. The EU actively promotes peace through various treaties and policies aimed at conflict prevention, crisis management, and the establishment of stability in regions affected by violence. This commitment is reflected in the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), which emphasizes diplomatic engagement and multilateral cooperation. Furthermore, the EU's role in peacekeeping missions underscores its dedication to maintaining peace and security, thereby fostering a stable environment conducive to human rights and sustainable development across member states and neighboring regions.",
