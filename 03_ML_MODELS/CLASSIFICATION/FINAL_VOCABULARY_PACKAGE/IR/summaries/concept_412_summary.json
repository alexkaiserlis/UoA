  "summary": "A \"man-made disaster\" refers to catastrophic events caused by human actions, significantly impacting the environment and populations. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such disasters, including oil tanker spills or industrial accidents, necessitate mobilising resources and solidarity among member states. The EU's interinstitutional approach allows for the creation of protocols that supplement existing regulations, ensuring effective disaster management. By drafting amendments to budgetary frameworks, the EU can extend funding ceilings for recovery efforts. This discipline is crucial in fields affected by disasters, such as those struck by earthquakes or industrial eruptions, ensuring a coordinated response that meets the needs of the affected population.",
