  "summary": "Reflation, within the context of EU economic policy, primarily refers to strategies aimed at strengthening economic dynamism following periods of deleveraging and turbulence. It involves the relaunch of economic activity through fiscal and monetary measures, anticipating shocks that may disrupt growth. Crucially, reflation seeks to mitigate disincentives for entrepreneurs and creators, enhancing worthiness in investment opportunities. This may include rescheduling maturities of debt instruments and disbursing funds to troubled sectors. The aftermath of reflationary policies often highlights inefficiencies and necessitates moderation in spending, while also addressing the glaring disparities in economic pluralism across member states.",
