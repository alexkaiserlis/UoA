  "summary": "Long-term care refers to a range of services designed to support individuals who are unable to perform essential daily activities due to chronic illness, disability, or aging. Within the EU legal and regulatory framework, long-term care is crucial for ensuring the health and well-being of vulnerable populations. The EU promotes the integration of long-term care into national health systems, emphasizing quality, accessibility, and sustainability. Regulatory measures aim to harmonize standards across member states, ensuring that individuals receive appropriate care tailored to their needs. This concept is pivotal in addressing demographic changes and enhancing the resilience of health systems across the EU.",
