  "summary": "The concept of \"regional autonomy,\" redirecting to the preferred term \"autonomy,\" pertains to the delegation of powers and responsibilities to regional authorities within the framework of EU governance. This legal construct allows regions to exercise self-governance, enabling them to make decisions on local matters while remaining under the overarching jurisdiction of EU law. Regional autonomy is crucial for enhancing democratic participation and ensuring that public services are tailored to the specific needs of diverse populations. In regulatory contexts, it fosters a balance between centralized authority and local empowerment, promoting effective governance and regional development across member states.",
