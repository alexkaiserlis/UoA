  "summary": "Discretionary power refers to the authority granted to EU institutions and bodies to make decisions based on their judgment, rather than being strictly bound by legal obligations or regulations. This concept is pivotal within the political framework of the EU, allowing for flexibility in governance and the implementation of policies. Discretionary power enables institutions to adapt to varying circumstances, ensuring that decisions can be tailored to specific contexts. However, it also raises concerns regarding accountability and transparency, as the exercise of such power must align with the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination to maintain the integrity of EU law.",
