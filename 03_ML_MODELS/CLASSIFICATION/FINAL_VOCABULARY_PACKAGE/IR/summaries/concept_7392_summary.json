  "summary": "Urban sociology, as a subfield of humanities, examines the intricate social dynamics within urban environments. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, urban sociology plays a pivotal role in informing policies related to urban development, social inclusion, and community engagement. Understanding the sociological aspects of urban life aids in the formulation of regulations that address issues such as housing, public space utilization, and social equity. By integrating urban sociology into legislative processes, EU institutions can better respond to the complexities of urbanization, ensuring that policies are not only effective but also reflective of the diverse needs of urban populations.",
