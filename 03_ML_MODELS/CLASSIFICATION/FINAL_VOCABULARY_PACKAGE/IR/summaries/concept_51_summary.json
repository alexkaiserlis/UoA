  "summary": "The concept of \"mineral compound\" pertains to substances composed of various minerals, which are essential in numerous manufacturing processes, particularly in the food and chemical industries. In the EU regulatory context, the classification and nomenclature of mineral compounds are crucial for importation and compliance with safety standards. Techniques such as electrodialysis and demineralization are employed to manipulate these compounds for specific applications, including whey processing. Regulatory frameworks require that holders of mineral compound materials provide affirmative evidence of safety and efficacy. Experts examine these compositions to ensure they meet requisite standards, thus conferring a binding character to the regulations governing their use.",
