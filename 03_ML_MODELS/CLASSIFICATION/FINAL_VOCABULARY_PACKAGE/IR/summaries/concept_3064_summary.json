  "summary": "The term \"frontier zone,\" redirected to \"frontier region,\" refers to areas that lie at the boundary of EU member states, often characterized by transboundary interactions. These regions, such as those surrounding Kaliningrad, are vital for facilitating cross-border cooperation and economic development. They may include enclaves and peripheral areas, where residents often face unique challenges, including infrastructure limitations on motorways and highways. The EU supports these regions through various programs, such as Interreg, aimed at fostering collaboration and renovation projects. By earmarking resources for these frontier regions, the EU seeks to accommodate diverse inhabitants and enhance connectivity across borders, ultimately dictating a roadmap for sustainable development.",
