  "summary": "The term \"CEFTA countries\" refers to the nations participating in the Central European Free Trade Agreement, which aims to facilitate trade and economic cooperation among its members. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, CEFTA serves as a precursor to deeper integration with the European Union, promoting economic geography that aligns with EU standards. The agreement enhances regional stability and fosters economic development by reducing trade barriers and harmonizing regulations. CEFTA countries are crucial in the EU's enlargement strategy, as they prepare for eventual accession by adopting EU-compatible legal frameworks and regulatory practices, thereby enhancing their economic geography.",
