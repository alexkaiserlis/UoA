  "summary": "The \"right to demonstrate\" is a fundamental aspect of rights and freedoms within the European Union's legal framework. It encompasses the entitlement of individuals to peacefully assemble and express their views publicly, thereby facilitating civic engagement and democratic participation. This right is protected under various EU treaties and human rights instruments, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The exercise of this right must be balanced with public order and safety considerations, ensuring that demonstrations do not infringe upon the rights of others. Consequently, the right to demonstrate is integral to upholding democratic values in the EU.",
