  "summary": "The principle of non-refoulement is a fundamental tenet in EU migration law, prohibiting the expulsion or return of individuals to countries where they face serious threats to their life or freedom. This principle is enshrined in various legal instruments, including the 1951 Refugee Convention and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It serves to safeguard asylum seekers and refugees from persecution, ensuring that their rights are upheld within the EU's regulatory framework. Non-refoulement is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the EU's asylum system and reflects the Union's commitment to human rights and international protection standards.",
