  "summary": "The term \"non-associated developing country\" refers to nations that do not have formal agreements or partnerships with the European Union (EU) under specific cooperation frameworks.

The preferred term for this concept is \"non-associated country,\" highlighting the regulatory distinction in EU legal documents.
