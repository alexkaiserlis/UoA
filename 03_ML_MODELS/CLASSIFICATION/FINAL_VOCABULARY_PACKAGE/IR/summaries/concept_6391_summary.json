  "summary": "Sedimentology, a sub-discipline within natural and applied sciences, focuses on the study of sedimentary processes and the formation of sedimentary rocks. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, sedimentology plays a crucial role in environmental assessments, particularly in relation to water quality and land use regulations. Understanding sediment transport and deposition is essential for compliance with directives such as the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. These regulations mandate the monitoring of sedimentary environments to ensure ecological integrity and sustainable resource management, thereby highlighting the importance of sedimentology in EU environmental policy and regulatory compliance.",
