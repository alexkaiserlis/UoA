  "summary": "The term \"absolute majority\" refers to a voting outcome in which a candidate or proposal receives more than half of the total votes cast, ensuring a decisive mandate. In the context of EU electoral procedures, achieving an absolute majority is crucial for the adoption of significant legislative measures and the election of key officials within EU institutions. This concept is distinct from a simple majority, where only more votes than any other option are required. The requirement for an absolute majority is often stipulated in EU treaties and regulations, emphasizing the necessity for broad consensus in decision-making processes.",
