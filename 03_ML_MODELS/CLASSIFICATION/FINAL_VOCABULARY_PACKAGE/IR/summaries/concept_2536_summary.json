  "summary": "Dry farming is a cultivation technique employed in agriculture, particularly relevant in arid and semi-arid regions of the EU. This method relies on moisture conservation in the soil, utilizing techniques that minimize water loss and enhance soil fertility without irrigation. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, dry farming practices can be significant for sustainable agriculture policies aimed at promoting environmental stewardship and resource efficiency. The European Union encourages such practices through various funding programs and directives that support innovative agricultural methods, thereby contributing to the overall goals of food security and climate resilience within the agricultural sector.",
