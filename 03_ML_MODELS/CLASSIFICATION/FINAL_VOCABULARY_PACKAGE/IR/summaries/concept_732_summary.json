  "summary": "The term \"white-collar worker\" refers to individuals engaged in professional, managerial, or administrative roles, typically characterized by office-based environments and non-manual labor. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, white-collar workers are often subject to specific labor laws that govern employment conditions, rights, and protections. These regulations aim to ensure equitable treatment, workplace safety, and fair remuneration. The classification of white-collar workers is crucial for statistical analysis of the labour market, influencing policies on employment standards, social security, and collective bargaining agreements within the EU. This concept underscores the importance of recognizing diverse occupational categories in labor legislation.",
