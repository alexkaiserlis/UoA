  "summary": "The \"dissolution of parliament\" refers to the formal termination of a parliamentary session, which can occur under various legal frameworks within EU member states. This process is often initiated by the head of state or government and can lead to new elections. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, the dissolution of parliament is significant as it can impact legislative continuity and the functioning of democratic institutions. It is a crucial mechanism for political accountability, allowing for the reconfiguration of representation in response to shifts in public sentiment or governance challenges. Understanding this concept is essential for analyzing political stability within the EU.",
