  "summary": "The concept of \"undefined citizenship\" refers to individuals who do not possess formal citizenship status but are recognized as \"recognised non-citizen\" under international law. This status is significant within EU legal frameworks, particularly concerning the rights and obligations of individuals in cross-border contexts. Recognised non-citizens may include refugees, stateless persons, or those with limited residency rights, impacting their access to social services and legal protections. The term \"undefined citizenship\" is a redirect to \"recognised non-citizen,\" highlighting the necessity for clarity in legal terminology to ensure adequate protection and recognition of rights for these individuals within EU regulations.",
