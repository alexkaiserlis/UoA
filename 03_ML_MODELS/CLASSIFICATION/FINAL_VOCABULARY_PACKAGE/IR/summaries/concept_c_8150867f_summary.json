  "summary": "The concept of \"international public procurement,\" which redirects to the \"agreement on government procurement,\" pertains to the regulatory framework governing public contracts in an international context. Within the EU legal landscape, this agreement facilitates fair competition and transparency in government procurement processes among member states and other signatories. It aims to enhance market access for suppliers, ensuring that public contracts are awarded based on merit and compliance with established standards. The EU actively promotes adherence to these principles, fostering a cohesive regulatory environment that supports international trade and economic cooperation while safeguarding public interests.",
