  "summary": "The concept of \"long-term outlook,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"long-term forecast,\" is integral to economic analysis within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. It encompasses projections that inform policymakers about future economic conditions, enabling strategic planning and decision-making. Long-term forecasts are essential for assessing the sustainability of economic policies and ensuring alignment with the EU's broader objectives, such as growth, stability, and cohesion. By providing a comprehensive view of potential economic scenarios, these forecasts facilitate informed legislative actions and regulatory measures, ultimately supporting the EU's commitment to fostering a resilient and competitive internal market.",
