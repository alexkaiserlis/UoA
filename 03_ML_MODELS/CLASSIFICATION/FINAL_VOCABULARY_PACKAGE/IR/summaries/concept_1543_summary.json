  "summary": "The term \"ordinary court of law\" refers to a fundamental component of the judicial system within the European Union's legal framework. It designates courts that handle general jurisdiction cases, as opposed to specialized or administrative courts. Ordinary courts ensure the application of law and the protection of rights, serving as the primary venue for civil and criminal matters. Their decisions are subject to appeal, thereby reinforcing the rule of law and judicial oversight. In the context of EU regulations, ordinary courts play a crucial role in interpreting and enforcing EU law, ensuring compliance with both national and supranational legal standards.",
