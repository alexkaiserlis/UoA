  "summary": "The \"European Central Bank opinion\" pertains to the ECB's role in providing candid assessments on regulatory proposals affecting the euro area. These opinions are crucial for ensuring the soundness and integrity of financial infrastructures and banks. The ECB cooperates with relevant administrations, engaging in constructive deliberations to convey pertinent messages about systemic risks and prudential measures. The president of the ECB chairs these interactions, which maintain confidentiality while fostering unity among member states. By authorising the exchange of information, the ECB seeks to preserve economic stability and fulfil its statutory mandates, thereby enhancing the supervisory framework within the European financial space.",
