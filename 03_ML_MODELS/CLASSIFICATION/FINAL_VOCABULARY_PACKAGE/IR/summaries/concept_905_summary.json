  "summary": "Eurocommunism refers to a political framework that emerged in the 1970s, characterized by a distinct approach to communism that sought to adapt Marxist principles to democratic contexts within Western Europe. This ideology emphasized the importance of pluralism, democratic governance, and social justice, diverging from traditional Soviet-style communism. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, Eurocommunism highlights the interplay between political ideologies and the regulatory frameworks that govern member states. Its influence can be observed in discussions surrounding democratic participation, social cohesion, and the integration of diverse political perspectives within the EU's legislative processes.",
