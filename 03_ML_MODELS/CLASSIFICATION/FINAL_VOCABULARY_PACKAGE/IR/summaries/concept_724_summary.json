  "summary": "Emigration, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the movement of individuals from one country to another, often for reasons related to employment or residence. This concept is crucial for understanding migration patterns and the administrative measures that govern the rights of workers and their families. The EU compiles reliable statistics on emigration to ensure a comprehensive overview of migration trends. Various sources provide definitions and categories that help define the legal status of emigrants. The relevance of these data is essential for implementing protective measures and ensuring the functioning of the internal market, as outlined in EU texts and opinions.",
