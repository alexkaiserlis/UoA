  "summary": "The concept of \"professional sportsman,\" redirected to \"professional sport,\" encompasses athletes engaged in competitions governed by specific legal frameworks within the EU. These frameworks include provisions for clubs, which must comply with community regulations, ensuring fair play and adherence to obligations. Professional athletes often forgo traditional employment benefits, with their earnings subject to unique tax treatments, such as deductible expenses related to training and competition. The EU's legal landscape also addresses issues like manipulation of competitions and the rights of athletes in events like the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Compliance with these regulations is essential for clubs and athletes alike, fostering a fair sporting environment across Europe.",
