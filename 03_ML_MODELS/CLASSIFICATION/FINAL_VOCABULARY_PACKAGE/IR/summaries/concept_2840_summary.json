  "summary": "The concept of \"restoration of the cultural heritage,\" redirected to \"heritage protection,\" encompasses the legal and regulatory frameworks within the EU aimed at safeguarding artistic treasures and variously significant sites. This includes the restoration of paintings and drawings, often executed with techniques like gouache and pastel, which necessitates a rationality in selection and attribution. The EU codifies responsibilities for member states to monitor and designate heritage objects, ensuring their return and protection from unlawful activities. Cultural traditions are respected through thresholds that define the significance of heritage works, which are often situated across borders, thus requiring expedient cooperation and licensing for effective protection.",
