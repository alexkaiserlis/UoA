  "summary": "The \"Olympic games\" concept encompasses a range of regulatory frameworks within the EU, particularly concerning the organisation of sporting competitions. The EU supports hosting cities, such as Athens and Atlanta, by facilitating travel through Schengen visa formalities for athletes and officials. The regulatory landscape includes provisions for the accreditation of participants, including those in the Paralympic and equestrian events governed by the Fédération Equestre Internationale (FEI). The EU also addresses security measures against potential terrorist attacks during these games, ensuring the safety of competitors, including uncastrated male horses in equine events. Overall, the EU envisages a comprehensive approach to managing the complexities of international sporting events, promoting cooperation and community engagement.",
