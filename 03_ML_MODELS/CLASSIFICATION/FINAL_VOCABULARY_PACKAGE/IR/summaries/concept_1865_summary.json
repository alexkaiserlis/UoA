  "summary": "The concept of \"farm household\" pertains to a demographic unit within the agricultural sector, characterized by its role in rural economies and food production. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, farm households are often the focus of policies aimed at enhancing agricultural sustainability, rural development, and social cohesion. These households are typically defined by their engagement in farming activities, which may include crop production and livestock management. Understanding the dynamics of farm households is crucial for implementing effective measures under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and ensuring compliance with EU regulations that promote agricultural viability and rural livelihoods.",
