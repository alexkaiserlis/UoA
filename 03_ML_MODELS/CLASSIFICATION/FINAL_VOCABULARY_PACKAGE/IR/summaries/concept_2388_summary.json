  "summary": "Political arbitration refers to a mechanism within the EU legal framework that facilitates the resolution of disputes arising from political agreements or conflicts. This process is characterized by its reliance on impartial adjudicators who render binding decisions, thereby ensuring compliance with political commitments among member states. Political arbitration serves as a vital tool for maintaining public safety and political stability, particularly in instances where traditional legal avenues may be inadequate. By fostering dialogue and cooperation, it enhances the effectiveness of EU governance and promotes adherence to democratic principles, ultimately contributing to the overall integrity of the Union's political landscape.",
