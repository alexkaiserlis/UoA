  "summary": "The concept of \"industrial society,\" classified under the economic structure category, is redirected to the preferred term \"industrial economy.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, an industrial economy refers to a system characterized by the production of goods and services through advanced technological processes and organized labor. This concept is pivotal in shaping policies related to economic development, sustainability, and innovation within the EU. Regulatory measures often aim to enhance competitiveness, ensure environmental protection, and promote social equity in industrial sectors. Understanding the transition from an industrial society to an industrial economy is essential for effective governance and strategic planning in the EU.",
