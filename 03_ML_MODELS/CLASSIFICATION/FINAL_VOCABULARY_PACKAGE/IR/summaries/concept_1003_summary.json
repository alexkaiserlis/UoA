  "summary": "Medium-term financing refers to financial arrangements that provide capital for a duration typically ranging from one to five years, often utilized by businesses and public entities within the EU. This type of financing is crucial for facilitating investments in infrastructure, innovation, and development projects that require substantial funding but do not necessitate long-term debt commitments. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, medium-term financing is often governed by directives and regulations that aim to ensure transparency, accountability, and compliance with financial stability principles. Such financing mechanisms are essential for fostering economic growth and supporting the EU's strategic objectives.",
