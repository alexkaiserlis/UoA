  "summary": "Freeze-drying, a sophisticated food technology, is a preservation method employed within the European Union's regulatory framework to enhance food safety and shelf-life. This process involves the sublimation of water from food products, effectively removing moisture while maintaining nutritional value and flavor. EU regulations, particularly those concerning food safety and hygiene, govern the application of freeze-drying to ensure compliance with health standards. The method is significant in the context of food processing and packaging, contributing to the sustainability of food supply chains. Regulatory oversight ensures that freeze-dried products meet the necessary quality and safety criteria for consumer protection.",
