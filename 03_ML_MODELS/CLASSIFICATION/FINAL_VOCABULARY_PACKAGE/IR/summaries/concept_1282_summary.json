  "summary": "The concept of \"political ideology\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework refers to the foundational beliefs and values that shape political systems and governance structures across member states. It encompasses a spectrum of ideologies, including liberalism, conservatism, socialism, and nationalism, which influence legislative processes and policy-making. Understanding political ideology is crucial for interpreting EU treaties, directives, and regulations, as these documents often reflect the ideological underpinnings of the political consensus among member states. Consequently, political ideology plays a significant role in shaping the EU's institutional dynamics and the implementation of its legal frameworks.",
