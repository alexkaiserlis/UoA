  "summary": "The concept of \"quality control of industrial products\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses the systematic processes designed to ensure that products meet established standards. This includes the assessment of materials, such as precast claddings and waterproofing elements, to guarantee their performance and safety. Regulatory measures often involve the denature of materials and the recruitment of uniclonal methodologies to enhance product integrity. Compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) is crucial, as it ensures that products, from floorings to rooflights, are produced consistently. The process may also involve the stripping of non-compliant items and the collating of data to monitor quality, thereby preventing downgrading of product standards.",
