  "summary": "\"White slavery,\" now more accurately termed \"trafficking in human beings,\" refers to the transnational crime of smuggling individuals, often migrants, for exploitation. This phenomenon has garnered significant attention within EU legal frameworks, particularly through the Palermo Protocol, which mandates member states to combat trafficking. Europol participates in gathering data and assisting in investigations, focusing on irregular migration and the rights of victims, especially women. Governments are advised to integrate comprehensive strategies, involving consultancies and specialists, to effectively fight this crime. The Schengen dimension further complicates the migratory landscape, necessitating a collaborative approach to ensure safety and legal compliance for all candidates involved.",
