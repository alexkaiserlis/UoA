  "summary": "The concept of \"rock slide,\" categorized under the deterioration of the environment, is a redirect to the preferred term \"landslide.\" In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, landslides are significant geological phenomena that can lead to environmental degradation, impacting ecosystems and human settlements. The EU emphasizes the need for effective risk management and mitigation strategies to address such natural hazards, particularly in the context of climate change and land use planning. Regulatory measures may include environmental assessments and land stability evaluations to prevent and respond to landslide occurrences, thereby safeguarding both the environment and public safety.",
