  "summary": "The term \"NAFTA countries\" refers to the member states of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which includes Canada, Mexico, and the United States. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, understanding NAFTA countries is essential for analyzing economic geography and trade relations. The redirect from \"North American Free Trade Agreement countries\" to \"NAFTA countries\" emphasizes the preferred terminology used in EU discussions on international trade agreements. This concept is relevant for assessing the implications of trade policies, tariffs, and economic cooperation between the EU and NAFTA countries, influencing regulatory frameworks and market access strategies.",
