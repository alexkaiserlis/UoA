  "summary": "The concept of \"lake\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to natural watercourses that are vital for environmental justice and resource management. Lakes often serve as transboundary basins, necessitating multilateral conventions to prevent pollution and promote sustainable use. Various nations participate in agreements, allowing for the rational management of these vital resources. The UNECE conventions facilitate the acceptance of shared responsibilities, ensuring that parties express consent for activities impacting these ecosystems. In this context, assessments of environmental impact are crucial, as they inform amendments to existing regulations, fostering cooperation among organizations and countries in Europe and beyond.",
