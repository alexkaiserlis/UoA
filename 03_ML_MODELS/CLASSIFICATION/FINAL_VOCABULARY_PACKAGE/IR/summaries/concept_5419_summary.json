  "summary": "The concept of \"adaptation of financial perspectives\" within EU finance refers to the gradual adjustment of budgetary frameworks to meet emerging challenges and crises, such as natural disasters or economic downturns. This process often involves mobilising appropriations to support affected regions, like Apulia or Croatia, particularly in the aftermath of events like the earthquake that struck Mount Etna. The interinstitutional calendar sets forth deadlines for submitting forecasts and endorsing appropriations, ensuring that ceilings are respected. The adaptation process is crucial for maintaining solidarity among member states, allowing for the transfer of resources to farmers and other sectors while adhering to fiscal discipline and indicative headings.",
