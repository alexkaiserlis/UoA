  "summary": "The concept of \"public goods\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to commodities and services that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning they are accessible to all individuals without diminishing their availability to others. Public goods play a crucial role in consumption patterns, as they often require state intervention to ensure equitable provision and access. This concept is integral to EU policies aimed at fostering social welfare and economic stability. The term \"public goods and services\" is a redirect to \"public goods,\" emphasizing the broader implications of these goods in regulatory contexts, including environmental protection, public health, and infrastructure development.",
