  "summary": "The \"artist's resale right\" is a legal concept within EU intellectual property law that grants artists the right to receive a percentage of the sale price when their works are resold. This right aims to ensure that creators benefit financially from the increasing value of their art over time. Enshrined in Directive 2001/84/EC, the artist's resale right applies to original works of art and is designed to promote fair remuneration for artists, thereby enhancing their economic sustainability. The right is transferable and can be enforced across EU member states, reflecting the EU's commitment to protecting cultural heritage and fostering creativity.",
