  "summary": "The concept of \"right to interfere,\" categorized under international security, is closely associated with the preferred term \"interference.\" In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept pertains to the conditions under which states or international bodies may intervene in the affairs of another state, often justified by the need to maintain peace, protect human rights, or ensure compliance with international law. Such interference must be carefully regulated to prevent abuse and uphold the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention. The EU emphasizes multilateral approaches and adherence to international norms when considering the legitimacy of any interference, ensuring that actions align with collective security interests.",
