  "summary": "Substandard housing refers to residential structures that fail to meet established safety, health, and quality standards as defined by EU regulations. This concept is crucial in the context of construction and town planning, as it encompasses issues related to inadequate living conditions, structural deficiencies, and non-compliance with building codes. The EU has implemented various directives aimed at improving housing quality and ensuring that all citizens have access to safe and adequate accommodation. Addressing substandard housing is vital for promoting social inclusion, public health, and sustainable urban development within the EU framework.",
