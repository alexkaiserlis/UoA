  "summary": "The concept of \"international settlements,\" redirected to the preferred term \"international payment,\" encompasses the legal and regulatory frameworks governing cross-border financial transactions within the EU. These frameworks facilitate the transfer of funds between entities in different jurisdictions, ensuring compliance with monetary relations and regulatory standards. International payments are crucial for trade, investment, and economic cooperation, necessitating adherence to anti-money laundering directives and consumer protection laws. The EU's regulatory bodies, including the European Central Bank, play a pivotal role in establishing guidelines that promote secure and efficient international payment systems, thereby enhancing economic stability and integration across member states.",
