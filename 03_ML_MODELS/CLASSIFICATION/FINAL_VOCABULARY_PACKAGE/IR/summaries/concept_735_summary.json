  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the term \"employer\" fundamentally refers to the persona or entity that directs and maintains a contractual relationship with employees. Employers are responsible for stipulating the terms of employment, including payment structures and job responsibilities, while ensuring compliance with applicable labour laws and treaties. In instances of insolvency, employers must navigate complex legal claims and obligations towards their employees. The approximation of employment laws across member states, such as Greece and Portugal, aims to reduce differences and promote balanced labour market structures. Employers play a pivotal role in improving domestic employment conditions and addressing geographical disparities within the EU.",
