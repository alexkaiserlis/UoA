  "summary": "The concept of \"violence\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses a multidisciplinary approach to addressing this widespread scourge. It includes various forms such as emotional, psychological, and sexual violence, targeting vulnerable groups, particularly minors and women. The EU promotes initiatives aimed at curbing violence through governmental and NGO collaboration, fostering a synergy of ideas and resources. Key documents, such as those from the Stockholm and Beijing platforms, emphasize the importance of protecting victims and their dignity while addressing the underlying motivations for violence. Efforts to combat trafficking and disseminate information about injuries and support services are crucial in this context.",
