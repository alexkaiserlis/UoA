  "summary": "\"Deposit money\" refers to funds placed into a financial institution, which are subject to specific regulatory frameworks within the EU. This concept is integral to monetary economics, influencing liquidity management and the stability of the banking sector. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, deposit money is often associated with consumer protection laws, ensuring that depositors' rights are safeguarded under directives such as the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive. The regulation of deposit money also plays a crucial role in monetary policy, impacting interest rates and economic growth across member states, thereby reinforcing the EU's financial stability objectives.",
