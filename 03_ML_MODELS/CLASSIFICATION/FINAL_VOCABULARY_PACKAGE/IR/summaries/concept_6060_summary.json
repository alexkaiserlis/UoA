  "summary": "A \"technical committee\" in the EU context refers to a specialized body established to advise on specific disciplines such as biology and economics. These committees, often composed of appointed experts, play a crucial role in the regulatory framework by providing insights and recommendations on emerging issues. Members, including alternates, may be nominated from various member states, ensuring diversity in expertise. The committees operate under mandates that may evolve, reflecting the dynamic nature of EU policies. In cases of resignation or retirement, vacant seats are filled to maintain functionality. Their contributions are vital for informed decision-making within EU institutions, impacting legislation and regulatory approaches.",
