  "summary": "The concept of \"North-South trade\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the dynamics of trade relations between Northern and Southern European countries. This trade often involves the submission of dossiers containing substances and products, such as agricultural chemicals like mesosulfuron and methyl compounds. The incorporation of these substances into the market requires a formal examination process, where applicants must satisfy specific criteria for authorisation. Rapporteurs play a critical role in forwarding recommendations and clarifying points related to the completeness of submissions. The latest conclusions from examinations indicate that active engagement in North-South trade can significantly affect economic relations, necessitating ongoing dialogue and collaboration to pursue mutual benefits.",
