  "summary": "The concept of \"small town\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to the construction and town planning category, specifically focusing on urban development in less densely populated areas. Small towns often face unique challenges regarding infrastructure, zoning regulations, and sustainable development practices. EU directives encourage member states to implement policies that promote balanced regional development, ensuring that small towns receive adequate resources for urban planning. This includes considerations for environmental impact assessments and community engagement in the planning process. Understanding the regulatory landscape surrounding small towns is essential for fostering equitable growth and preserving local heritage within the EU.",
