  "summary": "\"Selling at a loss\" refers to the practice of offering goods or services at a price lower than their cost. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this practice is often scrutinized under competition law, particularly to prevent anti-competitive behavior and protect market integrity. The European Union regulates such practices to ensure fair competition among businesses and to safeguard consumer interests. While selling at a loss can be a legitimate marketing strategy under certain conditions, it may lead to predatory pricing if it aims to eliminate competition. Thus, adherence to EU regulations is crucial for businesses engaging in this practice.",
