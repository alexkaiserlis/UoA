  "summary": "The concept of \"public order\" within the EU legal framework refers to the essential principles and norms that underpin societal stability and safety. It encompasses the regulatory measures necessary to maintain peace, prevent disorder, and protect the rights of individuals and communities. Public order is a critical consideration in various EU policies, particularly in areas such as immigration, security, and law enforcement. Member States are empowered to enact laws that safeguard public order, provided they align with EU regulations and respect fundamental rights. This balance ensures that while public safety is prioritized, individual freedoms are also upheld within the legal context.",
