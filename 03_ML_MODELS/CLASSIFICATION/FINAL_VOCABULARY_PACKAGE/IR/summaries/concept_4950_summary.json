  "summary": "The \"two-party system\" refers to a political framework characterized by the dominance of two major political parties that typically govern and influence legislative processes. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, this system can impact the formulation of policies and the representation of diverse interests. While the EU operates with multiple political parties across its member states, the two-party system can emerge in national contexts, shaping electoral outcomes and governance structures. This framework may affect the EU's regulatory landscape, as the interplay between dominant parties can influence legislative priorities and the implementation of EU directives at the national level.",
