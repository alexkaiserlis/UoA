  "summary": "In EU legal terminology, a \"petty offence\" is often redirected to the broader term \"offence,\" encompassing various minor violations that are typically prosecuted with lesser penalties. These offences, while not as severe as major crimes, can still involve significant implications, such as convictions that may affect individuals' rights. The persistence of petty offences necessitates a coalition of legal frameworks, including the involvement of agencies like Eurojust and Europol, to combat issues like trafficking and terrorism. The preamble of relevant regulations often instructs member states on the advisability of addressing these offences, ensuring a comprehensive approach to penal matters, including aiding in the prosecution of unauthorised activities.",
