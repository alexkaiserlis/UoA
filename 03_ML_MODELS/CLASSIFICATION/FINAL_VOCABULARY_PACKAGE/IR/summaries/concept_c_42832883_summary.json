  "summary": "The concept of \"cash changeover\" pertains to the transition from one currency to another within the European Union, particularly during the introduction of the euro. This process is governed by a series of legal and regulatory frameworks that ensure a smooth monetary transition for member states. The cash changeover involves the withdrawal of the previous national currency and the distribution of euro banknotes and coins, necessitating comprehensive planning and coordination among financial institutions, businesses, and governmental bodies. Effective communication and public awareness campaigns are critical to mitigate confusion and ensure compliance with EU regulations during this pivotal monetary shift.",
