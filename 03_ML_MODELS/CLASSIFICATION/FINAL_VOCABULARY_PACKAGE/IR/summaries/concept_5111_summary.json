  "summary": "The concept of \"carrying capacity\" in the context of EU transport regulation refers to the maximum load that transport vehicles, such as tankers and coasters, can safely handle. This includes considerations of cargoes like butanol, cyclohexanol, and nonane, which require precise calibration of gauges and metrological instruments to ensure compliance with safety prescriptions. The carrying capacity is crucial for organizing transport logistics, particularly in managing ratios of different substances, such as oleate and stearate, in cylindrical tanks. Outdated practices in scrapping and undoing inefficient transport methods pose worrying challenges, necessitating updated regulations to enhance operational achievements in the sector.",
