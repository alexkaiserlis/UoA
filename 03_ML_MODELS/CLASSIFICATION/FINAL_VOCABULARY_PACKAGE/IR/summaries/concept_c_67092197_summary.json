  "summary": "Natural language processing (NLP) is a critical technology in the realm of EU legal and regulatory documents, enabling the automated analysis and interpretation of vast amounts of text. By employing sophisticated algorithms, NLP facilitates the extraction of relevant information, enhances data accessibility, and supports decision-making processes within EU institutions. This technology is instrumental in ensuring compliance with EU legislation, as it aids in the identification of legal terms and concepts, thereby streamlining the review of regulatory texts. As the EU continues to embrace digital transformation, NLP will play an increasingly vital role in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of legal information processing.",
