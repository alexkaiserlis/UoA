  "summary": "Archaeology, as a discipline within the humanities, is crucial for understanding cultural heritage and historical deposits. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, archaeological research is principally governed by laws that confer protection to remains and artifacts, ensuring their preservation for educational purposes. Experts utilize various methods, such as thermoluminescence dating, to examine materials and obtain absolute ages of artifacts. The importation of archaeological items is strictly regulated to prevent illicit trade. Additionally, EU regulations require that any excavated materials be documented and reported, invoking a comprehensive approach to safeguard our terrestrial heritage while promoting responsible research and cultural appreciation.",
