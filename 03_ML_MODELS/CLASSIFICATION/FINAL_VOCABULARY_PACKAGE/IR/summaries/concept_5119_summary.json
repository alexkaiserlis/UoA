  "summary": "An \"autonomous community\" refers to a distinct administrative division within a member state of the European Union, endowed with a degree of self-governance. These communities possess executive power to legislate on various matters, including education, health, and cultural affairs, thus enabling them to address local needs effectively. The legal framework governing autonomous communities is often enshrined in national constitutions or statutes, ensuring compliance with EU regulations while preserving regional identities. This concept is crucial for understanding the distribution of power within EU member states, as it highlights the balance between central authority and regional autonomy in public service delivery.",
