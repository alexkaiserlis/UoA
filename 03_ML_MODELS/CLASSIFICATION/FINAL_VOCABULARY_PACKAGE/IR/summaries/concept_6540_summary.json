  "summary": "The concept of \"diaspora\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework refers to communities of individuals who have migrated from their homeland and maintain connections with it. This term encompasses various aspects of migration, including the socio-economic impacts of diaspora populations on both host and origin countries. The EU recognizes the importance of diasporas in fostering cultural exchange, promoting development, and enhancing transnational ties. Legal instruments may address issues such as citizenship rights, integration policies, and the facilitation of remittances, reflecting the EU's commitment to managing migration effectively while respecting the rights of diaspora communities.",
