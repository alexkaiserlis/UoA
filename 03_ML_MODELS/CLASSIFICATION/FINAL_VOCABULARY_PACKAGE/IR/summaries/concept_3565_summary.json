  "summary": "Trade union freedom is a fundamental right enshrined in EU legal frameworks, incorporating principles from international conventions such as those ratified by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC). This concept empowers workers to organise and engage in collective bargaining without interference from employers or state authorities. It is crucial for safeguarding against violations and discrimination, particularly in contexts of repression, such as in Belarus. Activists and union leaders play a vital role in advocating for these freedoms, ensuring that workers can choose their representatives and participate in elections without fear of systematic limitations or withdrawal of rights. The EU's commitment to trade union freedom is essential for the fulfilment of democratic principles and the protection of labour rights.",
