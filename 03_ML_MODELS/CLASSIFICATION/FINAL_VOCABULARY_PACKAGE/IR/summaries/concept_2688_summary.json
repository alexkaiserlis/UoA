  "summary": "The concept of \"arts\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework encompasses a kaleidoscope of cultural activities and artistic expressions. It serves as a vital instrument for fostering cooperation among regions and ensuring the continuity of cultural programming. The European Union adopts measures to support artistic activities through various financing proposals, establishing programmes that cover diverse areas of the arts. The Commission provides opinions and decisions to ensure that actions taken align with the community's cultural objectives. In this context, the need for suitable frameworks is laid down in paragraphs that detail procedures for the adoption of relevant legislation, reflecting the Union's commitment to cultural development.",
