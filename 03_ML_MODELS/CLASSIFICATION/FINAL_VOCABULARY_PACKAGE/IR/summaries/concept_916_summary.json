  "summary": "Eutrophication is a significant environmental concern within the EU regulatory framework, categorized under the deterioration of the environment. It refers to the excessive enrichment of water bodies with nutrients, primarily nitrogen and phosphorus, leading to detrimental ecological effects, such as algal blooms and oxygen depletion. The EU addresses eutrophication through various directives, including the Water Framework Directive, which aims to protect water quality and promote sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems. Regulatory measures are implemented to monitor nutrient levels and mitigate pollution sources, ensuring compliance with environmental standards and safeguarding biodiversity in affected habitats.",
