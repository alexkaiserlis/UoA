  "summary": "Poverty, as a concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, addresses the plight of underprivileged populations and the persistent phenomenon of deprivation. The EU employs various strategies to optimize responses to poverty, fostering reforms that are adaptable and responsive to the needs of affected individuals, particularly youth and the skilled workforce. Initiatives like the European Social Fund (ESF) aim to alleviate unemployment and enhance lifelong learning opportunities. The EUâ€™s commitment to tackling poverty is evident in its campaigns and pacts that allocate resources effectively, ensuring that no demographic is left behind. By exploring innovative solutions, the EU seeks to stem the breakdowns in social cohesion and promote interdependence among member states.",
