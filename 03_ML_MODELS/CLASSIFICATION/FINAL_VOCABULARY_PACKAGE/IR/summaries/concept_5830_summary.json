  "summary": "A \"confidence motion\" is a parliamentary procedure used within the European Union's legislative framework, allowing members of the European Parliament (EP) to express their support or lack thereof for a government or specific policy. This motion serves as a critical instrument for accountability, enabling the EP to assess the legitimacy of the executive's mandate. If a confidence motion is passed, it affirms the government's authority; if rejected, it may lead to the resignation of the government or trigger new elections. Thus, confidence motions play a pivotal role in maintaining democratic governance and ensuring that the executive remains responsive to the legislative body.",
