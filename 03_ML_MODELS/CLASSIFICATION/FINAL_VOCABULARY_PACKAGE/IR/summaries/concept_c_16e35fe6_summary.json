  "summary": "The term \"foster parent\" refers to individuals who provide temporary care and support for children who are unable to live with their biological families, often due to social protection issues. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, foster parenting is governed by various directives and regulations aimed at ensuring the welfare and rights of children in alternative care settings. The EU emphasizes the importance of family-based care solutions, promoting the role of foster parents in safeguarding children's best interests. This concept is integral to social protection policies, which seek to enhance the well-being of vulnerable populations across member states.",
