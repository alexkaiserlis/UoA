  "summary": "The concept of \"lead\" within the EU regulatory framework primarily pertains to its usage in various industries, including iron, steel, and other metal sectors. Lead, often found in argentiferous ores and utilized in applications such as enamels and timepieces, poses significant health risks, including potential ingestions leading to abnormalities. Regulatory measures aim to inhibit lead's use in products like defibrillators and miniaturised electronics, where alternatives such as beryllium and thermoelectric materials are encouraged. The EU's focus on minimizing lead exposure extends to environmental concerns, addressing polluted sites and promoting safer substitutes. Compliance with these regulations is essential for manufacturers to requalify their products and ensure public safety.",
