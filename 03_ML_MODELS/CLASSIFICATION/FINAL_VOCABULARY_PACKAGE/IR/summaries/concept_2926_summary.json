  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, a \"recommendation\" serves as a non-binding instrument that provides guidance to Member States or other entities. It is often employed to promote best practices or to suggest actions in areas of international affairs, reflecting the EU's strategic objectives. While recommendations do not carry legal force, they can influence policy-making and foster cooperation among Member States. By articulating shared goals, recommendations can facilitate alignment on critical issues, thereby enhancing the EU's collective response to global challenges. Their role is pivotal in shaping the regulatory landscape without imposing mandatory obligations.",
