  "summary": "\"Transport under customs control\" refers to the regulatory framework governing the movement of goods within the European Union (EU) while ensuring compliance with customs regulations. This concept is vital for maintaining the integrity of the customs union, as it allows for the monitoring and verification of goods transported across borders. Under this framework, customs authorities can impose specific requirements and procedures to prevent fraud and ensure that all applicable duties and taxes are collected. The concept is integral to the EU's transport policy, facilitating legitimate trade while safeguarding economic interests and enhancing security measures throughout the customs territory.",
