  "summary": "Coking coal, often redirected to the preferred term \"coke,\" is a crucial component within the EU coal and mining industries. It is activated in furnaces to produce coke, a hard substance essential for steel manufacturing. The emergence of coking coal markets has displayed significant anomalies, particularly in licensing and regulatory practices, where controllers must counteract inconsistencies. Notably, the serious shortage of coking coal has prompted diversification strategies among EU member states. As stakeholders cooperate to resume uninterrupted supply chains, the worth of coking coal remains high, albeit with challenges related to the mixture of quality and the impact of Chinese imports.",
