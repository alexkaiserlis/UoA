  "summary": "Nomadism, within the context of EU migration law, refers to the practice of individuals or groups moving frequently, often across borders, without a permanent residence. This phenomenon poses unique regulatory challenges, particularly in relation to the rights of nomadic populations, including access to social services, employment, and legal recognition. The EU's legal framework must address the complexities of nomadism, ensuring that such mobile communities are not marginalized and that their rights are protected under existing migration policies. Effective integration strategies are essential to accommodate the diverse needs of nomadic individuals while upholding EU principles of freedom of movement and non-discrimination.",
