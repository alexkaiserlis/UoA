  "summary": "The \"tax on capital\" refers to a fiscal measure imposed by EU member states on income generated from capital assets, such as dividends, interest, and capital gains. This taxation is crucial for ensuring equitable revenue generation within the EU's regulatory framework. It aligns with broader economic policies aimed at enhancing fiscal sustainability and addressing disparities among member states. The legal basis for such taxes is often derived from national legislation, which must comply with EU directives and regulations to avoid conflicts with the single market principles. Ultimately, the \"tax on capital\" serves as a vital tool for economic governance within the EU.",
