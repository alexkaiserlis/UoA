  "summary": "The concept of \"taxation of imports,\" redirected to the preferred term \"import tax,\" encompasses the legal framework governing the imposition of tariffs on goods entering the EU. This regulatory mechanism aims to ensure fair competition and protect domestic industries, such as those producing cassava or various breads and pastries. Import taxes may vary based on the product's origin, with provisions for countervailing duties to address unfair pricing practices. The EU's legal documents detail amendments and definitions relevant to import taxation, including the treatment of goods like husks and cordials. Compliance with these regulations is essential for businesses engaged in international conveyance and trade, ensuring they do not forgo necessary tariffs or face penalties.",
