  "summary": "The concept of \"world market situation,\" redirected to \"international market,\" encompasses the EU's regulatory framework addressing trade dynamics. This framework strives to confront longstanding challenges in global commerce, ensuring that member states can effectively assimilate international standards. The EU underwrites policies that facilitate visibility and homogeneity in trade practices, engaging stakeholders through seminars and consultations. By evaluating the market's openings, the EU executes strategies that enhance competitiveness, particularly in sectors like agriculture, where products such as chickens, turkeys, and geese are valued. The regulatory approach also includes prophylactic measures to mitigate risks, ensuring that the market remains robust and responsive to fluctuations.",
