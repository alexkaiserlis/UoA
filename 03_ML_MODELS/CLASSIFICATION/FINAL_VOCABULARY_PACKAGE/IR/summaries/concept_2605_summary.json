  "summary": "The concept of \"social-security benefit\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses various forms of support for workers, including salariati, lavoratori, and selfemployed individuals. These benefits are geared towards addressing complexities such as maternity, sickness, and invalidity, ensuring that insured workers receive adequate emoluments. The hierarchy of benefits is enshrined in EU norms, which advocate for equitable treatment of migrant workers and their families, including survivors. Employers are obligated to register employees, while waivers and appeals may arise in cases of conflicted dealings. The Tampere conclusions emphasize the importance of compiling comprehensive modules to streamline benefit access for all categories of workers, thus promoting social protection across the EU.",
