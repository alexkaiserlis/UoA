  "summary": "The concept of \"family business\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to enterprises predominantly owned and managed by family members. These businesses play a crucial role in the European economy, contributing to job creation and innovation. EU regulations recognize the unique challenges faced by family businesses, such as succession planning and governance structures, which differ from those of larger corporations. Legal instruments may provide specific support mechanisms, including tax incentives and access to financing, to promote their sustainability. Understanding the legal status and implications for family businesses is essential for policymakers to foster a conducive environment for their growth and resilience.",
