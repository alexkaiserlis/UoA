  "summary": "The \"European defence policy\" encompasses strategic frameworks and regulations guiding the EU's collective military actions and peacekeeping efforts. It involves the appointment of chiefs and commanders, such as those within the European Union Military Command (EUMC), to oversee operations in regions like Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Albania. The policy is elaborated through forums held in cities like Nice and Copenhagen, recalling the implications of NATO partnerships. Exercises and strategic direction are essential, with member states collectively ready to respond to security questions. The policy aims to enhance military readiness and cooperation, reinforcing the EU's role in global peace initiatives.",
