  "summary": "The term \"family worker\" refers to individuals who contribute to the labour market, particularly within family-run enterprises, without formal remuneration. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, family workers are significant for statistical purposes, as they supplement the economic data contained in various surveys and reports. The European Communities have laid down rules and articles that outline the rights and obligations of such workers, ensuring their contributions are recognized. These measures are adopted pursuant to the EEC regulations, providing a structured approach to labour organization. The results of these regulations are essential for understanding the dynamics of the labour market and the economic force of family enterprises across member states.",
