  "summary": "State-building refers to the process of constructing or reconstructing governmental institutions and structures in post-conflict or fragile states, often facilitated by international actors, including the European Union (EU). In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, state-building is crucial for promoting international security and stability. The EU engages in state-building initiatives through various instruments, such as the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and development aid, aimed at fostering governance, rule of law, and civil society participation. These efforts are essential for ensuring sustainable peace and preventing the resurgence of conflict, thereby enhancing regional and global security.",
