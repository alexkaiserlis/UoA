  "summary": "Occupational medicine is a specialised field focusing on the health and safety of workers within the workplace. It encompasses preventative measures against exposure to biological, chemical, and physical agents, ensuring that workers are informed about potential risks. Qualified doctors in this domain conduct ongoing assessments and apply techniques to measure workplace hygiene and health conditions. The EU regulatory framework encourages the designation of senior officials to oversee occupational health standards, ensuring that workers' rights are upheld. This consultative approach is aimed at achieving a high level of protection, with reasoned opinions and elaboration on best practices being highly welcomed amongst stakeholders.",
