  "summary": "Reshoring refers to the strategic practice of relocating business operations back to the company's country of origin, particularly within the EU context. This concept has gained prominence as EU policymakers seek to enhance economic resilience and reduce dependency on external supply chains. Legal and regulatory frameworks are increasingly being developed to incentivize reshoring, including subsidies and tax benefits for businesses that prioritize local production. The EU's focus on reshoring aims to stimulate job creation, bolster domestic industries, and ensure compliance with stringent environmental and labor standards. This initiative aligns with broader EU objectives of sustainability and economic sovereignty.",
