  "summary": "Cows milk cheese, a processed agricultural produce, encompasses a diverse range of varieties including castelmagno, camembert, and gouda, each with unique characteristics and regional significance. In the EU regulatory framework, these cheeses are subject to specific standards regarding production, labeling, and importation, ensuring quality and authenticity. For instance, cheeses like beaufort and reblochon are protected under geographical indications, which safeguard their traditional methods and emblems. Importateurs must adhere to regulations concerning portioning and packaging, particularly for portioned products. The legal definitions also extend to less common varieties such as zázrivské and strachitunt, emphasizing the rich diversity within the EU cheese landscape.",
