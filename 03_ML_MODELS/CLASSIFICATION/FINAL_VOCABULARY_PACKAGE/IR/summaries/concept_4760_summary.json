  "summary": "The \"postal vote\" refers to a voting method that allows electors to cast their ballots remotely, typically by mail, rather than attending polling stations in person. This procedure is particularly relevant in the context of EU electoral regulations, which aim to enhance voter participation and accessibility. The legal framework governing postal voting varies among Member States, with specific provisions outlined in national legislation. The adoption of postal voting can facilitate the electoral process, especially for citizens residing abroad or those unable to attend due to health or mobility issues. Consequently, it plays a crucial role in ensuring democratic participation within the EU.",
