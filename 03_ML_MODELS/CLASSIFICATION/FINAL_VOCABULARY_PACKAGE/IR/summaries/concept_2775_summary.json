  "summary": "The concept of \"protein products\" within the EU regulatory framework encompasses a variety of processed agricultural produce, particularly those that are proteinaceous in nature. These products may include hydrolysed proteins, gelatines, and substrates derived from microbial sources such as yeasts and bacteria, including Alcaligenes and Bacillus species. Regulatory measures ensure that these protein products are treated to inactivate harmful agents, including mercuric compounds and halogenated substances, thereby safeguarding public health. The community's notifiers play a crucial role in confirming compliance with safety standards. Additionally, the use of catalysts and specific substrates, such as lysine and citric acid, is regulated to ensure quality in food and tableware applications.",
