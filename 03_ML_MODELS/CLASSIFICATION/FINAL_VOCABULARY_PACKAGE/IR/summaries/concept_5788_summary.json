  "summary": "The \"common security policy,\" a redirect to the \"common foreign and security policy,\" is a pivotal element of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, aimed at fostering a unified approach to external relations and security. It encompasses strategic cooperation among member states, illustrated by initiatives like MINURCAT and the involvement of figures such as Javier Solana and Kevin Mendez. The policy addresses complex challenges, including the battle against terrorism and humanitarian crises, as seen in operations in Kinshasa and Afghanistan (AFGH). The EU's commitment to security is reflected in its collaborative efforts, with contributions from various stakeholders, including diplomats like Pekka Haavisto and Rainer Vervaeke. This policy framework is essential for maintaining stability and promoting peace in a rapidly changing global landscape.",
