  "summary": "In EU civil law, the term \"pledge\" is a redirect to \"guarantee,\" which serves as a crucial mechanism for crediting and securing obligations. This legal concept involves intermediaries who facilitate transactions, ensuring smoother processes during fluctuations in asset values. Guarantees often correlate with mortgages, where a storer may forfeit rights if stipulations are not met. The imprecision in defining terms can lead to misunderstandings, particularly in residential contexts. Transitionally, the centralization of regulations aims to protect parties involved, including insurers and operators. The legal framework also addresses issues related to perishability and repackaging of goods, ensuring compliance with EU standards.",
