  "summary": "Population ageing refers to the demographic trend of increasing proportions of elderly individuals within the EU population, significantly affecting economies and social structures. This phenomenon necessitates a harmonious adjustment of policies to address the implications for employment, healthcare, and social welfare. The EU emphasizes solidarity among generations, proposing actions that enhance the living conditions of the aged while ensuring their active participation in society. Organizations and representatives are tasked with liaising to improve the efficiency of services and resources allocated to this demographic. Consequently, constant adaptation of statutes and resolutions is vital to complement the needs of an ageing population.",
