  "summary": "The concept of \"land productivity\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses the efficient utilization of land to enhance agricultural yields, particularly in diverse climatic conditions. It recognizes the challenges faced by various communes, especially those in hilly or marshy areas, where steep slopes and poor soil quality can hinder productivity. Factors such as altitude, temperature, and seasonal variations significantly influence land characteristics, impacting inhabitants' livelihoods. The EU aims to address these issues through policies that promote sustainable farming systems, mitigate depopulation in fragmented regions, and adapt to flooding risks, thereby ensuring that agricultural practices are both environmentally and economically viable.",
