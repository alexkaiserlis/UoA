  "summary": "The concept of \"national minority\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the inviolability of minority rights, aimed at promoting stability and democratic processes across Europe. The European Union, through various treaties and decisions, reinforces the protection of national minorities as a central component of its community values. This includes initiatives aimed at developing cooperation and action plans that address the specific problems faced by these groups. The Council of Europe has adopted articles and conclusions that call for joint efforts in accordance with the CFSP, thereby strengthening the overall framework for minority rights in the region.",
