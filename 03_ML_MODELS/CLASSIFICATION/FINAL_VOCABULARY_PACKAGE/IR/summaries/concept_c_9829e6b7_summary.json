  "summary": "The concept of \"policy evaluation,\" categorized under executive power and public service, is redirected to the preferred term \"policy analysis.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, policy analysis entails a systematic assessment of the effectiveness, efficiency, and impact of public policies. This process is crucial for ensuring accountability and transparency in governance, enabling policymakers to make informed decisions based on empirical evidence. By evaluating the outcomes of various initiatives, EU institutions can refine their strategies, enhance service delivery, and align with overarching regulatory objectives, thereby fostering a more responsive and adaptive policy environment.",
