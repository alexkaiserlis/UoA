  "summary": "Outsourcing, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the practice of delegating certain business processes or functions to external entities. This concept is particularly relevant in the production sector, where companies may seek to enhance efficiency and reduce costs by transferring non-core activities. The EU regulatory landscape addresses outsourcing through various directives and regulations, ensuring compliance with standards related to data protection, labor rights, and quality control. By establishing clear guidelines, the EU aims to mitigate risks associated with outsourcing, such as dependency on third parties and potential impacts on employment within member states.",
