  "summary": "The concept of \"recording\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses the phonographic reproduction of sounds, including music and spoken word. This practice is critical for artists and licensees, as it directly impacts the distribution of their repertoire. Notably, the resurgence of digital formats, such as CDs and tapes, has prompted regulatory scrutiny over infringers and pirates who intentionally distribute pirated content. The European legal landscape, influenced by cases from jurisdictions like DÃ¼sseldorf and Midtjylland, aims to shield artists from unauthorized reshipping and retailing of their works. Regulatory bodies, such as IFPI, monitor compliance, ensuring that rights holders are not ignored in contexts of bargain deals or supplemental licenses. The inapplicability of certain exemptions, as seen in the case of schallplatten and folk songs, underscores the need for clear guidelines in this evolving domain.",
