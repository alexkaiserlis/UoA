  "summary": "The concept of \"handmade goods,\" redirected to \"craft production,\" encompasses traditional handicrafts and folklore practices within the EU's regulatory framework. This category includes items manufactured using handlooms and cottage industry techniques, which often require certification to ensure compliance with quality standards. The EU recognizes the importance of these goods, affording them special status in trade agreements, such as those with Sri Lanka and Taiwan, where quotas and guarantees are established for exported products. Craft production is vital for preserving cultural heritage while also providing economic relief to artisans. The regulation of this sector involves certifying compliance and facilitating the circulation of qualified handmade goods across member states.",
