  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"invention\" refers to a novel idea or method that is eligible for protection under intellectual property laws. The European Commission, through various regulations and directives, establishes provisions for the dissemination of information relating to inventions, ensuring that rights are reserved for inventors. This is crucial for fostering research and innovation within the community. The Council and Parliament adopt regulations that define the necessary conditions for patenting inventions, aligning with the objectives of the Treaty of the European Economic Communities (EEC). Such measures help in attaining economic growth and enhancing competitive advantages across member states.",
