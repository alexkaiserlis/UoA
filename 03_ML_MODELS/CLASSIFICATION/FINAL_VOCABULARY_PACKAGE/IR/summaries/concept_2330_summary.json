  "summary": "A \"work permit\" is a legal document that authorizes a non-EU national to engage in employment within an EU member state. It serves as a regulatory mechanism to ensure that labor market conditions are respected and that employment opportunities are prioritized for EU citizens. The issuance of work permits is governed by national laws, which must align with EU directives on immigration and labor mobility. These permits often stipulate specific conditions, such as the duration of employment and the type of work permitted, thereby facilitating the lawful integration of foreign workers into the EU labor market while maintaining compliance with broader EU employment policies.",
