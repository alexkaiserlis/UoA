  "summary": "An \"autonomist party\" refers to a political party that advocates for greater autonomy for a specific region or community within a state, often seeking to enhance self-governance while remaining part of the larger political entity. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such parties may influence regional policy-making and contribute to discussions on subsidiarity, which emphasizes decision-making at the closest level to citizens. Autonomist parties can play a significant role in shaping EU legislation, particularly in areas concerning regional development, cultural identity, and minority rights, thereby impacting the broader political landscape within the European Union.",
