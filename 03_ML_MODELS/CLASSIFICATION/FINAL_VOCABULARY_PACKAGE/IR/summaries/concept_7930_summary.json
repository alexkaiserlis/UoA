  "summary": "The \"open method of coordination\" (OMC) is a regulatory framework employed by the European Union to foster cooperation among Member States in areas where the EU lacks direct legislative authority. This method emphasizes voluntary alignment and mutual learning, allowing countries to set their own objectives while adhering to common guidelines. The OMC is particularly relevant in social policy, employment, and education, where it facilitates the exchange of best practices and benchmarks. By promoting convergence through non-binding measures, the OMC enhances policy coherence and supports the EU's broader goals of integration and cohesion among diverse national contexts.",
