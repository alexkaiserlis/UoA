  "summary": "The concept of \"fiscal governance of the European Union,\" redirected to \"economic governance (EU),\" encompasses the regulatory frameworks and legal mechanisms established to ensure sound economic management within EU member states. This governance aims to enhance fiscal discipline, promote sustainable growth, and safeguard the stability of the eurozone. It includes the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, which sets fiscal rules to prevent excessive deficits and debt levels. By fostering coordination among national fiscal policies, economic governance seeks to mitigate economic imbalances and reinforce the integrity of the internal market, thereby contributing to the overall economic resilience of the EU.",
