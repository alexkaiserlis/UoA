  "summary": "The concept of \"simple majority\" is pivotal in the context of electoral procedures and voting within the European Union's legal framework. It refers to a voting system where the option that receives more votes than any other is deemed the winner, without the necessity for an absolute majority. This mechanism is frequently employed in various EU institutions, including the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, to facilitate decision-making processes. The simple majority is essential for ensuring efficient governance and reflects the democratic principle of majority rule, thereby enabling swift legislative action while balancing diverse member state interests.",
