In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, disruptive technologies pose unique challenges and opportunities for research and intellectual property rights. The EU seeks to balance the promotion of innovation with the protection of intellectual property, ensuring that disruptive technologies are developed responsibly and ethically. Regulatory bodies may implement guidelines to address the implications of these technologies on competition, consumer rights, and data protection, fostering an environment conducive to sustainable growth and technological advancement.",
