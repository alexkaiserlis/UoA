  "summary": "The \"harmonisation of prices\" refers to the EU's regulatory efforts to standardize pricing methodologies across member states, ensuring comparability and conformance in economic indicators. This process involves the compilation of various indices, such as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) and the Consumer Price Indices (CPIs), which utilize methodologies like the Laspeyres and COICOP classifications. By employing consistent weightings and seasonal adjustments, the EU aims to reduce variability in price data, thereby enhancing the reliability of economic comparisons. The harmonisation process also considers households' choices and the impact of substitutes, ensuring that prices reflect honest market conditions across residences and sectors, including healthcare and insurances.",
