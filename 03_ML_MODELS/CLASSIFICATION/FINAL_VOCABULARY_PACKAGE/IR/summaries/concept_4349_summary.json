  "summary": "The \"suspension of sentence\" is a legal concept within EU criminal law, denoting a judicial decision to temporarily halt the enforcement of a criminal sentence. This measure allows the convicted individual to remain free while fulfilling certain conditions, such as probation or community service. The suspension aims to facilitate rehabilitation and reintegration into society, reflecting the EU's commitment to restorative justice principles. It is crucial for legal practitioners to understand the procedural requirements and implications of this concept, as it can significantly affect the rights of the accused and the overall administration of justice within member states.",
