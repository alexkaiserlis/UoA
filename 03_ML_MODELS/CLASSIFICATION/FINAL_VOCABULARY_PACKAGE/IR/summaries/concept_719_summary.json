  "summary": "Emancipation, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the process through which individuals, particularly minors, gain legal independence from parental authority or guardianship. This concept is crucial in family law, as it delineates the transition to adulthood, granting individuals the capacity to make autonomous decisions regarding their personal and legal affairs. Emancipation can have significant implications for various legal rights, including the ability to enter contracts, pursue education, or seek employment without parental consent. The EU recognizes the importance of this legal status in promoting individual autonomy and protecting the rights of young persons across member states.",
