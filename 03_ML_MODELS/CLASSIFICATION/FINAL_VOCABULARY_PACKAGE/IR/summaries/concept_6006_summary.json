  "summary": "The \"allocation clause\" is a legal provision within the context of electoral procedure and voting in the European Union. It delineates the distribution of seats or votes among candidates or parties, ensuring a fair representation in legislative bodies. This clause is pivotal in maintaining the integrity of electoral processes, as it establishes the criteria for how votes are translated into seats, thereby influencing the overall composition of governing institutions. The allocation clause is particularly significant in proportional representation systems, where it aims to reflect the electorate's preferences accurately, promoting democratic legitimacy and accountability in EU governance.",
