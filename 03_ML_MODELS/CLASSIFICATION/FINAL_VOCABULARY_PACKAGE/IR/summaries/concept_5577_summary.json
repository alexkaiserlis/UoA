  "summary": "The \"budget of the Community institutions,\" redirected to \"administrative expenditure (EU),\" encompasses the financial framework governing the revenues and expenditures of EU bodies. This budget is dedicated to various organisational branches, facilitating the mobilisation of resources for initiatives such as civilian peacekeeping in regions like Darfur and Sudan. It involves a timeframe for expenditures, ensuring that funds are efficiently allocated and reassessed to meet evolving needs. The budget also supports the recruitment of personnel and the consolidation of resources, rendering the EU capable of addressing challenges like globalisation and avian influenza. Through this framework, the EU aims to broaden its impact while maintaining identifiable accountability and transparency in financial management.",
