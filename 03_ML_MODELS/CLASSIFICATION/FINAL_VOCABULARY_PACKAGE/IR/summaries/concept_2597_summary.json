  "summary": "The concept of \"rehabilitation\" in EU criminal law is primarily understood as the \"barring of penalties by limitation.\" This legal mechanism allows individuals who have served their sentences to have their criminal records expunged after a specified period, thus facilitating reintegration into society. The barring of penalties serves to promote social reintegration and reduce recidivism by acknowledging that individuals can rehabilitate and contribute positively post-conviction. In EU regulatory frameworks, this concept underscores the importance of balancing justice with the rights of individuals, ensuring that past offenses do not perpetually hinder personal and professional opportunities.",
