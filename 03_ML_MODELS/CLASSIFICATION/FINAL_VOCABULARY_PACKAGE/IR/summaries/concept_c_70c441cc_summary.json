  "summary": "The term \"transposition deficit\" refers to the gap that arises when EU Member States fail to implement European Union directives into national law within the stipulated timeframes. This deficit can hinder the effectiveness of EU legislation, as it reflects a lack of compliance with the obligations imposed by EU law. The transposition process is crucial for ensuring that EU regulations achieve their intended legal and regulatory objectives across all Member States. Persistent transposition deficits may lead to infringement proceedings initiated by the European Commission, thereby emphasizing the importance of timely and accurate implementation of EU directives to uphold the rule of law within the Union.",
