  "summary": "The concept of \"racial conflict\" pertains to tensions and disputes arising from racial or ethnic differences, which can significantly impact the exercise of rights and freedoms within the European Union. EU legal frameworks, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights and anti-discrimination directives, aim to mitigate racial conflict by promoting equality and protecting individuals from discrimination based on race or ethnicity. The EU actively engages in policies and initiatives to foster social cohesion and prevent racial tensions, recognizing that such conflicts undermine the principles of democracy and human dignity. Addressing racial conflict is essential for ensuring a harmonious and inclusive society across member states.",
