  "summary": "The concept of \"water quality monitoring\" is integral to the EU's environmental policy framework, specifically under the broader category of \"water quality.\" This regulatory mechanism ensures compliance with directives aimed at safeguarding aquatic ecosystems and public health. Through systematic assessment and surveillance of water bodies, the EU establishes standards to mitigate pollution and promote sustainable water management. The monitoring processes are crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of legislative measures, such as the Water Framework Directive, which mandates member states to achieve good water status. Thus, \"water quality monitoring\" serves as a vital tool for enforcing environmental regulations and protecting water resources across the EU.",
