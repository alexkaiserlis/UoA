This legal remedy is grounded in Article 263 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), allowing applicants to contest decisions that they believe violate EU law. The proceedings aim to ensure judicial oversight and uphold the rule of law within the EU, reinforcing the principles of accountability and transparency in regulatory actions.",
