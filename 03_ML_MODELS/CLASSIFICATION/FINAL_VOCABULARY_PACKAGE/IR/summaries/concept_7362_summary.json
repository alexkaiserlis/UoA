  "summary": "The concept of \"world history\" encompasses the comprehensive study of human societies and their evolution across time, which is crucial for understanding the cultural and legal frameworks that shape contemporary European Union policies. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, world history provides essential insights into the historical precedents that influence current legislative practices and international relations. This understanding aids in the formulation of regulations that respect diverse cultural heritages and promote social cohesion. By examining historical contexts, EU institutions can better navigate complex legal landscapes and foster cooperation among member states, ensuring that policies are informed by a rich tapestry of human experience.",
