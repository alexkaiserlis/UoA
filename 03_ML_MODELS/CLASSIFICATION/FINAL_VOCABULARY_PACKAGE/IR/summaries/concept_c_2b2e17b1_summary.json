  "summary": "The term \"EU candidate countries\" refers to nations that aspire to join the European Union and are undergoing the accession process. This process involves rigorous adherence to the EU's legal and regulatory frameworks, including the Copenhagen criteria, which mandate stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and a functioning market economy. Candidate countries must align their national legislation with EU acquis communautaire, ensuring compliance with economic and social standards. The accession process is a complex interplay of negotiations, reforms, and evaluations, ultimately aimed at fostering integration and enhancing economic geography within the EU's internal market.",
