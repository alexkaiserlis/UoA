  "summary": "\"Structural fluctuation\" refers to significant and often persistent changes in the economic conditions of a region or sector within the EU. These fluctuations can arise from various factors, including shifts in market demand, regulatory adjustments, or external economic shocks. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, understanding structural fluctuation is crucial for policymakers and regulators to devise appropriate interventions and support mechanisms. By analyzing these fluctuations, the EU can better anticipate economic trends, implement effective fiscal policies, and ensure stability across member states. This concept is integral to assessing economic resilience and formulating strategies that address long-term structural challenges.",
