  "summary": "Family migration refers to the legal processes and regulations governing the movement of family members across borders within the European Union. This concept encompasses various aspects of EU law, including the right to family reunification, which allows non-EU nationals to join their family members who are legally residing in an EU Member State. The EU's legal framework aims to facilitate family unity while ensuring compliance with immigration policies. Family migration is integral to the broader migration category, addressing the social and humanitarian dimensions of migration, thus reinforcing the EU's commitment to human rights and social cohesion among its diverse populations.",
