  "summary": "European private law encompasses the legal frameworks governing private relationships and transactions within the European Union. It aims to harmonize national laws to facilitate cross-border interactions, ensuring consistency in areas such as contract law, tort law, and family law. This branch of law is pivotal for fostering legal certainty and protecting individual rights across member states. The EU has initiated various directives and regulations to streamline private law, enhancing cooperation among national legal systems. As a result, European private law not only promotes economic integration but also safeguards the principles of justice and equity within the internal market.",
