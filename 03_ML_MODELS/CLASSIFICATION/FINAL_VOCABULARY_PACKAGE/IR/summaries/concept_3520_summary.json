  "summary": "Job sharing is a flexible employment arrangement where two or more employees share the responsibilities and duties of a single full-time position. This concept is increasingly recognized within EU legal and regulatory frameworks as a means to promote work-life balance and enhance job accessibility. By facilitating part-time work, job sharing can contribute to gender equality in the labor market and support the integration of diverse workforce demographics. The EU encourages member states to adopt policies that foster job sharing, thereby enhancing employment opportunities and reducing unemployment rates, particularly among underrepresented groups.",
