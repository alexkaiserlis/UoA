  "summary": "Protestant church law refers to the body of legal principles governing the organization, administration, and practices of Protestant churches within the context of EU legal frameworks. This area of law encompasses ecclesiastical regulations, the rights of religious communities, and the interaction between state and church, particularly in member states with established Protestant traditions. It plays a crucial role in ensuring the autonomy of religious institutions while also adhering to broader EU principles of religious freedom and non-discrimination. Understanding Protestant church law is essential for navigating the complex interplay of national laws and EU regulations affecting religious entities.",
