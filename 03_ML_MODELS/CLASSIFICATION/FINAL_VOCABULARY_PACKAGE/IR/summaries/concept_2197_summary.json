  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the term \"orphan\" typically refers to orphan medicinal products, which are drugs developed for the treatment of rare diseases affecting fewer than 5 in 10,000 individuals in the European Union. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) promotes the development of these products through incentives such as market exclusivity and financial support. This regulatory approach aims to address the unmet medical needs of patients with rare conditions, ensuring that pharmaceutical innovation is not solely driven by commercial viability. The orphan designation facilitates access to essential therapies, thereby enhancing public health outcomes across the EU.",
