  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"commodity price\" refers to the monetary value assigned to raw materials and primary goods traded in markets. These prices are critical for establishing market stability and ensuring fair competition within the internal market. Regulatory bodies, such as the European Commission, monitor commodity prices to prevent market distortions and protect consumers. Fluctuations in commodity prices can significantly impact economic policies, trade agreements, and agricultural regulations. Understanding commodity prices is essential for compliance with EU legislation, particularly in sectors reliant on raw materials, ensuring transparency and accountability in market operations.",
