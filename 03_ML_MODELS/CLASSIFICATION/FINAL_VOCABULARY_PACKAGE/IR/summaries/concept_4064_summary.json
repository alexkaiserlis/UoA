  "summary": "The concept \"SELA,\" which redirects to the \"Latin American Economic System,\" pertains to an intergovernmental organization aimed at fostering economic integration and cooperation among Latin American countries. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, SELA serves as a significant partner for dialogue and collaboration on trade, investment, and development issues. The EU engages with SELA to enhance bilateral relations and promote sustainable economic growth in the region. This relationship is crucial for aligning regulatory standards and facilitating market access, thereby reinforcing the EU's strategic interests in extra-European organisations and international economic governance.",
