  "summary": "The concept of \"protection of human rights,\" redirected to the preferred term \"human rights,\" encompasses the EU's commitment to uphold fundamental freedoms and safeguard individuals against persecution and repression. This includes addressing issues such as the forcible displacement of populations and the crackdown on protests, as seen in various contexts like the protests against Bashar al-Assad's regime or the defiant actions of Togolese citizens against intimidation. The indivisibility of rights is crucial, as highlighted by the EU's engagement with factions in regions experiencing uprisings, such as in Maputo or during the murambatsvina crisis. Legal frameworks aim to prevent misappropriation of power and ensure accountability, reinforcing the EU's role in global human rights advocacy.",
