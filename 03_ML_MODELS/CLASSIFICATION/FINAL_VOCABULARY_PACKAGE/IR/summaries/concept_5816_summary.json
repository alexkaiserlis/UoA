  "summary": "The \"conciliation procedure,\" integral to the ordinary legislative procedure in the EU, serves as a mechanism for resolving disputes between the European Parliament and the Council. When disagreements arise, conciliators, led by a chairman, facilitate discussions to achieve a finalized agreement. This process aims to clear up any unreasonable distinctions and corrections in proposed legislation, ensuring that all parties' wishes are considered. If successful, the agreement is ratified and deposited with the relevant authorities, becoming part of EU law. Delays or irregularities in this procedure may lead to audits or investigations, emphasizing the importance of compliance and ownership in legislative processes.",
