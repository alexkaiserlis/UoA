  "summary": "The \"weekly rest period\" is a fundamental concept within EU labor law, specifically addressing the organization of work and working conditions. It mandates that workers are entitled to a minimum uninterrupted rest period of at least 24 hours each week, in addition to their daily rest periods. This regulation aims to safeguard workers' health and well-being, ensuring they are not subjected to excessive working hours. The provision is outlined in the EU Working Time Directive, which establishes standards for working time, rest periods, and overall labor conditions across Member States, promoting fair treatment and enhancing work-life balance.",
