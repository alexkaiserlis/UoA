  "summary": "The concept of \"mass communications\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the dissemination of information to large audiences through various media channels. This includes traditional outlets such as television and radio, as well as digital platforms. The EU regulates mass communications to ensure compliance with principles of freedom of expression, media pluralism, and consumer protection. Key directives, such as the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD), establish standards for content, advertising, and accessibility. The regulatory landscape aims to foster a diverse media environment while safeguarding public interest, reflecting the EU's commitment to democratic values and informed citizenship.",
