  "summary": "An \"intergovernmental legal instrument\" refers to a legal framework established through agreements between EU member states, rather than through EU institutions. These instruments facilitate cooperation on specific issues, allowing states to harmonize policies while retaining sovereignty. Unlike EU regulations or directives, intergovernmental legal instruments often address areas such as security, defense, or foreign policy, where member states prefer to maintain control. They are crucial for fostering collaboration in domains that require flexibility and consensus among nations. Such instruments exemplify the balance between national interests and collective European objectives, reflecting the dynamic nature of EU governance.",
