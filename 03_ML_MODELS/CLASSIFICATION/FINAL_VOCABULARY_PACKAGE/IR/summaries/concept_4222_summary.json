  "summary": "The concept of \"source of law\" refers to the origins from which legal norms derive their authority within the European Union's legal framework. It encompasses various forms, including treaties, regulations, directives, and case law, which collectively establish the legal order governing EU member states. The sources of law are pivotal in ensuring uniformity and coherence in the application of EU legislation. They guide judicial interpretation and enforcement, thus playing a crucial role in the regulatory landscape. Understanding these sources is essential for legal practitioners and policymakers to navigate the complexities of EU law effectively.",
