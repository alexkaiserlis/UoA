  "summary": "In EU regulatory contexts, a \"substitute product\" refers to an alternative item that can replace another in industrial applications, particularly when the original product is deemed ineffective or non-compliant with standards. This concept has crystallized within frameworks addressing environmental and safety regulations, where the need for sustainable alternatives has quadrupled. For instance, in the abrasives industry, products made from corundum or smelted materials may be evaluated against substitutes from regions like Zhengzhou or Guangzhou. Regulatory bodies, including CEfic, emphasize standardising these substitutes to avoid discrediting the market. Thus, the idea of substitutability requires careful consideration of compliance and market dynamics, ensuring that any substitute does not violate existing regulations while providing viable solutions.",
