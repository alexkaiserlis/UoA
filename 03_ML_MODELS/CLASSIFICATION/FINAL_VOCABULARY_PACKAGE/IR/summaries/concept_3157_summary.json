In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, defoliation is recognized as a significant factor contributing to the deterioration of the environment. The European Union has established various directives and regulations aimed at mitigating environmental degradation, thereby addressing the causes and consequences of defoliation. These measures include promoting sustainable land use practices and enhancing biodiversity, which are essential for maintaining ecological balance and preventing further deterioration of natural habitats.",
