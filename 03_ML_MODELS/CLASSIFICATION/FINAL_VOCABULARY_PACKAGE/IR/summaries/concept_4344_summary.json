  "summary": "A \"monetary agreement\" within the EU legal framework refers to a formal arrangement concerning the issuance, valuation, and circulation of currency, including coins and banknotes. Such agreements often involve member states, like Monaco and Andorra, and address issues like counterfeiting and the authentication of minted tokens. They ensure the systemic integrity of monetary systems, preventing laundering and forgery. The agreements may also involve the initialling of treaties that establish denominated currencies, such as the euro, and set forth prudential regulations for financial institutions. This collective approach enhances the fitness of monetary policies across the EU, fostering a serene economic environment.",
