  "summary": "The concept of \"energy conversion\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to the processes by which energy is transformed from one form to another, such as from fossil fuels to electricity or renewable sources. This transformation is critical for achieving the EU's energy policy objectives, which emphasize sustainability, efficiency, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Legal instruments, such as directives and regulations, govern energy conversion technologies and practices, ensuring compliance with environmental standards. The EU aims to facilitate a transition towards a low-carbon economy, enhancing energy security and promoting innovation in energy conversion methods across member states.",
