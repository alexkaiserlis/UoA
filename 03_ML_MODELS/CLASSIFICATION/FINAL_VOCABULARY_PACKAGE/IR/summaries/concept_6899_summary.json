  "summary": "A \"periodic penalty payment\" is a legal mechanism in EU law, designed to enforce compliance with court orders or regulatory decisions. When a respondent fails to adhere to such obligations, courts may impose fines that are periodically assessed, thereby safeguarding the interests of complainants and ensuring that unlawful actions are addressed. This mechanism serves to discourage non-compliance by binding addressees to their duties. The initiator of the enforcement motion must substantiate the need for penalties, which are intended to be proportionate and not burdensome. Courts may also reject claims if doubts arise regarding the necessity or legality of the demands, ensuring that the process remains fair and transparent.",
