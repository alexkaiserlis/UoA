  "summary": "The concept of \"trafficking in works of art,\" redirected to the preferred term \"art trade,\" encompasses the illegal exchange and distribution of cultural property within the EU. This practice poses significant challenges to cultural heritage protection and raises concerns regarding provenance and authenticity. EU legal frameworks, such as the Directive on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State, aim to combat illicit art trade. Regulatory measures are essential to safeguard cultural assets, promote ethical art transactions, and enhance cooperation among Member States to prevent trafficking and ensure the preservation of artistic heritage.",
