  "summary": "The term \"unintentional offence,\" redirected to \"unintentional crime,\" pertains to acts that result in harm or violation of law without the perpetrator's intent to commit such an act. In the context of EU criminal law, this concept encompasses various legal frameworks addressing negligence and recklessness, where the offender's lack of intent differentiates these crimes from intentional offences. The EU regulatory landscape often considers unintentional crimes in the formulation of directives and regulations aimed at harmonizing member states' legal responses to such offences, ensuring a consistent approach to accountability and justice across jurisdictions.",
