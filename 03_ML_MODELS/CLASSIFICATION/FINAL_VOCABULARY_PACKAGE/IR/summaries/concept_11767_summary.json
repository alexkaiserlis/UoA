  "summary": "The concept of \"digital detox\" refers to the intentional reduction or elimination of digital device usage to improve mental well-being and social interactions. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept intersects with discussions on technology and public health. As the EU addresses the implications of pervasive digital technology, initiatives promoting digital detox may influence regulations aimed at safeguarding mental health and enhancing quality of life. Such measures could include guidelines for responsible technology use, particularly in educational and workplace environments, thereby fostering a balanced approach to digital engagement and mitigating potential adverse effects on individuals and society.",
