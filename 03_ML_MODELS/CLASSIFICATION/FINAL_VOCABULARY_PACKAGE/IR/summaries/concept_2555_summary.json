  "summary": "The term \"non-working population\" refers to individuals within the EU who are not engaged in the labour market, which includes those who are unemployed, retired, or otherwise not participating in employment. This concept is pivotal in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly in the context of social policy and economic analysis. Understanding the non-working population aids in the formulation of labour market strategies and social inclusion initiatives. It also informs the assessment of economic performance and the effectiveness of employment policies, ensuring that measures are tailored to address the needs of various demographic groups within the EU.",
