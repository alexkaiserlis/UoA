  "summary": "Industrial counterfeiting refers to the illicit production and distribution of counterfeit goods, which misleads consumers and undermines legitimate businesses. In the EU, this alarming practice encompasses various sectors, including pharmaceuticals and luxury items, where counterfeit products, such as condoms and branded chips, are prevalent. Regulatory frameworks aim to sustain vigilance against such activities, involving cooperation among national competent authorities (NCAs) and the European Commission. Measures include reimposing penalties for offenders and archiving data on counterfeit incidents. The EU emphasizes the need for recognizable labeling and the use of technologies to combat counterfeiting, ensuring that consumers are not deprived of authentic products.",
