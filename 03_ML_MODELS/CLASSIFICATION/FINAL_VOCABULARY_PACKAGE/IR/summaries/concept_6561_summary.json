  "summary": "The concept of \"new religion\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to the emergence and recognition of contemporary belief systems that diverge from traditional religious structures. This classification is significant in discussions surrounding cultural rights, freedom of religion, and the legal status of various faiths. The EU promotes pluralism and tolerance, necessitating an understanding of how new religions fit within existing legal paradigms. Regulatory documents often address issues such as the protection of religious minorities, the establishment of places of worship, and the implications for social cohesion and public policy. The evolving nature of belief systems necessitates ongoing dialogue and legal adaptation.",
