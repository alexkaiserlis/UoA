  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"resolution\" refers to a formal decision or declaration made by the European Union institutions, often in response to international affairs. It encompasses the processes through which the EU articulates its stance on global issues, including conflict resolution, humanitarian aid, and diplomatic relations. Resolutions may influence legislative measures and guide member states' actions in international contexts. They serve as instruments for the EU to express collective positions, promote stability, and ensure compliance with international law, thereby reinforcing the EU's role as a significant actor in global governance and diplomacy.",
