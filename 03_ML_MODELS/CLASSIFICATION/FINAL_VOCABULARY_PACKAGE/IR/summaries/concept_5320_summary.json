  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"waveband\" refers to specific frequency ranges allocated for various radiocommunication services, including PMR (Private Mobile Radio) and BWA (Broadband Wireless Access). The regulatory landscape, shaped by bodies like the RSPG (Radio Spectrum Policy Group) and WRC (World Radiocommunication Conference), ensures that these wavebands are used efficiently and permissively. The evolution of digitalisation has led to the emergence of new applications, such as RFIDs and terrestrial communications, necessitating careful management of interleaved frequencies. Additionally, wavebands support diverse uses, from theatrical microphones to spacecraft communications, highlighting their importance in both massmarket and nomadic applications.",
