  "summary": "A \"financial agreement\" within the EU legal framework refers to a binding contract that governs monetary relations, particularly concerning loans and repayments. Such agreements may involve sovereign states, like Montenegro and Serbia, often stemming from historical contexts, such as the division of Yugoslavia. These agreements typically outline the servicing of debt, including instalments and disbursement schedules, ensuring liabilities are proportionately attributed to successor states. They may also include provisions for discharging obligations via constitutional mechanisms, thereby strengthening bilateral relations. The financial agreement serves as a crucial tool for managing assets and liabilities, thereby enhancing macroeconomic stability and supporting independence through structured repayments.",
