  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"invasive species\" refers to non-native organisms that disrupt local ecosystems, threatening biodiversity and natural habitats. The EU has established comprehensive legislation, notably the Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014 on invasive alien species, which aims to prevent their introduction and spread. This regulation mandates member states to implement measures for early detection, rapid response, and management of invasive species. By prioritizing the protection of the natural environment, the EU seeks to mitigate ecological harm and promote sustainable biodiversity, ensuring the resilience of ecosystems against these detrimental organisms.",
