  "summary": "The concept of \"political majority\" is pivotal in the context of EU governance and legislative processes. It refers to the requisite number of votes or support needed within a legislative body, such as the European Parliament or the Council of the European Union, to pass legislation or make binding decisions. A political majority can influence the adoption of policies, the allocation of resources, and the establishment of regulatory frameworks. Understanding this concept is essential for comprehending how decisions are made within the EU, as it reflects the balance of power among member states and political groups, ultimately shaping the legislative landscape and public safety measures.",
