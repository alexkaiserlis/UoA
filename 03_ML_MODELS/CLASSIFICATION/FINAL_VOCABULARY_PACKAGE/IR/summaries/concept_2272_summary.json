  "summary": "The \"passport union,\" often referred to as the \"European passport,\" is a pivotal concept within EU international law, facilitating the free movement of individuals across member states. This regulatory framework allows citizens to travel, reside, and work in any EU country with a single passport, thereby promoting integration and cooperation among nations. The European passport serves as a symbol of unity, ensuring that legal and regulatory standards are harmonized, thus enhancing security and mutual recognition of identities. As a redirect to the preferred term, the passport union underscores the importance of collective rights and obligations in the context of EU citizenship.",
