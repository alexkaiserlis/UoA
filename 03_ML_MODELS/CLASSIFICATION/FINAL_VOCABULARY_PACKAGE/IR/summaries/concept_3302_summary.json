  "summary": "The term \"adopted child\" refers to a person who has been legally integrated into a family through the process of adoption, thereby acquiring the same rights and responsibilities as a biological child. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the status of an adopted child is significant for various legal matters, including inheritance rights, parental responsibilities, and access to social benefits. The EU promotes the recognition of adopted children across member states, ensuring that their legal status is protected and harmonized in family law. This concept is essential for safeguarding the welfare and rights of children within the EU's diverse legal landscape.",
