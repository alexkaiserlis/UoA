  "summary": "The concept of \"equivalence of diplomas\" within the EU legal framework pertains to the recognition of educational qualifications across member states. This regulatory mechanism ensures that diplomas obtained in one EU country are deemed equivalent to those in another, facilitating mobility for students and professionals. The principle is crucial for enhancing educational integration, promoting lifelong learning, and supporting the free movement of workers. Through various directives and regulations, the EU establishes criteria for assessing equivalence, thereby fostering mutual recognition and reducing barriers to employment and further education. This concept underpins the EU's commitment to a cohesive educational landscape.",
