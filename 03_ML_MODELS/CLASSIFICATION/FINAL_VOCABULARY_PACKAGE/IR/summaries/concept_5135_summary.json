  "summary": "The \"Quaestor of the European Parliament\" (EP) is a pivotal role within the EU's institutional framework, primarily responsible for managing administrative and financial matters that affect Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). As a representative of MEPs, the Quaestor ensures the effective allocation of resources and oversees the financial integrity of parliamentary operations. This position, while less prominent than other roles, plays a crucial part in maintaining the operational efficiency of the EP. The term \"Quaestor of the EP\" serves as the preferred designation, redirecting from the broader concept to emphasize its specific function within the European Parliament's governance structure.",
