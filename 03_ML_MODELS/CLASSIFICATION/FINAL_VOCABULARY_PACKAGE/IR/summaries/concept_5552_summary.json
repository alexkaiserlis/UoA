  "summary": "EU police cooperation is a vital aspect of the European construction aimed at enhancing security and judicial collaboration among member states. This framework rationalises the operability of various agencies, including Frontex and CEPOL, and facilitates the exchange of information through systems like Eurodac and Prüm. It addresses issues such as cross-border assaults and convictions, ensuring that individuals convicted of crimes can be prosecuted effectively across jurisdictions. The coalition of member states, tasked with maintaining public liberties, reaffirms its commitment to a unified approach, as exemplified by initiatives like EPAC. This ensemble of legal instruments is crucial for addressing contemporary challenges in policing and security.",
