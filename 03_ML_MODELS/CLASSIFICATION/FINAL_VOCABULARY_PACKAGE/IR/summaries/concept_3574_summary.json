  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"professional union\" is a redirect to \"professional association,\" which is essential in labour law and labour relations. These associations, such as the Syndicat des Constructeurs de Machines Textiles (CEMATEX) and the Verband Deutscher Maschinen- und Anlagenbau (VDMA), consist of various professions, including textile and elektrotechnische sectors. They serve as organizers that deliver collective representation and protect members' rights, often stringently adhering to obligations set forth in EU regulations. Professional associations may also expel members who fail to comply with established standards, ensuring the integrity of the profession, as seen in cases involving the Italian costruttori and the Belgian drapiers.",
