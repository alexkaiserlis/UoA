  "summary": "The term \"Community trunk route\" refers to a vital component of the European Union's transport policy framework, specifically aimed at enhancing connectivity across member states. These routes are designated to facilitate the efficient movement of goods and passengers, thereby promoting economic integration and cohesion within the EU. The establishment of Community trunk routes is governed by various legal and regulatory instruments that ensure compliance with safety, environmental, and operational standards. By prioritizing these routes, the EU seeks to optimize transport networks, reduce congestion, and support sustainable mobility initiatives, ultimately contributing to the overarching goals of the European single market.",
