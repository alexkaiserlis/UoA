  "summary": "Mixed cropping refers to the agricultural practice of cultivating two or more crops simultaneously on the same land parcel. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this method is significant for promoting biodiversity, enhancing soil health, and optimizing land use efficiency. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) encourages mixed cropping as a sustainable farming practice, aligning with environmental objectives and food security goals. By fostering crop diversity, mixed cropping can mitigate risks associated with pests and diseases, thereby contributing to the resilience of agricultural systems. This practice is increasingly recognized in EU regulations aimed at sustainable agricultural development.",
