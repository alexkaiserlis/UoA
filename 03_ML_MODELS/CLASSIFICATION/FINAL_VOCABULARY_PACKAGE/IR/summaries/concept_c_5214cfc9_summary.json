  "summary": "The concept of \"gastronomy\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses the cultural practices and culinary traditions that shape European identity. It plays a significant role in the promotion of cultural heritage, particularly through initiatives aimed at safeguarding traditional food products and practices. The EU's regulatory measures, such as the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indication (PGI), highlight the importance of gastronomy in fostering regional development and enhancing cultural diversity. By recognizing gastronomy as a vital component of culture and religion, the EU supports sustainable practices that celebrate culinary diversity while ensuring compliance with food safety regulations.",
