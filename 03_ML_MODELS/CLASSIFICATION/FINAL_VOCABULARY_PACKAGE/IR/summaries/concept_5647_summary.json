  "summary": "The \"tax-free allowance\" in EU legal and regulatory contexts refers to specific reliefs granted to residents, allowing them to consume certain consumables without incurring tax liabilities. This concept is particularly relevant for victuallers and distillers, as it impacts the reselling of branded products like whisky and scotch. Travellers, including crew members and residents, benefit from these allowances when passing through embassies or supermarkets, where they may purchase goods without hindering their entitlements. The theory behind such allowances is to support local trades and encourage consumption, while occasionally confining the scope to the smallest of items, thus embracing a balanced approach to taxation.",
