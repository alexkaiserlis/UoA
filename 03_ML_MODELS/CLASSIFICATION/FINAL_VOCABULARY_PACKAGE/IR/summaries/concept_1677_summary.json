  "summary": "International liquidity refers to the availability of liquid assets that can be readily used for international transactions and obligations. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, it is crucial for maintaining monetary stability and facilitating cross-border trade. The European Central Bank (ECB) plays a pivotal role in managing international liquidity through its monetary policy instruments, which aim to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to support economic growth and stability within the Eurozone. Effective management of international liquidity is essential for mitigating financial crises and fostering confidence in the euro as a global currency.",
