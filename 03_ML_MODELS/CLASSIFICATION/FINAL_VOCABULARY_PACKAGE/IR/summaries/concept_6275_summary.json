  "summary": "The concept of \"hypermedia\" refers to a digital framework that integrates various forms of media, such as text, audio, and video, allowing for non-linear navigation through interconnected information. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, hypermedia plays a crucial role in enhancing accessibility and user engagement with complex legal texts. It facilitates the dissemination of regulatory information by enabling dynamic links to relevant legal provisions, case law, and supplementary materials. This interactivity not only aids in compliance but also promotes transparency in the regulatory process, aligning with the EU's commitment to fostering an informed citizenry.",
