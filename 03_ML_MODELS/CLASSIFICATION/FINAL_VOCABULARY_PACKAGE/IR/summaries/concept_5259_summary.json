  "summary": "The concept of \"Caribbean Islands\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses a diverse array of issues, including disarmament and the regulation of firearms and explosives. The EU actively pursues initiatives aimed at stabilizing the region, addressing illicit trafficking and uncontrolled accumulation of arms. Programs designed to support peace, such as training academies for parliamentarians and advisors, are essential for enhancing capabilities in the Caribbean basin. The EU also engages in hemispheric forums, like the Marrakesh meetings, to encourage collaboration on disarmament and poverty reduction. Waivers and appeals may be employed to lift restrictions, thereby expanding visibility and effectiveness of these initiatives.",
