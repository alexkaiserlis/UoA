  "summary": "The concept of \"independence of people with disabilities\" is pivotal within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly in the realm of social affairs. It underscores the necessity for individuals with disabilities to exercise autonomy and participate fully in society. EU legislation, such as the European Disability Strategy, aims to dismantle barriers that hinder their independence, promoting equal opportunities and social inclusion. This concept is also enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which the EU ratified, emphasizing the importance of empowering individuals with disabilities to lead self-determined lives. Ensuring their independence is essential for fostering an inclusive society.",
