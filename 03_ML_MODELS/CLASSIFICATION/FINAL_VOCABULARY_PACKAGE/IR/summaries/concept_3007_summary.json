  "summary": "A \"partly nationalised undertaking\" refers to an organization in which the state holds a significant, but not complete, ownership stake. This legal form is particularly relevant in the context of EU regulations, as it reflects the balance between public interest and private enterprise. Such undertakings may be subject to specific regulatory frameworks that govern state aid and competition law, ensuring compliance with the EU's internal market principles. The term serves as a redirect to the preferred term \"partly nationalised undertaking,\" highlighting its importance in discussions regarding economic governance and the role of state intervention in the market.",
