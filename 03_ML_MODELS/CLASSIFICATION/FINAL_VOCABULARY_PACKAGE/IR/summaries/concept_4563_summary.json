  "summary": "The concept of \"seasonal worker\" pertains to individuals employed during specific periods, primarily in sectors such as agriculture, where the volume of work fluctuates seasonally. EU legislation aims to enable the participation of these workers, ensuring their rights and earnings are properly safeguarded. Surveys conducted by member states show that the periodicity of employment impacts the overall labour market structure. To address the burden of temporary employment, regulations may include derogating provisions that allow for the extension of rights beyond the seasonal period. Statistical data is essential for assessing the impact of such legislation, ensuring that the requirements of both workers and employers are met effectively.",
