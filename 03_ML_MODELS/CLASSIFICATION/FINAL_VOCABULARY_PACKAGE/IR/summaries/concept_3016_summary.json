  "summary": "A \"military regime\" refers to a governmental structure where military personnel hold significant power, often resulting in the repression of opposition and the deterioration of democracy. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such regimes, like those in Myanmar (formerly Burma) and Nigeria, are subject to scrutiny and sanctions. The EU employs Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) measures, including prohibiting the sale of arms and freezing assets of detained activists. These actions aim to empower democratic movements and facilitate reconciliation. The EU continuously updates its regulations, considering the implications of military governance on human rights and regional stability, as seen in countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and the Baltic states.",
