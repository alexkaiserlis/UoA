  "summary": "In the context of EU labour law and labour relations, a \"professional society\" refers to an organized body that represents the interests of a specific profession. These societies often engage in regulatory activities, including the establishment of ethical standards, certification processes, and continuing education requirements for their members. They play a crucial role in promoting professional development and ensuring compliance with legal frameworks. In the EU, professional societies may also influence policy-making by providing expertise and advocacy on issues affecting their respective fields. Their activities are essential for maintaining high standards and fostering collaboration among professionals within the EU's internal market.",
