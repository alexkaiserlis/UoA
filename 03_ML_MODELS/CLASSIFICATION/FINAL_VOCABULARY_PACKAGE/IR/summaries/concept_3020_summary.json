  "summary": "A \"parliamentary system\" refers to a political framework where the executive branch derives its legitimacy from, and is accountable to, the legislature (parliament). In the context of the European Union, this system is pivotal in shaping the governance of member states, influencing the legislative process and the formulation of EU regulations. The parliamentary system facilitates a dynamic interplay between elected representatives and the government, ensuring that policies reflect the electorate's will. This structure is essential for maintaining democratic principles within the EU, promoting transparency, and fostering accountability in decision-making processes across various regulatory domains.",
