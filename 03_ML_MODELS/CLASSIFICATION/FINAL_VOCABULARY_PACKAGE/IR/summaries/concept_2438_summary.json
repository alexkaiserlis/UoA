  "summary": "The concept of \"fresh fish\" within EU fisheries regulation encompasses various species, including squalus, acanthias, and scyliorhinus, which are subject to strict conservation measures. The EU Council emphasizes the importance of maintaining sustainable populations of pelagic species like herrings, anchovies, and mackerel. Regulatory frameworks facilitate the sizing, grading, and skinning of fish, ensuring fairer trade practices. The management of stocks, such as monkfish, hake, and lobsters, involves regular readjustment and extrapolation of quotas to prevent destabilized ecosystems. Furthermore, the processing of fish into fillets or blocks must comply with standards to avoid unsatisfactory practices, thereby promoting the conservation of species like eels and redfish.",
