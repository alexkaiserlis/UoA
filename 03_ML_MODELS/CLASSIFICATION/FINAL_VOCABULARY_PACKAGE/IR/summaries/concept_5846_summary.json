  "summary": "The concept of \"region dependent on fishing\" refers to areas within the European Union that rely heavily on fishing activities for their economic and social sustainability. These regions are often characterized by specific regulatory frameworks aimed at promoting sustainable fisheries management and protecting marine biodiversity. The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) plays a crucial role in defining the legal parameters for these regions, ensuring that fishing practices do not compromise the ecological balance. Additionally, regional policy initiatives may provide financial support and development strategies tailored to enhance the resilience of communities dependent on fishing, thereby fostering economic growth and social cohesion in these vulnerable areas.",
