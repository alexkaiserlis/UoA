  "summary": "The term \"CAEU countries\" refers to the member states of the Central Asian Economic Union, which, while not directly part of the European Union, are relevant in the context of EU economic geography. These countries are engaged in various legal and regulatory frameworks that facilitate trade and economic cooperation with the EU. Understanding the dynamics of CAEU countries is essential for EU policymakers, as it impacts economic relations, regulatory alignment, and cross-border investments. The legal frameworks governing these interactions often draw upon principles established in EU law, thereby influencing economic strategies and regulatory practices within the broader European context.",
