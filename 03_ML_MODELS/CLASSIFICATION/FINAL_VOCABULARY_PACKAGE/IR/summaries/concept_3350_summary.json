  "summary": "The \"carry-over of appropriations\" refers to the practice within EU budgetary regulations whereby uncapped appropriations from one fiscal period can be reallocated to the next. This mechanism is particularly compelling in times of crises, allowing for the effective bridging of funding gaps. When appropriations are decommitted or returned, they can be modernized and executed in subsequent budgets, thereby enhancing programmability. This process involves unanimous agreement among member states, ensuring that funds are not impaired by deductions or reallocations. The flexibility of carry-over provisions supports the EU's financial stability and facilitates the connection of resources across various subregions, including the OCTs and Cotonou partnerships.",
