  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"directive\" is a legislative act that establishes certain objectives that member states must achieve within a specified timeframe. Unlike regulations, which are directly applicable, directives require national implementation through domestic legislation, allowing flexibility in how the objectives are met. This mechanism ensures harmonization across the EU while respecting the legal traditions of individual member states. Directives play a crucial role in shaping EU law, guiding member states towards common goals, and facilitating cooperation in various sectors, including environmental protection, consumer rights, and internal market regulations.",
