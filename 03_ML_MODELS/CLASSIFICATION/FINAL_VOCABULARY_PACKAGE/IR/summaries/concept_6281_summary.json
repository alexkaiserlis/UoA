  "summary": "Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand, is situated in the South Pacific and is characterized by its unique economic geography. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, Tokelau's status as a non-self-governing territory may influence its eligibility for development aid and trade agreements under EU regulations. The EU's external action policies often consider the economic geography of such territories to ensure sustainable development and compliance with international obligations. Although Tokelau does not have direct relations with the EU, its geographical and economic characteristics can inform EU strategies regarding Pacific island nations and their integration into broader economic frameworks.",
