  "summary": "The concept of \"sea\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework encompasses various aspects of the natural environment, particularly concerning maritime and coastal regions. It plays a crucial role in regional development, as indicated by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and its investment programmes aimed at fostering cohesion across territorial and cross-border areas. The EU's Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP) sets goals for sustainable fisheries and environmental protection, facilitating cooperation among member states. Additionally, the EU supports rural and urban development through structural funds, ensuring that assistance is granted to regions least equipped to manage their maritime resources effectively. This comprehensive approach underscores the importance of the sea in achieving broader socio-economic objectives.",
