  "summary": "A \"delegated directive\" is a legal instrument within the framework of European Union law, specifically designed to supplement or amend non-essential elements of a legislative act. It allows the European Commission to adopt measures that provide detailed rules necessary for the implementation of primary legislation, thereby ensuring uniform application across member states. Delegated directives are crucial for adapting EU law to evolving circumstances without the need for a full legislative process. This mechanism enhances regulatory efficiency and responsiveness, allowing for timely updates while maintaining the integrity of the original legislative intent.",
