  "summary": "The concept of \"wildlife corridor,\" redirected to \"ecological connectivity,\" is crucial in EU legal and regulatory frameworks aimed at preserving biodiversity and promoting sustainable land use. Ecological connectivity refers to the unimpeded movement of species across landscapes, facilitating genetic exchange and enhancing resilience against environmental changes. The EU's Natura 2000 network and various biodiversity strategies underscore the importance of establishing wildlife corridors to mitigate habitat fragmentation. By ensuring ecological connectivity, these measures support the conservation of natural environments and contribute to the EU's commitment to environmental sustainability, aligning with broader objectives of the European Green Deal and the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030.",
