  "summary": "The concept of \"renewable resources\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework encompasses natural resources that can be replenished naturally over time, such as solar energy, wind energy, and biomass. The EU promotes the sustainable management of these resources to mitigate environmental degradation and combat climate change. Regulations, such as the Renewable Energy Directive, establish binding targets for member states to increase the share of renewable energy in their energy mix. This legal framework aims to enhance energy security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and foster innovation in renewable technologies, thereby contributing to a more sustainable and resilient natural environment across the EU.",
