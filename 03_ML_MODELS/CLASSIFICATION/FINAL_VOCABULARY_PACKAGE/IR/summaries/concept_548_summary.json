  "summary": "The concept of \"voting rights,\" redirected to the preferred term \"right to vote,\" encompasses the legal entitlements of citizens to participate in elections, a fundamental aspect of democratic governance within the EU. This right, formally established in various acts, allows nationals residing in member states to vote in municipal and local elections, ensuring their political participation. The evolution of voting rights has seen adaptations, such as the inclusion of citizens from new member states like Croatia and the revision of eligibility conditions in countries like Latvia and Lithuania. These adaptations reflect the EU's commitment to uphold democratic principles, inviting citizens to enjoy their rights and stand as candidates in elections. The framework surrounding voting rights is continuously updated, ensuring compliance with domestic and international standards while promoting inclusivity across the islands and units of the EU.",
