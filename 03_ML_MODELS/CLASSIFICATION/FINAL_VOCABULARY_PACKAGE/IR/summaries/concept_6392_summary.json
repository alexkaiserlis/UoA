  "summary": "The concept of \"soil type\" is pivotal in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning environmental protection, agriculture, and land use. Soil types, classified based on their physical and chemical properties, play a crucial role in determining land suitability for various applications, including agricultural practices and biodiversity conservation. EU legislation, such as the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Soil Thematic Strategy, emphasizes the importance of understanding soil types to promote sustainable land management and mitigate soil degradation. Accurate identification and assessment of soil types are essential for implementing effective environmental policies and ensuring compliance with EU regulations aimed at preserving natural resources.",
