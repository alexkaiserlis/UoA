  "summary": "The principle of legal certainty is a cornerstone of EU law, ensuring that legislation is clear, predictable, and consistent. This principle aims to prevent uncertainty by maintaining a comprehensive legal framework that facilitates the ordinary functioning of the internal market. It generates trust among parliaments and citizens, as it allows for adequate transmission of legal norms. In the absence of legal certainty, serious difficulties may arise, creating obstacles to compliance and enforcement. The latest legislative proposals must be recast to address pending matters effectively, ensuring that once enacted, they replace outdated provisions and prevent confusion in legal processes, thus promoting stability and clarity in EU regulations.",
