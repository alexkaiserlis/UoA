  "summary": "The concept of \"freedom of the skies\" pertains to international law, specifically within the context of the European Union's regulatory framework for air transport. This principle allows airlines to operate flights between any two points in the EU and beyond, promoting competition and enhancing connectivity. It is integral to the EU's Single European Sky initiative, which aims to streamline air traffic management and improve efficiency. By facilitating open access to air routes, the \"freedom of the skies\" fosters economic growth and consumer choice, aligning with the EU's broader objectives of market liberalization and integration in the aviation sector.",
