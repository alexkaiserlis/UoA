  "summary": "\"Occupational mobility,\" also referred to as \"job mobility,\" is a critical concept within the EU's labour market framework, aimed at enhancing employment opportunities for various groups, including youth, migrants, and vulnerable populations. The EU promotes policies that facilitate placement and training, ensuring that underemployment and unemployment are addressed. By modernizing vocational training and providing guidance, the EU seeks to develop flexible solutions that favour active participation in the labour market. This effort is essential for combating unemployment and promoting solidarity among workers, particularly women and handicapped individuals. The concentration on job mobility reflects the EU's commitment to reform and simplify employment policies, thereby rendering the labour market more inclusive and dynamic.",
