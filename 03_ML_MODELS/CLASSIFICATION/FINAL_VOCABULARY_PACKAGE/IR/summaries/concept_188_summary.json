  "summary": "Price control in the EU context refers to regulatory measures aimed at adapting market conditions to ensure fair pricing for essential goods and services. This entails controlling the prices charged by traders, particularly in sectors like oilseeds and sunflower products, where fluctuations can be sudden and unusual. Regulatory frameworks often involve invoiced amounts, requiring accuracy in accountancy practices to reconcile discrepancies. Price control may also include subsidies to compensate for market alterations, ensuring that consumers are not unduly burdened. The process is frequently reviewed on a quarterly basis, with forecasts guiding adjustments to prevailing prices, thus maintaining market stability and protecting consumers.",
