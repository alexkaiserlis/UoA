  "summary": "The concept of \"business-to-consumer\" (B2C) refers to transactions where businesses sell goods or services directly to consumers. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, B2C transactions are governed by various directives aimed at protecting consumer rights, ensuring fair competition, and promoting transparency. Key regulations, such as the Consumer Rights Directive, establish standards for information provision, withdrawal rights, and unfair commercial practices. The B2C model is crucial for understanding market dynamics within the EU, as it influences consumer protection laws and e-commerce regulations, thereby shaping the relationship between businesses and consumers in the single market.",
