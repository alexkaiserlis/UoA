  "summary": "Denaturing refers to the process of altering the properties of substances, particularly foodstuffs, to render them unsuitable for human consumption. In EU regulatory contexts, denaturants such as denatonium are utilized to irreversibly weaken the palatability of products like sago and albumins, ensuring they are not consumed as food. This practice is crucial for managing feedingstuff safety, especially in the case of piglets, where the use of denaturants can prevent accidental ingestion. Regulations also address the patenting of denaturing methods and the mixing of various substances, including isopropyl and benzoate, to comply with safety standards. Thoroughly understanding these regulations helps organizations regularize their practices and adapt to evolving legal frameworks.",
