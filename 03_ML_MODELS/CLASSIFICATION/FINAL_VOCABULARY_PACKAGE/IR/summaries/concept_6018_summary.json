  "summary": "Cobalt, categorized under the iron, steel, and other metal industries, plays a crucial role in various EU regulatory frameworks, particularly in relation to sustainable sourcing and environmental impact. The European Union emphasizes responsible mining practices to mitigate the adverse effects of cobalt extraction, which is often associated with human rights violations and ecological degradation. Regulatory measures, such as the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation, aim to ensure that cobalt supply chains are transparent and ethical. Additionally, cobalt's significance in the transition to green technologies, such as batteries for electric vehicles, underscores the need for stringent compliance with EU environmental standards and circular economy principles.",
