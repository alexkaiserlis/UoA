  "summary": "The concept of \"charge having equivalent effect\" pertains to measures that, while not classified as customs duties, impose a financial burden on goods imported into the EU, akin to taxes. Such charges are scrutinized under EU law to ensure fairness and prevent discrimination against foreign products. For instance, charges on goatmeet or horsemeat may arise from agricultural regulations that aim to protect local industries. The legality of these charges is often challenged in courts, where precedents are established. Discontinuing unjustified charges is crucial for maintaining a competitive market, particularly in sectors like horticoles and textiles, where synthetic fibres are prevalent.",
