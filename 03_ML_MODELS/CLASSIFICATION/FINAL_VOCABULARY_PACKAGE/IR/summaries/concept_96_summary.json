  "summary": "The concept of \"misuse of a right\" in EU civil law refers to the improper exercise of a legal entitlement, which contravenes the principles of good faith and fair dealing. This doctrine aims to prevent individuals from exploiting their rights in a manner that causes harm or detriment to others, thereby undermining the spirit of legal protections. In regulatory contexts, it serves as a safeguard against actions that, while technically lawful, are deemed abusive or excessive. The application of this principle ensures that rights are exercised responsibly, promoting equitable outcomes within the EU legal framework.",
