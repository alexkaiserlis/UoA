  "summary": "The concept of \"fruit ice cream,\" categorized under processed agricultural produce, is redirected to the preferred term \"dairy ice cream.\" This alignment is imperative for regulatory clarity, as it ensures that all foodstuff definitions abide by established EU standards. The legal framework necessitates that tenderers objectively trace the origins of ingredients, particularly when alterations in formulae occur. Ambiguities in product definitions can threaten compliance, leading to penalties for negligence. The divergence in interpretations may result in fluctuations in market parity, affecting the sale of these confectionery items. Thus, understanding the relationship between these terms is indispensable for effective tendering and regulatory adherence.",
