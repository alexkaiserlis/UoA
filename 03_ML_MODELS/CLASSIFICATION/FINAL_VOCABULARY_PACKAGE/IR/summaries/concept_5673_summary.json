  "summary": "The concept of \"economic infrastructure\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses critical structures and systems that support economic activities. It includes transport networks, energy grids, and digital infrastructures, which are essential for facilitating freedoms and cooperation among member states. The EU allocates budgets and appropriations for various projects aimed at improving these infrastructures, with defined criteria for eligibility. Mechanisms for contracting and project assessment are established to ensure that objectives are met. Through joint meetings and amendments to existing protocols, the scope of support can be extended, allowing for the identification of remaining fields that require attention and investment.",
