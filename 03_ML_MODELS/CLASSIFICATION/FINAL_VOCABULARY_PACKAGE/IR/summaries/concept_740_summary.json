  "summary": "The \"public-sector borrowing requirement,\" often redirected to the preferred term \"public borrowing,\" refers to the net amount of funds that a government must raise through borrowing to finance its budget deficit. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is crucial for maintaining fiscal discipline among member states, as stipulated in the Stability and Growth Pact. The public borrowing requirement reflects the balance between public expenditure and revenue, influencing national budgets and economic stability. Understanding this requirement is essential for compliance with EU regulations aimed at ensuring sustainable public finances across the Union.",
