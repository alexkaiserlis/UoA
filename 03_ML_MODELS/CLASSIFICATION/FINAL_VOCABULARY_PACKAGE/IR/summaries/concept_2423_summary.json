  "summary": "The \"continental shelf\" refers to the submerged landmass extending from a coastal state's shoreline to the deep ocean floor, crucial for the exploration and exploitation of natural resources. Within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the continental shelf is governed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which delineates rights and responsibilities concerning marine resources. The EU emphasizes sustainable management of these areas, ensuring environmental protection while allowing for economic activities such as fishing and mineral extraction. The legal status of the continental shelf is vital for member states to assert sovereignty and manage marine biodiversity effectively.",
