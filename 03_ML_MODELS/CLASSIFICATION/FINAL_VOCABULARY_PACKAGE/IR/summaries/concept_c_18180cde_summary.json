  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"traded option\" refers to a specific type of financial instrument known as an \"option contract.\" This contract grants the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price within a specified timeframe. The concept is crucial for the free movement of capital within the EU, as it facilitates investment and risk management across member states. By ensuring regulatory harmonization, the EU promotes the efficient functioning of financial markets, thereby enhancing economic integration and stability. The term \"traded option\" redirects to \"option contract,\" emphasizing its significance in financial transactions.",
