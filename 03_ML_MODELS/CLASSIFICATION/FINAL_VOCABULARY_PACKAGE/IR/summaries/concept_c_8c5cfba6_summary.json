  "summary": "Quantum technology refers to advanced applications of quantum mechanics, which have significant implications for various sectors, including communications, computing, and cryptography. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, quantum technology is increasingly recognized for its potential to enhance cybersecurity and data protection measures. The European Union is actively exploring regulatory approaches to foster innovation while ensuring ethical standards and compliance with existing laws. This includes addressing challenges related to intellectual property rights and cross-border data flows. As the EU seeks to position itself as a leader in quantum research and development, establishing a coherent regulatory environment is essential for harnessing its transformative capabilities.",
