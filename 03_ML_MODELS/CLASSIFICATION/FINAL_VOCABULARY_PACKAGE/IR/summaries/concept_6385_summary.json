  "summary": "Bioclimatology is a scientific discipline that examines the interactions between biological organisms and climatic conditions. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, bioclimatology plays a crucial role in environmental policy, particularly in the assessment of climate change impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. The European Union emphasizes the integration of bioclimatological research in its environmental legislation, such as the EU Biodiversity Strategy and the Climate Adaptation Strategy. This discipline informs regulatory measures aimed at mitigating adverse effects on natural habitats and promoting sustainable practices, thereby ensuring compliance with EU environmental objectives and fostering resilience in ecosystems.",
