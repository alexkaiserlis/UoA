  "summary": "The concept of \"gender-sensitive assistance,\" also referred to as \"gender-sensitive aid,\" is integral to the EU's cooperation policy framework. This approach emphasizes the necessity of integrating gender considerations into all forms of aid and assistance provided by the EU. By prioritizing gender-sensitive aid, the EU aims to address the specific needs and challenges faced by different genders, thereby promoting equality and empowerment. This concept is pivotal in ensuring that EU-funded projects and initiatives are not only effective but also equitable, fostering sustainable development that acknowledges and respects gender diversity. As a redirect, \"gender-sensitive assistance\" aligns closely with the preferred term, enhancing clarity in legal and regulatory contexts.",
