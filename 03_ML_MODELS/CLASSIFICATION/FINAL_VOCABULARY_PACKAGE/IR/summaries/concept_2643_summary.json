  "summary": "The \"sluice-gate price\" refers to a regulatory mechanism within the EU framework that governs the pricing of agricultural products, particularly in the context of fowls such as chickens, ducks, and geese. This concept is crucial for ensuring that prices remain stable and do not fluctuate excessively, which can lead to stalling in the market. The sluice-gate price achieves this by assimilating various factors, including overhead costs and the quality of preparations like pasteurization and homogenized feeds. It also considers the nutritional value of products, such as albumins and vitamins found in eggs and meats. By regulating these prices, the EU aims to support producers while ensuring consumers receive quality meals at reasonable prices. The concept is particularly noticeable in the pricing of items like sausages, livers, and stuffed preparations, which must adhere to specific standards to maintain market integrity.",
