These funds are allocated to support economic, social, and territorial cohesion, thereby fostering sustainable development across less developed regions. Governed by legal frameworks established in EU treaties and regulations, these funds facilitate investments in infrastructure, employment, and education. The regulatory mechanisms ensure compliance with EU objectives, promoting equitable growth and integration. By addressing socio-economic inequalities, EU Cohesion Policy funds play a pivotal role in enhancing the overall stability and prosperity of the Union, reinforcing the commitment to solidarity among member states.",
