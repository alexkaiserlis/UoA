  "summary": "The concept of \"pauperization,\" also referred to as \"pauperisation,\" pertains to the economic decline leading to increased poverty levels within a population, which is a significant concern in national accounts. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, pauperization can influence policy decisions aimed at social welfare and economic stability. The phenomenon is often analyzed through various socio-economic indicators, which are critical for assessing the effectiveness of EU interventions. Understanding pauperization is essential for formulating strategies that mitigate its effects, ensuring that the EU's objectives of promoting social cohesion and economic prosperity are met.",
