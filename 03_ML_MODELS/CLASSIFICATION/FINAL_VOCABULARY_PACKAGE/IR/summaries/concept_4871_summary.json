  "summary": "The \"double-chamber system,\" commonly referred to as a \"bicameral system,\" is a legislative structure characterized by the division of parliament into two distinct chambers. In the context of the European Union, this system is crucial for ensuring a balanced representation of member states and their citizens in the legislative process. The European Parliament operates as one chamber, while the Council of the European Union serves as the second, facilitating dialogue and negotiation between diverse interests. This bicameral framework enhances democratic legitimacy and accountability, allowing for comprehensive scrutiny of proposed legislation, thereby reinforcing the rule of law within the EU's regulatory landscape.",
