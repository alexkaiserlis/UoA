  "summary": "Electoral clientelism, often referred to simply as clientelism, is a political practice characterized by the exchange of goods or services for electoral support. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, clientelism raises concerns regarding the integrity of democratic processes and the equitable distribution of public resources. This practice can undermine the principles of transparency and accountability, essential to EU governance. The relationship between electoral clientelism and clientelism highlights the broader implications of such practices on political legitimacy and the rule of law, prompting regulatory scrutiny to ensure fair electoral competition and to combat corruption within member states.",
