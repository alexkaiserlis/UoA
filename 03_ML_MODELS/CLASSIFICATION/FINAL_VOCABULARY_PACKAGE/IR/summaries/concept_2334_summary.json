  "summary": "The term \"divorced person\" refers to an individual who has legally dissolved their marriage through a divorce decree. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is significant for various family law matters, including the determination of rights and obligations regarding alimony, child custody, and property division. The status of a divorced person can influence eligibility for social benefits, residency rights, and cross-border legal proceedings, particularly under regulations such as the Brussels II bis Regulation, which governs jurisdiction and recognition of divorce across member states. Understanding this status is essential for ensuring compliance with EU family law directives.",
