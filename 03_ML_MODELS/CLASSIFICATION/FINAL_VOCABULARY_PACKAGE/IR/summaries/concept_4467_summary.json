  "summary": "Torture, as defined in EU legal and regulatory contexts, refers to inhumane and degrading treatment that inflicts severe pain or suffering, often through cruel punishment methods. The EU strictly prohibits such practices, aligning with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which respects human dignity. Instruments like electric devices, batons, and cuffs are often associated with torture, as are methods involving sedation or anaesthesia that can lead to involuntary suffering. The EU works to abolish torture universally, imposing bans on exporters of related devices and ensuring that admissible evidence in legal proceedings does not stem from such inhumane practices.",
