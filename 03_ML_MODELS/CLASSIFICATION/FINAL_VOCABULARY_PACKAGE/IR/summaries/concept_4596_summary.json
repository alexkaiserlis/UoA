  "summary": "The concept of \"reunification,\" redirected to \"national unification,\" pertains to the legal and regulatory frameworks governing the integration of previously separated territories or states within the European Union. This process often involves complex negotiations and adherence to international law, particularly in contexts where historical, cultural, or political factors influence territorial claims. National unification can have significant implications for EU policies, including citizenship rights, economic integration, and regional stability. The EU's legal instruments may facilitate such processes, ensuring compliance with foundational principles like respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity while promoting peaceful resolutions to disputes.",
