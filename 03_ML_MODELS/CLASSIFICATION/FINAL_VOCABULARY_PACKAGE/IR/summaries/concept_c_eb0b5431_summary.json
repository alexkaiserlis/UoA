  "summary": "The term \"non-state actors\" refers to entities that operate independently of state control and can influence international affairs, including policy-making and regulatory frameworks. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, non-state actors encompass a diverse range of organizations, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), multinational corporations, and civil society groups. Their involvement is crucial in shaping EU policies, particularly in areas like human rights, environmental protection, and trade. The EU recognizes the importance of engaging with non-state actors to enhance democratic governance and ensure that diverse perspectives are considered in decision-making processes.",
