  "summary": "Biochemistry, a pivotal branch of natural and applied sciences, plays a crucial role in the EU's regulatory framework concerning health, agriculture, and environmental policies. It encompasses the study of chemical processes within and related to living organisms, which is essential for developing biopharmaceuticals, genetically modified organisms, and sustainable agricultural practices. The EU's regulatory bodies, such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), rely on biochemistry to assess safety and efficacy, ensuring compliance with stringent standards. This scientific discipline underpins various legislative measures aimed at protecting public health and promoting innovation within the EU market.",
