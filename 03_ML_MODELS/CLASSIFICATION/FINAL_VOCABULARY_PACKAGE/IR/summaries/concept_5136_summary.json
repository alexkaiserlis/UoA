  "summary": "The \"judgment of the Court (EU)\" refers to the authoritative decisions rendered by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which play a pivotal role in interpreting EU law. These judgments can address issues such as the annulment of contested regulations or directives, ensuring compliance with legal standards. The ECJ's decisions may also involve appeals from lower courts, such as the Court of First Instance (CFI), and can have dissuasive effects on employers neglecting employee rights. Additionally, judgments may recalibrate legal frameworks, enhancing adaptability in various sectors, including charitable societies and artistic industries. The seamless integration of these rulings into EU law supports employability and upholds societal standards, addressing offences and pressures faced by diverse stakeholders.",
