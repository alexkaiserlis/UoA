  "summary": "Soil testing, more commonly referred to as \"soil analysis,\" is a critical process within the EU's regulatory framework concerning environmental protection and agricultural practices. This concept encompasses the systematic examination of soil properties to assess its health, fertility, and contamination levels. EU legislation mandates soil analysis to ensure compliance with environmental standards, particularly in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Soil Thematic Strategy. By evaluating soil quality, authorities can implement measures to mitigate degradation and promote sustainable land use, thereby safeguarding natural resources and enhancing agricultural productivity. The term \"soil testing\" serves as a redirect to the preferred term \"soil analysis,\" emphasizing its significance in regulatory contexts.",
