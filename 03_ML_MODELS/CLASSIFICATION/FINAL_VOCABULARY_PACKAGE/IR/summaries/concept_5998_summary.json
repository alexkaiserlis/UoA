  "summary": "The concept of \"lower class\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to socio-economic stratification, particularly in the context of social inclusion and welfare policies. It reflects the challenges faced by individuals and families who experience economic disadvantage, often resulting in limited access to essential services and opportunities. The EU has established various directives and regulations aimed at addressing these disparities, promoting social cohesion, and ensuring that the rights of lower class individuals are safeguarded. This concept is integral to understanding the broader social framework that underpins EU policies aimed at fostering equality and combating poverty across member states.",
