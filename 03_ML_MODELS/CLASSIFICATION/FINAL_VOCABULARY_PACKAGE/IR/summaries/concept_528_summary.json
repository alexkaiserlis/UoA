  "summary": "The concept of \"ways and customs,\" which redirects to \"customary law,\" pertains to the unwritten norms and practices that have gained legal recognition within the European Union's legal framework. Customary law plays a crucial role in filling gaps where statutory law may be silent or ambiguous, reflecting the historical and cultural practices of member states. In EU regulatory contexts, customary law can influence the interpretation of legislation and the development of legal principles, ensuring that local customs are respected while harmonizing legal standards across the Union. Understanding this concept is essential for comprehending the interplay between national traditions and EU law.",
