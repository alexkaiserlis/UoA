  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the term \"regional office\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"regional agency.\" Regional agencies serve as pivotal business organisations that facilitate the implementation of EU policies at a local level. These entities are instrumental in fostering cooperation among member states, enhancing regional development, and ensuring compliance with EU regulations. By acting as intermediaries, regional agencies promote the alignment of local initiatives with broader EU objectives, thereby contributing to the cohesion and integration of the internal market. Their role is essential in addressing regional disparities and supporting sustainable economic growth within the EU.",
