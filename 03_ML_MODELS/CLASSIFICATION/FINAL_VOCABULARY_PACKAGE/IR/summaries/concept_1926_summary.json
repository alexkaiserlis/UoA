  "summary": "The concept of \"working environment\" encompasses the legal and regulatory frameworks that govern the organisation of work and working conditions within the European Union. It pertains to the physical, psychological, and social aspects of the workplace, ensuring that employees operate in a safe, healthy, and conducive atmosphere. EU directives, such as the Framework Directive on Safety and Health at Work, aim to enhance the quality of the working environment by establishing minimum standards and promoting best practices. This concept is crucial for fostering employee well-being, productivity, and compliance with EU labor laws, thereby contributing to a sustainable and equitable labor market.",
