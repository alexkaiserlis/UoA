  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, a \"non-flat product\" refers to items that are not produced in flat forms, such as coils, rods, or ropes, which are often subject to specific regulations. These products, including those made from çelik and aceros, are scrutinized under antidumping measures to ensure fair trade practices. Jurisprudence surrounding non-flat products often revisits issues of sufficiency and fluctuating market conditions. Manufacturers, such as Severstal and Çelik Sanayi, must navigate complex regulations, including those related to the import of metiz and halat. The EU's approach to non-flat products emphasizes the need for workable solutions and compliance with technical standards, ensuring that all parties, including those in the sanayi sector, adhere to established norms.",
