  "summary": "The \"organisation of elections\" refers to the structured process of conducting electoral procedures within the EU framework, ensuring democratic principles are upheld. This concept encompasses the preparation and supervision of elections, which are crucial for consolidating democracy and peace in regions such as Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The EU, through its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), undertakes commitments to observe and finance these electoral processes, often coordinating with organizations like the OSCE. The intention is to create a permanent foundation for democratic transitions, ensuring that elections are conducted in a positive and constitutional manner, even in challenging contexts like the Middle East and Africa. This term redirects to \"organisation of elections,\" emphasizing its significance in EU legal documents.",
