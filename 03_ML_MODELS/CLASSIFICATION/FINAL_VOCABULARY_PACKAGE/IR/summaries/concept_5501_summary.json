  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"local authority\" refers to a municipal body responsible for governance and public service delivery within designated areas, such as cities like Gdańsk, Marseille, and Milan. These authorities play a crucial role in managing local elections, overseeing communications, and ensuring compliance with regulations, including inspections at ports and airports like Malpensa and Nice. Local authorities are pivotal in representing citizens' interests, facilitating the listing of candidates for elections, and managing public services, including zootechnical inspections. Their functions may include the lifting of restrictions on nationals residing in their jurisdictions and addressing the needs of diverse communities, such as those in Antwerp and Reggio.",
