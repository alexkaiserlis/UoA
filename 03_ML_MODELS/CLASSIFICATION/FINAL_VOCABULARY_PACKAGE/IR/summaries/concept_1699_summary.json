  "summary": "The concept of \"outline law\" pertains to the foundational frameworks and principles that govern the structure of legal systems within the European Union. It serves as a preliminary delineation of legal norms and regulations, providing a scaffold for more detailed legislative texts. In EU legal and regulatory documents, outline law is crucial for ensuring coherence and consistency across diverse legal sources and branches of the law. By establishing a clear outline, it facilitates the interpretation and application of complex regulations, thereby enhancing legal certainty and predictability within the EU legal landscape.",
