  "summary": "Price regulations within the EU context refer to measures that determine and fix prices for various goods, particularly agricultural products like millet and cereals. These regulations aim to establish a standard price threshold, ensuring market stability and fair competition among producers. Organizations involved in price management must consider the qualities and characteristics of the products offered, applying coefficients to account for differences in quality. The regulations are often amended to reflect economic changes and are crucial for maintaining equivalence in pricing across member states. Such measures are essential for the common market, facilitating trade and ensuring consumer protection.",
