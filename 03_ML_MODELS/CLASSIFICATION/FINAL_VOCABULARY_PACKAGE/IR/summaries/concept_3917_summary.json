  "summary": "The concept of \"cruel and degrading treatment\" is pivotal in EU legal frameworks, particularly within the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It encompasses practices that inflict inhumane suffering, such as torture or lethal injections, and is universally condemned. The EU disapproves of methods involving electric devices, spiked cuffs, or batons that cause pain and humiliation. Judicial oversight is essential to prevent the administration of such cruel punishment, which often deteriorates individual dignity. In contexts like Kosovo, where Eulex operates, the need to respect human rights is paramount. The EU aims to broaden protections against involuntary sedation or medical interventions that may impede personal autonomy.",
