  "summary": "The \"support tariff\" concept within EU transport policy refers to a regulatory mechanism designed to organize and finance various modes of transport, particularly railways and ferries. It aims to address competitive imbalances that may arise from tariffs imposed on carriers, especially in regions like Sicily and Sardinia. By offering reductions or exemptions on charges, the support tariff seeks to reimburse operators for costs borne from providing essential services, thus creating a more equitable freight carriage environment. This mechanism serves as a reminder of the need for justification against detrimental distortions in the market, ensuring that all competitors can thrive without aggravated financial burdens.",
