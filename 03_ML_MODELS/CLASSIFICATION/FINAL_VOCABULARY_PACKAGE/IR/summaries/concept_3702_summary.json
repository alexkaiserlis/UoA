  "summary": "The concept of \"staggering of holidays\" pertains to the strategic scheduling of employee leave periods to ensure operational continuity and workforce management within the EU's social affairs framework. This practice is particularly relevant in sectors where simultaneous absences could disrupt essential services. By implementing staggered holidays, employers can mitigate the risks associated with staff shortages, thereby enhancing productivity and maintaining service quality. The EU regulatory landscape encourages such practices to promote balanced work-life integration while adhering to labor rights. This concept underscores the importance of harmonizing employee welfare with organizational efficiency in the context of EU labor regulations.",
