  "summary": "The term \"employers' confederation\" refers to an organized association representing the interests of employers within the framework of labour law and labour relations in the European Union. These confederations play a pivotal role in collective bargaining, advocating for employer perspectives in negotiations with trade unions and influencing policy-making at both national and EU levels. They contribute to the establishment of regulatory frameworks that govern employment practices, ensuring that employers' rights and responsibilities are balanced with those of employees. By fostering dialogue between stakeholders, employers' confederations are integral to shaping a cohesive labour market across the EU.",
