  "summary": "Price stability is a fundamental objective within EU economic governance, particularly under the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). It entails maintaining low and stable inflation rates, which is crucial for sustainable growth and financial adequacy. Divergences in price levels can lead to unwarranted pressures on economies, distorting the path of nominal GDP and creating deficits. The EU's adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact necessitates corrective measures whenever misalignments arise. Policymakers must remain alert to cyclical fluctuations in commodities and currencies, ensuring that updates and targeted interventions are conducive to stabilizing prices. This ongoing endeavour is essential for the long-term health of EU finances.",
