  "summary": "The concept of \"stationary economy\" is synonymous with \"economic stagnation\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Economic stagnation refers to a prolonged period of minimal or no economic growth, characterized by stagnant productivity and employment levels. In the context of EU policies, this phenomenon poses significant challenges for member states, as it can hinder compliance with economic convergence criteria and affect the stability of the Eurozone. Regulatory measures aimed at stimulating growth, such as fiscal policies and investment incentives, are crucial to address the adverse effects of economic stagnation. Understanding this concept is essential for effective economic governance within the EU.",
