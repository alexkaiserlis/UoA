  "summary": "Diplomatic relations refer to the formal interactions between states, encompassing a range of commitments and actions aimed at fostering cooperation and peace. In the context of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), these relations are crucial for addressing issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The EU often plays a role in facilitating accords, such as the Oslo Accords, and assists in the nomination of special envoys to the region. Decisions regarding diplomatic relations are adopted in accordance with treaties and council orders, which may include extended commitments and joint declarations. The aim is to enhance security and stability in the Middle East until further agreements are reached.",
