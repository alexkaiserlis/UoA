  "summary": "A \"transition economy\" refers to a nation undergoing significant economic reform, often transitioning from a centrally planned system to a market-oriented one. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such economies, including those in Burkina Faso and Madagascar, are supported through partnerships that outline milestones for development. The Cotonou Agreement, for instance, facilitates dialogue among stakeholders, ensuring credible mediation and consensus-building. This roadmap is crucial for inclusive governance, particularly during elections, as it fosters transparent political processes. The EU engages with these nations to promote stability, addressing crises and ensuring that governments fulfill their constitutional obligations while respecting the rights of all citizens.",
