  "summary": "The concept of \"reduction of sentence\" in EU criminal law refers to the legal mechanism that allows for the mitigation of a convicted individual's punishment. This reduction can occur under specific circumstances, such as exemplary behavior during incarceration, cooperation with law enforcement, or participation in rehabilitation programs. The application of this concept is governed by national laws, which must align with overarching EU principles of justice and human rights. The reduction of sentence serves not only to promote rehabilitation but also to alleviate prison overcrowding, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the criminal justice system within the EU framework.",
