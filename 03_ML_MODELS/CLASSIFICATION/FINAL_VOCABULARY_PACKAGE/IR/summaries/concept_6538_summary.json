  "summary": "Polygamy, categorized under family law in EU legal frameworks, refers to the practice of an individual being married to multiple spouses simultaneously. While polygamy is not legally recognized in most EU member states, its implications are significant in the context of immigration, family reunification, and the protection of individual rights. The EU's regulatory landscape addresses issues surrounding marital status, often prioritizing monogamous unions. Consequently, polygamous relationships may face legal challenges, particularly regarding inheritance rights, social security benefits, and recognition in cross-border contexts. The treatment of polygamy remains a complex intersection of cultural practices and legal standards within the EU.",
