  "summary": "The concept of \"geographical source of energy,\" categorized under energy policy, is redirected to the preferred term \"energy site.\" In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, an energy site refers to a specific location where energy is produced, transformed, or distributed, emphasizing the importance of geographical factors in energy sourcing. This concept is crucial for understanding regional energy policies, sustainability initiatives, and the integration of renewable energy sources within the EU. By recognizing the geographical source of energy, policymakers can enhance energy security, promote local resources, and facilitate compliance with EU energy regulations, ultimately supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.",
