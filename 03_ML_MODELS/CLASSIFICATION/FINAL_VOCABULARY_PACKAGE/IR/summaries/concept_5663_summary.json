  "summary": "The concept of \"medieval history\" encompasses the study of European history from the fall of the Roman Empire to the onset of the Renaissance, a period critical for understanding the evolution of legal and regulatory frameworks in the EU. This era witnessed the formation of early legal systems, the codification of customary laws, and the establishment of feudal rights, which laid the groundwork for modern governance. In EU legal documents, references to medieval history may arise in discussions on heritage protection, cultural rights, and the influence of historical legal traditions on contemporary EU legislation, emphasizing the importance of historical context in regulatory frameworks.",
