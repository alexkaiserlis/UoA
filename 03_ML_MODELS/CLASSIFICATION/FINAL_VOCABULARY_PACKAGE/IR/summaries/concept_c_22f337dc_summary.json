  "summary": "The principle of double jeopardy, a fundamental tenet in EU justice systems, prohibits an individual from being tried twice for the same offense. This legal safeguard ensures that once a person has been acquitted or convicted, they cannot face further prosecution for the same act, thus upholding the integrity of judicial proceedings. In the context of EU law, this principle is enshrined in various legal instruments, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It serves to protect individuals from the anxiety and potential abuse of state power inherent in repeated prosecutions, reinforcing the rule of law across member states.",
