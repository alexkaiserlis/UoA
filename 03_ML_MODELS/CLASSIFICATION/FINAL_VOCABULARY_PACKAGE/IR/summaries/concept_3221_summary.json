  "summary": "Church-State relations refer to the legal and regulatory framework governing the interaction between religious institutions and governmental authorities within the European Union. This concept encompasses various dimensions, including the delineation of powers, the protection of religious freedoms, and the secular nature of the state. In EU legal documents, church-State relations are crucial for ensuring that public service provisions respect diverse religious beliefs while maintaining the integrity of executive power. The EU promotes a balanced approach, fostering dialogue between religious entities and state institutions, thereby facilitating cooperation without compromising the fundamental principles of democracy and human rights.",
