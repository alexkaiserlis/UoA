  "summary": "Interparliamentary relations refer to the collaborative interactions and formal engagements between the European Parliament and national parliaments of EU member states. This concept is crucial in fostering dialogue, enhancing democratic legitimacy, and ensuring that the legislative processes align with the diverse interests of EU citizens. Through mechanisms such as the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union (COSAC), interparliamentary relations facilitate the exchange of information and best practices, thereby strengthening the oversight of EU legislation. These relations are essential for promoting transparency and accountability within the EUâ€™s complex regulatory framework.",
