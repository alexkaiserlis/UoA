These authorities are responsible for nominating candidates for various positions, including governors and supervisory roles, ensuring accountability and transparency in governance. They engage in dialogue with stakeholders, including investors and professionals, to deliver effective reforms. Public authorities must consult relevant statutes and adhere to strict reporting mechanisms, particularly in areas such as accounting and monetary policy. Their actions are bound by legal judgments, underscoring the importance of expertise and sensitivity in their operations.",
