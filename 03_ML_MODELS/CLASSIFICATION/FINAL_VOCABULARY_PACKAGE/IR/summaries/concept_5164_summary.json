  "summary": "The concept of \"Orthodoxy\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the established doctrines and practices of various religious traditions, particularly those recognized within member states. It encompasses the adherence to specific theological principles and rituals that define a faith's identity. In EU policy discussions, orthodoxy may influence cultural heritage preservation, religious freedom legislation, and interfaith dialogue initiatives. The EU promotes respect for diverse orthodox beliefs while ensuring compliance with fundamental rights, thereby fostering a pluralistic society. This balance is crucial for maintaining social cohesion and upholding the principles of democracy and human rights across the Union.",
