  "summary": "The \"agriculture-trade relationship\" concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks addresses the complex interplay between agricultural practices and international trade. This relationship is crucial as it can jeopardise the attainment of fair market conditions for farmers, particularly when practices such as dumping are prevalent. Discriminatory trade policies may impede the competitive positions of EU agricultural organisations, warranting attention from regulatory bodies. Proposals to eliminate prejudicial barriers are often formulated in recitals of trade agreements, ensuring that justice is served. The EU authorises protective measures unless they compromise the dominant market position of local producers, thus drawing a balance between trade facilitation and the safeguarding of agriculture.",
