  "summary": "The concept of \"temporary layoff\" refers to a legal mechanism employed by employers within the EU to suspend employees from work for a limited duration, often due to economic downturns or operational challenges. This measure allows businesses to reduce labor costs while retaining the workforce, thereby facilitating a quicker recovery when conditions improve. Temporary layoffs are governed by national labor laws and EU regulations, which aim to protect employees' rights during such periods. The implementation of this concept is crucial for maintaining employment stability and ensuring compliance with broader EU employment policies, particularly in times of economic crisis.",
