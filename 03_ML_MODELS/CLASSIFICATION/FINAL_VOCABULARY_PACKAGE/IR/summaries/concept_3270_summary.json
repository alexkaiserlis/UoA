  "summary": "The concept of \"mixed price\" in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to a pricing mechanism that combines elements of both fixed and variable pricing structures. This approach is often utilized in sectors where market conditions fluctuate, allowing for flexibility in pricing strategies. In regulatory terms, mixed pricing can be relevant in areas such as public procurement and competition law, where it may influence the assessment of fair pricing practices. Understanding mixed prices is essential for compliance with EU regulations, ensuring that pricing strategies align with principles of transparency and non-discrimination in the internal market.",
