  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"decision\" refers to a binding legal act adopted by the European Union institutions, particularly the European Commission, the Council, or the European Parliament. Decisions are essential instruments that establish obligations for specific entities, such as member states or individuals, and are pivotal in the implementation of EU policies. Unlike regulations and directives, decisions are tailored to particular cases or subjects, thereby ensuring compliance with EU law. They play a crucial role in enforcing legal standards and facilitating the harmonization of laws across the EU, thereby contributing to the integrity of the single market.",
