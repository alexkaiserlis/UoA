  "summary": "\"Joint implementation\" refers to a mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol, allowing EU member states to fulfil their binding emission reduction commitments collaboratively. This approach, inscribed in the framework of international climate agreements, enables nations to jointly undertake projects that mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. By treating emissions targets collectively, participating countries can achieve quantified reductions more efficiently. The concept was welcomed during the Doha conference, where ministers expressed their intention to endorse such collaborative efforts. Each participating nation, including Iceland and Croatia, is legally obligated to notify the secretariat of their commitments, ensuring transparency and accountability in the fulfilment of their obligations.",
