  "summary": "The \"age of majority\" is a critical legal concept within EU civil law, signifying the threshold at which an individual attains full legal capacity and is empowered to engage in binding contracts, exercise rights, and assume responsibilities. Typically set at 18 years, this age delineates the transition from minor status to adulthood, impacting various legal domains, including family law, inheritance rights, and contractual obligations. The age of majority is essential for ensuring that individuals can participate fully in civic life, thereby reinforcing the principles of autonomy and personal responsibility within the EU legal framework.",
