  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"goodwill\" refers to an intangible asset that arises when a business is acquired for a price exceeding the fair value of its identifiable net assets. This concept is pivotal in distributive trades, as it reflects the value of a company's brand reputation, customer relationships, and operational synergies. Goodwill is subject to specific accounting standards under EU regulations, which dictate its recognition and impairment testing. Understanding goodwill is essential for stakeholders in assessing the financial health and market position of enterprises within the EU, particularly during mergers and acquisitions.",
