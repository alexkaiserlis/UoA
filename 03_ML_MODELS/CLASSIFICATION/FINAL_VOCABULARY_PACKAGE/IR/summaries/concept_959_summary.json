  "summary": "The concept of \"low income\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to individuals or households whose earnings fall below a specified threshold, impacting their economic stability and access to essential services. This classification is significant in national accounts, as it informs policy measures aimed at reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion. The EU employs various indicators to assess low income levels, facilitating targeted interventions and resource allocation. Understanding low income is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of social policies and ensuring compliance with EU directives aimed at fostering equitable economic growth and safeguarding the welfare of vulnerable populations.",
