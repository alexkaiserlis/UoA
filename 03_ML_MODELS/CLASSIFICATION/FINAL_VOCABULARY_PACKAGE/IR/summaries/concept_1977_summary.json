  "summary": "Monocracy refers to a political framework characterized by the concentration of power in a single authority or individual, which stands in contrast to pluralistic governance models. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, monocracy raises concerns regarding democratic legitimacy, accountability, and the rule of law. The European Union, founded on principles of shared sovereignty and collective decision-making, typically advocates for a system that promotes checks and balances among institutions. Consequently, the concept of monocracy is often scrutinized within EU discourse, particularly in discussions about member states' adherence to democratic norms and the implications for EU integration and governance.",
