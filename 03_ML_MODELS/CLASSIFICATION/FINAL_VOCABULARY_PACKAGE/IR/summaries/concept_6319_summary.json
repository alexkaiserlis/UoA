  "summary": "In the context of EU agricultural regulations, a \"silo\" refers to a structure designed for the storage of bulk agricultural products, particularly grains and fodder. Silos play a crucial role in the means of agricultural production, facilitating the preservation and management of harvested crops. The EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) recognizes the importance of efficient storage solutions, including silos, to enhance food security and optimize resource use. Regulatory frameworks may stipulate standards for construction, safety, and environmental impact of silos, ensuring they meet both agricultural needs and sustainability objectives. Thus, silos are integral to the agricultural supply chain within the EU.",
