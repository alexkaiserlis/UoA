  "summary": "The \"repatriation grant\" is a financial mechanism within EU migration policy aimed at supporting returnees who wish to return to their home countries, particularly those who have stayed illegally. This grant is designed to reinforce the capacities of member states, such as the Estonian, Maltese, and Bulgarian authorities, in managing the complexities of migration flows. It promotes strategic programming and solidarity among nations by financing transportation facilities, including buses, for returnees. Eligibility for the grant requires compliance with ongoing EU priorities, ensuring that the fundamental rights of nationals are respected during the return process. The initiative reflects a multi-dimensional approach to migration management, considering the diverse needs of various member states, including the Finnish, Polish, and Greek contexts.",
