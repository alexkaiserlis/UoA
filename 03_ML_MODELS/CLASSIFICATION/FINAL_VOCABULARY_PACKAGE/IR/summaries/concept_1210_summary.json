  "summary": "The concept of \"war\" within the framework of EU legal and regulatory documents pertains to international security, encompassing the legal implications and regulatory measures associated with armed conflict. The EU's approach to war involves the establishment of common policies aimed at conflict prevention, crisis management, and the promotion of peace. Legal instruments such as the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) guide member states in their collective response to threats posed by war, ensuring compliance with international law and human rights standards. The EU also engages in diplomatic efforts to mitigate the impacts of war, reinforcing its commitment to stability and security in the region.",
