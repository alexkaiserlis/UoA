  "summary": "The concept of \"water requirements\" within EU environmental policy pertains to the legal and regulatory frameworks that establish the standards and conditions necessary for the sustainable management of water resources. These requirements are crucial for ensuring compliance with directives such as the Water Framework Directive, which aims to protect and enhance the quality of water bodies across member states. By delineating specific water quality and quantity standards, the EU seeks to safeguard aquatic ecosystems, promote efficient water use, and address issues related to water scarcity. Thus, \"water requirements\" serve as a foundational element in the EU's broader environmental protection strategy.",
