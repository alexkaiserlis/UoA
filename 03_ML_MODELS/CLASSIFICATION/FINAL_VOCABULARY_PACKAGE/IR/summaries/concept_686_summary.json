In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the management and disposal of radioactive effluents are governed by directives aimed at protecting human health and the environment. These regulations establish stringent guidelines for monitoring, treatment, and discharge of such effluents to mitigate their harmful effects. Compliance with these directives is essential for member states to ensure sustainable practices and prevent environmental degradation associated with nuclear activities.",
