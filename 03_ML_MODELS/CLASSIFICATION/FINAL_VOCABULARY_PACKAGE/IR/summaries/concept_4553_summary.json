  "summary": "\"Shift work\" refers to a work organization method where employees, including officials and staff, are assigned to varying schedules that correspondingly cover different times of the day or night. This employment structure is significant in the context of EU regulations, as it entails specific provisions regarding working conditions and allowances. The European Court of Justice has addressed matters related to shiftwork, determining the rights of employed individuals under various categories of employment. Proposals to amend existing regulations often seek to enhance the justice and experience of those engaged in shift work, ensuring they are entitled to appropriate conditions and rates.",
