  "summary": "The term \"retail price\" refers to the final price at which goods are sold to consumers in the market. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, retail prices are significant for ensuring transparency and fair competition among market participants. Regulations often mandate that retail prices be clearly displayed to protect consumers from misleading practices. Additionally, the European Commission monitors retail prices to assess market dynamics and consumer protection measures. Understanding retail prices is essential for compliance with EU pricing regulations, which aim to foster an equitable marketplace and safeguard consumer rights across member states.",
