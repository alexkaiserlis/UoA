  "summary": "The concept of \"ruling class\" within the EU legal framework pertains to the leadership structures that govern regions, such as the Transnistrian Republic of Moldova. The Council of the European Union often reviews and adopts decisions concerning restrictive measures aimed at these ruling classes, particularly in the context of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Such measures are usually amending existing regulations until a specified date, such as September or October, and are published in the Official Journal of the European Union. These decisions are based on treaties that establish the legal basis for action, ensuring compliance with EU standards and objectives.",
