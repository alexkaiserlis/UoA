  "summary": "The term \"investment cost\" refers to the total expenditure incurred by an entity to acquire or improve an asset, which is crucial for accurate accounting and financial reporting within the EU regulatory framework. In the context of EU legal documents, investment costs must be meticulously documented to ensure compliance with directives governing financial transparency and accountability. These costs can encompass various elements, including purchase price, installation expenses, and any ancillary costs necessary to bring the asset to operational status. Properly accounting for investment costs is essential for assessing the financial health of organizations and for fulfilling obligations under EU legislation related to public funding and investment strategies.",
