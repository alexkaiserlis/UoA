  "summary": "Short-term financing refers to the provision of capital for a limited duration, typically less than one year, aimed at addressing immediate financial needs. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, it plays a crucial role in facilitating liquidity for businesses and public entities. This form of financing is often governed by specific regulations to ensure transparency, protect investors, and promote financial stability within the internal market. Short-term financing instruments may include loans, credit lines, and commercial paper, which are essential for managing cash flow and operational expenses, thereby supporting economic growth and investment in the EU.",
