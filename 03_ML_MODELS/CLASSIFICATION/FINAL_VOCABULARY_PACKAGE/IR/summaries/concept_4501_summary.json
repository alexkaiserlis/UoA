  "summary": "Transliteration is a critical process in the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, facilitating the conversion of text from one script to another while preserving phonetic sounds. This technique is essential for ensuring accurate representation of names, terms, and legal references across diverse languages within the EUâ€™s multilingual framework. By employing transliteration, legal texts maintain clarity and consistency, which is vital for cross-border legal interpretations and compliance. This process supports information processing systems by enabling precise retrieval of documents, thereby enhancing accessibility and understanding of EU legislation among member states and stakeholders, ultimately promoting effective communication and legal harmonization.",
