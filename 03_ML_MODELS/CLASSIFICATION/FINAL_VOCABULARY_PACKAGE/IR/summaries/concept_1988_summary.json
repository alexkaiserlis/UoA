  "summary": "The \"monetary compensatory amount\" is a regulatory measure within EU agricultural policy designed to counteract market imbalances. This compensatory mechanism is derived from the need to realign agricultural prices and ensure minimal disruption to farmers' incomes. By providing financial support, it neutralizes the effects of price fluctuations and forestalls potential defection from agricultural production. The determination of these amounts is based on specific criteria, ensuring that they are deductable and effectively cover the costs incurred by producers. Such measures promote solidarity within the agricultural sector, facilitating a stable environment for diverse cuisines, including haloumi and tulum peyniri, while supporting organizations like Oxfam in their efforts to enhance agricultural resilience.",
