Within the context of EU environmental policy, this concept encompasses activities such as mineral extraction, energy production, and biodiversity conservation. The EU's regulatory approach aims to balance economic interests with environmental protection, ensuring sustainable practices that mitigate adverse impacts on marine ecosystems. Relevant directives and regulations, such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, establish guidelines for monitoring and managing sea-bed exploitation, promoting responsible stewardship of marine resources while safeguarding ecological integrity.",
