  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"downgrading\" refers to the process of \"demotion\" within personnel management and staff remuneration. This concept involves a reduction in an employee's rank or position, often accompanied by a decrease in responsibilities and remuneration. Demotion can arise from various factors, including performance issues or organizational restructuring. The regulatory implications of demotion are significant, as they must comply with established labor laws and internal policies to ensure fair treatment of staff. Understanding the nuances of demotion is essential for maintaining equitable personnel management practices within EU institutions.",
