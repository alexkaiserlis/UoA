  "summary": "\"Irradiated fuel\" refers to nuclear fuel that has undergone fission in a reactor, resulting in the production of radioactive isotopes. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, irradiated fuel is subject to stringent safety and environmental regulations. The European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) establishes guidelines for the management, storage, and disposal of irradiated fuel to mitigate risks associated with radiation exposure and environmental contamination. Compliance with these regulations is crucial for member states to ensure the safe handling of nuclear materials and to promote sustainable practices within the electrical and nuclear industries, thereby safeguarding public health and the environment.",
