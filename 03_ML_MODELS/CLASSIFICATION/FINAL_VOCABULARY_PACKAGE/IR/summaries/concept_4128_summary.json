  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"remotest region\" is a redirect to \"peripheral region,\" which encompasses areas characterized by their geographical isolation and underdeveloped economies. These regions, such as Tristan da Cunha and Ascension Island, often face challenges in maintaining livelihoods and cohesiveness due to their distance from central markets. The EU's policies aim to support these outlying areas through regularisations and funding mechanisms like the EDGGF, which help to stabilise their economies. By addressing issues such as mechanisation and agglomerations, the EU seeks to enhance the prospects of these regions, ensuring they are not left unaccounted in broader economic strategies.",
