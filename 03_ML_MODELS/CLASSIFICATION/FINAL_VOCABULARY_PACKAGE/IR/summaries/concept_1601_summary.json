  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"legitimacy\" refers to the acceptance and recognition of authority, governance, and legal norms within the Union. It encompasses both the procedural and substantive aspects of law, ensuring that decisions made by EU institutions align with democratic principles and the rule of law. Legitimacy is crucial for fostering public trust and compliance, as it underpins the validity of EU actions and policies. The concept also intersects with notions of accountability and transparency, which are vital for maintaining the integrity of the EU's political framework and enhancing citizen engagement in the democratic process.",
