  "summary": "Consumer behaviour in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to the patterns and motivations influencing consumers' choices and satisfaction levels. It is crucial for understanding how facilitators, such as promotional strategies and interoperability of services, can stimulate demand across liberalised markets. The significance of consumer awareness is underlined by the need for coherent regulations that address barriers to choice and ensure fair competition among players. Regulatory measures often involve compulsory preselection processes, enabling consumers to navigate networks effectively. As operators strive to stabilize revenue streams, the focus on qualitative aspects of consumer behaviour becomes increasingly important, particularly in sectors like telecommunications and floricultural markets, where dynamics are rapidly evolving.",
