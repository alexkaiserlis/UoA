  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, a \"wage earner\" refers to an employee who derives income from their labor, often enshrined in collective agreements that safeguard their rights. This concept is crucial for understanding demography and mobility within the labor market, particularly for posted workers and migrants. Wage earners face various variables, including nationality and occupational choices, which can impact their financial stability, pension rights, and invalidity benefits. The EU promotes entrepreneurship and the preservation of workers' rights, ensuring that employers do not impede their freedoms. Judgments on wage earners' rights are designed to be unanimous, protecting families and enhancing their quality of life.",
