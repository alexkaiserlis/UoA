  "summary": "A \"genomic library,\" also referred to as a \"genetic database,\" is a comprehensive collection of DNA sequences that serves as a critical resource in natural and applied sciences, particularly in genetic research and biotechnology. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such databases are subject to stringent data protection regulations, ensuring the ethical use of genetic information. The establishment and maintenance of a genetic database must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant directives, which govern the handling of personal data, including genetic data.
