  "summary": "The concept of \"rapid-transit railway,\" redirected to \"high-speed transport,\" encompasses advanced rail systems designed for efficient passenger and freight movement across the EU. These systems utilize innovative technologies such as the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) and telematic applications, ensuring interoperability and safety. Key parameters include compliance with Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI), which govern subsystems like signalling and locomotives. The integration of systems like eurobalise and telepowering enhances accessibility and maximises operational efficiency. Regulatory frameworks, such as the European Railway Agency (ERA) recommendations, guide the construction and reorganisation of infrastructure, addressing noise and radiation concerns while facilitating cross-border transport.",
