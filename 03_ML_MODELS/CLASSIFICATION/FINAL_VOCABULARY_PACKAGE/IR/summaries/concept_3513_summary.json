  "summary": "Criminal liability refers to the legal responsibility of an individual or entity for committing a crime, which is a fundamental concept within EU criminal law. It encompasses the principles that determine when a person can be held accountable for unlawful actions, including the requisite mental state (mens rea) and the act itself (actus reus). In the EU context, harmonization of criminal liability standards across member states is essential to ensure effective enforcement of laws and to uphold the rule of law. This concept is pivotal in addressing transnational crime, safeguarding fundamental rights, and fostering judicial cooperation among EU nations.",
