  "summary": "The concept of \"national statistics\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses the systematic collection, validation, and dissemination of data across various sectors. This endeavor is crucial for ensuring the legibility and authenticity of economic analyses, which inform policy decisions. National statistics are governed by methodological classifications, such as ISIC, and are essential for reconciling discrepancies in data reporting among member states. The European Statistical System (ESS) facilitates the screening and scheduling of statistical activities, ensuring uniformity in data collection. By approving decrees and authorizations, the ESS helps preserve the integrity of national statistics, which are vital for assessing liabilities and making informed choices regarding economic policies, including taxation and agricultural regulations.",
