  "summary": "\"Free-range poultry keeping,\" also referred to as \"free-range farming,\" is an agricultural activity regulated within the European Union to ensure animal welfare and environmental sustainability. This practice allows poultry to roam freely outdoors, promoting natural behaviors and improving the quality of life for the animals. EU regulations, such as Council Directive 2007/43/EC, set specific standards for free-range systems, including minimum space requirements and outdoor access. The shift towards free-range farming reflects a growing consumer demand for ethically produced food, aligning agricultural practices with broader EU objectives of sustainability and animal welfare. As such, \"free-range poultry keeping\" serves as a crucial component of modern EU agricultural policy.",
