  "summary": "A \"political group (EP)\" refers to a collective of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) who share similar political ideologies and collaborate to influence legislative processes within the European Union. These groups play a crucial role in shaping EU policies and decisions, as they facilitate coordinated action and debate among MEPs. Each political group must consist of at least 25 MEPs from a minimum of seven EU member states, ensuring a diverse representation. This concept is essential for understanding the dynamics of the European Parliament and its regulatory framework, as it underscores the importance of political alignment in legislative activities.",
