  "summary": "The \"rules of procedure\" in the EU context are essential for the establishment of coherent and effective governance structures. These rules transform the operational frameworks of various committees and tribunals, ensuring that sessions are conducted homogeneously and ethically. They resolve disagreements through clearly defined processes, including the use of teleconferencing and virtual sessions. The rules oversee the interoperation of different bodies, such as COREPER and GSC, and facilitate the participation of visitors and NGOs. By affirming the roles of arbitrators and advisors, these procedures harmonise the legislative process, allowing for powerful and constructive dialogue among stakeholders. Additionally, they address reputational concerns and indemnities, ensuring a robust framework for decision-making.",
