  "summary": "A \"private member's bill,\" also known as a \"non-government bill,\" is a legislative proposal introduced by a member of a parliament who is not part of the government. In the context of EU parliamentary proceedings, such bills allow individual legislators to address specific issues or propose reforms independently of the executive branch. This mechanism enhances democratic participation and enables diverse perspectives within the legislative process. While non-government bills may not always lead to law, they can stimulate debate and influence governmental priorities. The term \"private member's bill\" is thus redirected to \"non-government bill\" to reflect its broader application in EU legal frameworks.",
