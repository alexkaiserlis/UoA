  "summary": "\"Political Islam\" refers to the ideological framework that seeks to integrate Islamic principles into political governance and public policy. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, this concept is significant as it intersects with issues of religious freedom, secularism, and anti-terrorism measures. The EU's approach to political Islam involves balancing the protection of democratic values and human rights with the need to address potential extremism. Regulatory frameworks may address the implications of political Islam on social cohesion, integration policies, and counter-radicalization efforts, reflecting the EU's commitment to uphold both security and pluralism in its member states.",
