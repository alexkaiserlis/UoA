  "summary": "Foreign aid, as defined within the EU's cooperation policy framework, encompasses monetary assistance and support provided by member states to third countries. This operation is guided by treaties and decisions of the European Parliament and the Council, ensuring that such aid aligns with established policies and international relations. The European Commission plays a crucial role in the ordination of these efforts, holding consultations to formulate recommendations that address economic and social needs. The appropriate method for delivering aid is often outlined in community directives, reflecting the EU's commitment to fostering development and stability in the field of international cooperation.",
