  "summary": "The term \"freshwater ecosystem\" refers to the intricate biological communities and their habitats found in freshwater environments, such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these ecosystems are vital for biodiversity conservation, water quality management, and sustainable development. The EU's Water Framework Directive emphasizes the protection and restoration of freshwater ecosystems to ensure ecological integrity and resilience against anthropogenic pressures. Effective governance of these ecosystems is crucial for maintaining ecosystem services, promoting environmental sustainability, and adhering to international biodiversity commitments. Thus, freshwater ecosystems are integral to EU environmental policy and regulatory measures.",
