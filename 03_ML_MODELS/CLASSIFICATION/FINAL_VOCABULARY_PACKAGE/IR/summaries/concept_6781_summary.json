  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"essential needs,\" redirected to \"basic needs,\" encompasses the fundamental requirements for living, including income, material goods, and social services. This concept is integral to the systematic analysis of poverty and deprivation, as outlined in the EU's statistical frameworks, such as the SILC (Statistics on Income and Living Conditions). The longitudinal data collected incorporates various identifiers and variables, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of exclusion and the levels of deprivation across different areas. By establishing a common framework, EU regulations target timely interventions to address these needs, ensuring that all citizens can achieve a decent standard of living.",
