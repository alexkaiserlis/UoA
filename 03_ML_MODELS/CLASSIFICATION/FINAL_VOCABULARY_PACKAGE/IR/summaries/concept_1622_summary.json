  "summary": "The concept of \"media freedom,\" often referred to as \"freedom of the press,\" is a fundamental right within EU legal frameworks, categorized under rights and freedoms. This essential principle is designed to ensure that authorities in member countries respect and implement measures that protect journalists and media organizations from violations. In recent months, several initiatives have been taken to address problems identified during consultations concerning media freedom, particularly in countries like Guinea and the Republic of Guinea. The EU has engaged in intensive dialogue with ACP states, aiming to remedy issues and foster lasting partnerships. Specific proposals have been signed to enhance the implementation of these rights, with a focus on substantive elements that promote a free and independent media landscape.",
