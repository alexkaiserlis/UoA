It aims to enhance territorial cohesion and promote cross-border cooperation, particularly in the Mediterranean and Eastern basins. The ENI facilitates investment through various programmes, including the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). By laying out a framework for global cooperation, the ENI indicates the EU's commitment to social and economic development, providing assistance to rural and maritime communities. The total amounts granted under this instrument are crucial for achieving the EU's strategic goals in the region.",
