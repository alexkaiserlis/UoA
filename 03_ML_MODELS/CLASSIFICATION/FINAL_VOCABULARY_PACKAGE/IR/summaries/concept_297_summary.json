  "summary": "A documentary credit is a financial instrument widely utilized in international trade, serving as a guarantee from a bank on behalf of a buyer to pay a seller upon presentation of specified documents. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, documentary credits are governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600), which standardizes practices to mitigate risks associated with cross-border transactions. This instrument enhances trust and facilitates liquidity by ensuring that payment is contingent upon the fulfillment of contractual obligations, thus playing a vital role in the operations of financial institutions and credit systems within the EU.",
