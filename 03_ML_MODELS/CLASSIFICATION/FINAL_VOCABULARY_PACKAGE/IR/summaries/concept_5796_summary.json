  "summary": "The \"common visa policy,\" redirected to \"EU visa policy,\" encompasses the regulatory framework governing visa issuance across EU member states. This policy aims to establish a functioning system that facilitates travel while ensuring security against falsified documents and irregular entries. It initiates standardized procedures for consulates, enabling efficient processing of applications from diverse nationalities, including Ethiopian, Nigerian, and Palestinian applicants. The policy also addresses distinctions among visa types, such as those for stateless individuals or activists. By underlining the importance of cooperation, the EU visa policy serves as a roadmap for member states, enhancing mutual recognition and accomplishing common goals in border management.",
