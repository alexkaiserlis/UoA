  "summary": "Roman law, a foundational legal system originating in ancient Rome, significantly influences contemporary legal frameworks, including those within the European Union. It encompasses principles such as equity, legal interpretation, and codification, which are integral to the development of civil law systems across EU member states. The legacy of Roman law is evident in various EU regulations and directives, which often reflect its doctrines. Understanding Roman law is essential for legal practitioners and scholars navigating the complexities of EU law, as it provides a historical context for the evolution of legal norms and the harmonization of laws across diverse jurisdictions.",
