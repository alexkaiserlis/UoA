  "summary": "The term \"Warsaw Pact countries\" refers to the member states of the Warsaw Pact, a collective defense treaty established in 1955 among eight communist states in Eastern Europe, primarily in response to NATO. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, understanding the geopolitical landscape shaped by these countries is crucial for analyzing historical treaties, security policies, and economic relations. Although the Warsaw Pact was dissolved in 1991, its legacy influences current EU relations with Eastern European nations. This concept serves as a redirect to the preferred term, highlighting its relevance in discussions of political geography and regional stability within EU documentation.",
