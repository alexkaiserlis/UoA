  "summary": "Inter-communal cooperation, often referred to as the \"association of local authorities,\" is a legal framework within the EU that facilitates collaboration among municipalities. This concept is pivotal in enhancing executive power and public service delivery at the local level. By fostering partnerships, local authorities can pool resources, share expertise, and undertake joint initiatives, thereby improving efficiency and effectiveness in governance. Such associations are essential for addressing cross-border challenges and ensuring cohesive regional development. The redirect to \"association of local authorities\" underscores the primary terminology used in EU regulatory documents, emphasizing the importance of cooperative governance in achieving public service objectives.",
