  "summary": "The \"right of personal portrayal\" is a fundamental aspect of individual rights and freedoms within the EU legal framework. This concept safeguards an individual's autonomy over their image and representation, ensuring that any portrayal is consensual and respects personal dignity. It intersects with privacy rights and data protection regulations, particularly under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The right of personal portrayal is essential in preventing unauthorized use of an individual's likeness, thereby reinforcing the broader principles of personal integrity and respect for private life as enshrined in EU law. This right is pivotal in promoting individual empowerment and protecting against exploitation.",
