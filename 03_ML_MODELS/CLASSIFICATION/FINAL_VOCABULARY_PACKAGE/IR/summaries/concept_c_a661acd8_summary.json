  "summary": "The \"whole-of-government approach\" is a strategic framework employed within the European Union to enhance coherence and coordination among various governmental entities in policy-making and implementation. This approach emphasizes the integration of diverse public service sectors, ensuring that executive power is exercised in a unified manner. By fostering collaboration across ministries and agencies, the whole-of-government approach aims to address complex societal challenges effectively, promoting efficiency and consistency in regulatory actions. This concept is particularly relevant in the context of EU governance, where multi-level interactions between national and supranational authorities necessitate a holistic perspective for optimal policy outcomes.",
