  "summary": "A \"limited partnership\" is a specific legal form of organisation recognized within EU regulatory frameworks. It consists of at least one general partner, who has unlimited liability, and one or more limited partners, whose liability is restricted to their capital contributions. This structure allows for a combination of active management by general partners and passive investment by limited partners, making it attractive for various business ventures. In the context of EU law, limited partnerships are governed by national regulations, which must align with overarching EU directives on corporate governance and liability. This ensures a harmonized approach to business operations across member states.",
