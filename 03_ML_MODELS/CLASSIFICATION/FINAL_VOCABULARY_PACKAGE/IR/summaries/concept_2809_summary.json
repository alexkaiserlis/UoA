  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"proposal (EU)\" refers to a formal suggestion put forth by the European Commission or other EU institutions aimed at normalising legislation across member states. Such proposals can address various sectors, including the bottling industry, where issues like overcapacity and the attractiveness of packaged goods are critical. The proposal process often involves persuasive arguments to deflect opposition and ensure compliance. For instance, proposals may seek to recover market stability in regions like Malaysia or Iran, while addressing concerns about deteriorating conditions in the retail sector. The likelihood of acceptance can be influenced by the proposal's ability to undercut existing practices and resonate with stakeholders, including bottlers and retailers.",
