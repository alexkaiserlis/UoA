  "summary": "Maoism, as a political framework, refers to the ideological and revolutionary principles derived from the teachings of Mao Zedong. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, Maoism may be referenced in discussions regarding political extremism, human rights implications, and the regulation of political movements. The EU's commitment to democratic values necessitates scrutiny of ideologies that advocate for radical change through revolutionary means. While Maoism itself is not a predominant focus in EU policy, its historical significance and the potential for its resurgence in political discourse warrant consideration in the broader framework of political regulation and the safeguarding of democratic institutions.",
