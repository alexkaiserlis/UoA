  "summary": "Denominational education refers to educational systems or institutions that are affiliated with specific religious denominations. Within the EU legal and regulatory framework, denominational education is recognized for its role in promoting cultural and religious diversity. Member States are encouraged to respect the right to freedom of religion, which includes the provision of denominational education. This concept intersects with various EU policies on education, human rights, and non-discrimination, ensuring that such educational practices align with broader EU values. While denominational education is supported, it must also adhere to regulations that promote inclusivity and equality in the educational landscape.",
