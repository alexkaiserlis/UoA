  "summary": "The concept of \"São Tomé and Príncipe\" pertains to the economic geography of this sovereign nation, which is crucial for EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly in the context of fishing rights and jurisdiction over maritime waters. The EU has adopted definitive agreements that empower fishermen from member states to pursue fishing opportunities in these waters, which are vital for sustainable catches. The uninterrupted allocation of fishing authorisations is imperative for maintaining the economic viability of both the EU and São Tomé and Príncipe. Modifications to these agreements are often initialled during negotiations, ensuring that the contents reflect the evolving patterns of migratory fish stocks. The signature of these accords confirms the commitment to shared resources while respecting the sovereignty of São Tomé and Príncipe.",
