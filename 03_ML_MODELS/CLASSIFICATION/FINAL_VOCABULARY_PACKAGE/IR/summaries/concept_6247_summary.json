  "summary": "Eastern Finland, encompassing regions such as Savo, Kainuu, and Karelia, is a significant area within the EU Member States, particularly in the context of regional development and funding. Governed by statutory frameworks, it benefits from various EU financial instruments, including the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Investment Bank (EIB). These funds support priorities like rural development and aquaculture, ensuring compatibility with broader EU objectives. The programming and accounting structures are designed to fulfill eligibility criteria, with additionality and inflation considerations factored into project financing. Partners in Eastern Finland are actively preparing to meet these challenges, guided by indexed texts that provide a breakdown of expected outcomes and reserved funding.",
