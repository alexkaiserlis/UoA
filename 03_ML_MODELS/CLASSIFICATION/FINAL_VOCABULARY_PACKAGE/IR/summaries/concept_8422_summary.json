  "summary": "Direct democracy refers to a political framework wherein citizens directly participate in decision-making processes, rather than through elected representatives. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, direct democracy is significant as it enhances citizen engagement and accountability within the Union. Mechanisms such as the European Citizens' Initiative exemplify this concept, allowing EU citizens to propose legislation directly. This participatory approach aims to strengthen democratic legitimacy and foster a more inclusive governance structure. By facilitating direct involvement, the EU seeks to bridge the gap between institutions and citizens, thereby reinforcing the foundational principles of democracy within its regulatory framework.",
