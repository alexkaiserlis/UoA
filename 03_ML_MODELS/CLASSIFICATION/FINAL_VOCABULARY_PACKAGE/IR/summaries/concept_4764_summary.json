  "summary": "Preferential voting is an electoral procedure that allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference rather than selecting a single candidate. This method is designed to enhance voter expression and ensure that elected representatives more accurately reflect the electorate's preferences. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, preferential voting can influence the composition of the European Parliament and other institutions, promoting a more representative democracy. By facilitating a broader range of choices, this voting system aims to mitigate the effects of vote splitting and enhance the legitimacy of elected officials within the EU governance structure.",
