  "summary": "The concept of \"reform of a law,\" which redirects to \"amendment of a law,\" is pivotal in EU lawmaking processes. It involves the formal modification of existing legislation to address obsolete provisions or to enhance regulatory frameworks. Such amendments may include provisions for compensatory measures, like indemnities for affected stakeholders, and strategies for resource allocation in sectors such as fisheries and aquaculture. For instance, reforms may target the management of coastal fisheries, ensuring sustainable practices for species like cod, tuna, and sardines. By remedying incompatible regulations and halting outdated practices, the EU aims for a progressive legal environment that supports active producers and efficient resource storage, while maintaining compliance with quantitative quotas and flag state obligations.",
