  "summary": "The \"allocation of resources\" within the context of EU economic policy refers to the systematic distribution of financial, human, and material assets to achieve optimal economic outcomes. This concept is pivotal in regulatory frameworks, guiding member states in prioritizing investments that foster sustainable growth and cohesion. Effective allocation mechanisms are essential for ensuring that resources are directed towards areas that enhance competitiveness and innovation, thereby addressing regional disparities. The EU employs various instruments, such as the European Structural and Investment Funds, to facilitate this process, ensuring that resources are utilized efficiently and equitably across the Union.",
