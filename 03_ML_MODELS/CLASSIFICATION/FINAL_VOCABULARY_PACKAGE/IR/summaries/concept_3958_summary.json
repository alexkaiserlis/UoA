  "summary": "\"Conditional release,\" also referred to as \"conditional discharge,\" is a legal concept within EU criminal law that allows for the early release of an offender under specific conditions. This mechanism serves to reintegrate individuals into society while ensuring compliance with stipulated requirements, such as regular reporting to authorities or participation in rehabilitation programs. The conditional discharge aims to balance the interests of justice with the potential for rehabilitation, reducing recidivism rates. In EU regulatory frameworks, this concept underscores the importance of proportionality and individual assessment in sentencing, reflecting a commitment to restorative justice principles within member states' legal systems.",
