  "summary": "The concept of \"religion\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework encompasses the recognition and protection of diverse religious beliefs and practices. It is integral to the promotion of cultural pluralism and social cohesion in member states. The EU's commitment to fundamental rights, as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, underscores the importance of religious freedom. This includes safeguarding individuals from discrimination based on religion and fostering dialogue among different faiths. The EU's regulatory instruments aim to balance the rights of religious communities with the principles of secular governance, ensuring respect for both cultural heritage and individual liberties.",
