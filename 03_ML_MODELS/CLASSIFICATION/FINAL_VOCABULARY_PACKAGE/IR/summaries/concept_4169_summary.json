  "summary": "Non-woven fabric refers to a textile material produced by bonding fibers together through mechanical, thermal, or chemical processes, rather than traditional weaving or knitting. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, non-woven fabrics are significant within the leather and textile industries, particularly regarding compliance with environmental standards and product safety regulations. The European Union regulates the use of non-woven fabrics under various directives, ensuring that these materials meet specific criteria for sustainability and consumer protection. As the market for non-woven fabrics expands, adherence to EU regulations becomes crucial for manufacturers and importers in maintaining compliance and ensuring quality.",
