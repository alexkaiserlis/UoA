  "summary": "The concept of \"underground railway\" pertains to the organization of transport within the European Union, specifically addressing the regulatory frameworks governing subterranean transit systems. These systems are integral to urban mobility, facilitating efficient transport while minimizing surface congestion. EU legislation often emphasizes safety standards, environmental impact assessments, and interoperability among member states' transport networks. The underground railway's role in sustainable urban development is increasingly recognized, prompting regulatory bodies to establish guidelines that promote innovation and investment in this sector. As such, the underground railway is a vital component of the EU's broader transport policy objectives, enhancing connectivity and accessibility across regions.",
