  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"lease\" refers to a contractual agreement whereby one party, the lessor, grants another party, the lessee, the right to use a property for a specified period in exchange for rent. This concept is crucial in construction and town planning, as it governs the legal relationships surrounding the use of land and buildings. Leases can encompass various terms and conditions, including maintenance obligations and permissible uses, thereby impacting urban development and regulatory compliance. Understanding lease agreements is essential for stakeholders involved in real estate transactions and urban planning initiatives within the EU.",
