  "summary": "Histology, a pivotal branch of natural and applied sciences, pertains to the microscopic examination of biological tissues. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, histology plays a crucial role in various sectors, including healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and environmental monitoring. Regulatory bodies may reference histological analyses to ensure compliance with health and safety standards, particularly in assessing tissue samples for disease diagnosis or in evaluating the impact of substances on human health. The integration of histological data is essential for informed decision-making and policy formulation, thereby enhancing the efficacy of regulatory measures across the EU.",
