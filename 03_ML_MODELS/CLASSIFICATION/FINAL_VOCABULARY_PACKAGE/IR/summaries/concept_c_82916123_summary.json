  "summary": "The concept of \"ecological footprint\" within the framework of EU environmental policy refers to a quantitative measure of human demand on the Earth's ecosystems. It assesses the amount of natural resources required to sustain a population's lifestyle, juxtaposed against the planet's ecological capacity. In EU regulatory documents, the ecological footprint serves as a critical indicator for evaluating sustainability practices and formulating policies aimed at reducing environmental impact. By integrating this concept into legislative measures, the EU aims to promote resource efficiency and mitigate climate change, thereby fostering a transition towards a more sustainable and resilient economy.",
