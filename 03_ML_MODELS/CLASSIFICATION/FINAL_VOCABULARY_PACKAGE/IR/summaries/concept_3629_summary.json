  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"hoisting\" is redirected to the preferred term \"handling,\" which encompasses the management of loads in various workplace environments. The handling of heavy or medium-sized loads poses significant risks, especially related to worker safety and injury prevention. Stringent directives and proposals aim to improve workplace conditions by imposing standards that encourage better handling practices. These regulations are designed to address constraints and enhance hygiene and safety, ensuring that workers can operate without undue risk. Effective communication and consultation among stakeholders are essential for achieving improvements in handling practices, thus fostering a safer working environment.",
