  "summary": "The concept of \"international law - national law\" pertains to the intricate relationship between domestic legal frameworks and overarching international legal obligations within the EU context. This relationship is critical as EU member states must harmonize their national laws with international treaties and regulations, ensuring compliance with EU directives and regulations. The interplay between these two legal spheres often necessitates judicial interpretation and legislative adaptation to maintain coherence and uphold the rule of law. As a redirect to the preferred term, this concept emphasizes the necessity for national legal systems to align with international legal standards, thereby fostering a unified legal order across member states.",
