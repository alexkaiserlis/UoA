  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"political minority\" refers to a group within a legislative body that holds a smaller number of seats compared to the majority but still possesses significant influence over political discourse and decision-making processes. This concept is crucial for ensuring representation and safeguarding the rights of diverse political opinions within democratic institutions. Political minorities can impact legislation, participate in coalition-building, and advocate for specific interests, thereby contributing to the pluralistic nature of EU governance. Their role is essential in maintaining a balance of power and fostering inclusive dialogue in political arenas.",
