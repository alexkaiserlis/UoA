  "summary": "Judicial independence, also referred to as the \"independence of the judiciary,\" is a fundamental principle within the EU's legal framework, ensuring that judges operate free from external pressures or influences. This independence is central to upholding democracy and human rights, particularly in areas involving electoral processes and the protection of persons' rights. In recent years, the gravity of threats to judicial independence has led to discussions on imposed restrictions and the suspension of officials in certain member states, such as Belarus. The EU has agreed to review these situations, extending its actions to lift or reapply restrictions as necessary, whilst ensuring that progress is made in safeguarding judicial integrity across the Union.",
