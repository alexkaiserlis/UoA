  "summary": "In the context of EU international trade, a \"sensitive product\" refers to goods that are subject to special tariff rates and regulatory considerations due to their importance in maintaining competitive sectors within the economy. The EU stipulates reductions and charges on these products, particularly for regions such as the Canary Islands and Portugal, where geographical factors and insular circumstances justify specific measures. These products are often supplied from Spain and other member states, deriving from protocols that authorize particular treatments. The continuation of these arrangements is crucial for improvements in local economies, ensuring that sensitive products are properly managed in trade agreements.",
