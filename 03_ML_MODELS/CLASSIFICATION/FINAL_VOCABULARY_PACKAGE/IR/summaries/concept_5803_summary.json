  "summary": "The concept of \"prehistory\" pertains to the study of human history prior to the advent of written records, encompassing the analysis of archaeological findings and cultural developments. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, prehistory may inform cultural heritage policies and the protection of archaeological sites. Understanding prehistory is crucial for the EU's regulatory frameworks that aim to preserve historical artifacts and promote cultural diversity. Moreover, it plays a role in the formulation of educational programs and initiatives that enhance public awareness of Europeâ€™s rich historical tapestry, thus fostering a sense of identity and continuity among EU member states.",
