  "summary": "Subcontracting, a pivotal concept in EU production regulations, involves a contractor delegating specific tasks to subcontractors, thereby influencing the dynamics of interdependence within supply chains. This practice can simplify invoicing processes but may also lead to complexities such as tax evasion and compliance difficulties. Subcontractors, often engaged in workshops or clothing production, are responsible for delivering services or goods as specified in subcontracts. The rationalisation of subcontracting arrangements can carry powerful implications for economies of scale, while ensuring that obligations are met. Regulatory frameworks aim to oversee these relationships, preventing untraceable transactions and ensuring that all parties adhere to scheduled invoicing and taxation requirements.",
