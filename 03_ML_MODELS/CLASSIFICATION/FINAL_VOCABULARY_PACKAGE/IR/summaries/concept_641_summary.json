  "summary": "Economies of scale refer to the cost advantages that enterprises experience as their production volume increases. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is crucial for understanding market dynamics and competition law. The EU promotes economies of scale to enhance efficiency and competitiveness among member states. By facilitating larger production capacities, businesses can reduce per-unit costs, thereby fostering innovation and consumer welfare. Regulatory bodies may assess mergers and acquisitions through the lens of economies of scale, ensuring that such consolidations do not stifle competition but rather contribute to a more efficient market structure.",
