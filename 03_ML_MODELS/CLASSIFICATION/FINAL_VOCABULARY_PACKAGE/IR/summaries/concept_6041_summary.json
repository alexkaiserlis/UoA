  "summary": "Natural food colouring refers to substances derived from natural sources, such as carotenes and beta-carotene, used to enhance the visual appeal of foodstuffs. In the EU regulatory framework, these additives must meet strict specifications and purity standards as outlined in the Codex Alimentarius and JECFA guidelines. The classification of natural colours involves analytical techniques to ensure compliance with harmonized laws and regulations. These substances are listed in various acts and codes, which aim to adapt to evolving consumer preferences while replacing synthetic alternatives. The significance of these regulations lies in their role in ensuring the safety and quality of food commodities across member states.",
