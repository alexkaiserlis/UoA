  "summary": "The \"Kaliningrad question\" pertains to the geopolitical and legal complexities surrounding the exclave of Kaliningrad, which is geographically surrounded by EU member states. This region, part of the Russian Federation, presents unique challenges in international security and regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning the Schengen area. The inhabitants of Kaliningrad face issues related to travel and trade, as the buffer zone creates a divide between Russian and EU territories. The EU aims to facilitate cooperation while addressing threats such as rabies reintroduction from wild carnivores. A roadmap for managing these challenges is essential for preserving stability and ensuring success in interchange between adjacent districts, while the region's status remains indefinitely under scrutiny.",
