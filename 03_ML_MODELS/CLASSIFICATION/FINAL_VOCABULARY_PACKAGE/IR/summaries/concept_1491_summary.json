  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"direct investment\" refers to capital flows entailed in establishing or expanding business operations in foreign domains. This concept aggregates various transactions, including the acquisition of securities and the establishment of institutional accounts. Regular reporting, as recommended by Eurostat and the ECB, ensures accuracy in the compilation of data related to these investments. The periodicity of such reporting allows for systematic calculations of income and movements, which are crucial for monitoring fluctuations in foreign investments. Protective measures are often implemented to eliminate threats to financial stability, particularly in member states like Slovakia and Malta, thereby strengthening the overall investment environment.",
