  "summary": "Underdevelopment refers to a state of economic conditions characterized by insufficient industrialization, low income levels, and inadequate infrastructure, which can hinder a region's growth potential. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, underdevelopment is often addressed through various policies aimed at fostering regional development and cohesion. The European Union implements structural funds and investment initiatives to alleviate disparities among member states, particularly in less developed areas. By promoting sustainable economic growth and enhancing competitiveness, the EU seeks to mitigate the adverse effects of underdevelopment, thereby ensuring a more balanced economic landscape across its territories.",
