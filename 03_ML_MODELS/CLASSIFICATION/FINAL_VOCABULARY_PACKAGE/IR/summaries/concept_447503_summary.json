  "summary": "The concept of \"delegation of the European Union,\" commonly referred to as \"Union delegation,\" pertains to the authority granted to EU institutions to assign specific tasks or responsibilities to other entities, including member states or external organizations. This delegation is crucial for the efficient implementation of EU policies and regulations, allowing for a more flexible and responsive governance structure. In legal and regulatory contexts, Union delegations are often outlined in treaties and legislative acts, ensuring compliance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. This mechanism enhances the EU's capacity to address diverse challenges while maintaining accountability and oversight.",
