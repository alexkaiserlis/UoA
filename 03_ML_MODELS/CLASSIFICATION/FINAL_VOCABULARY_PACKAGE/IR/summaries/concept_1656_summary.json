  "summary": "Lignite, a type of coal characterized by its low carbon content and high moisture levels, plays a significant role in the EU's coal and mining industries. As a fossil fuel, lignite is subject to various EU legal and regulatory frameworks aimed at mitigating environmental impacts, particularly in relation to greenhouse gas emissions. The EU's commitment to sustainable energy transitions influences lignite extraction and usage, prompting regulations that govern mining practices and promote cleaner alternatives. The European Green Deal and related policies seek to phase out reliance on lignite, aligning with broader climate objectives and ensuring compliance with environmental standards across member states.",
