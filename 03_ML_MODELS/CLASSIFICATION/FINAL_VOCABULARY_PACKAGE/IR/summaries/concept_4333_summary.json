  "summary": "The \"abolition of customs duties\" within the EU's 2011 tariff policy signifies a strategic move towards liberalising trade by eliminating barriers that suppress the transmission of goods. This policy accommodates preferential agreements, such as those with Zambian and Ghanaian products, fostering a consensus on trade facilitation. By instating a moratorium on certain duties, the EU aims to empower member states and associated countries like Botswana and Namibia to engage in a more competitive footing. The initiative also addresses complaints regarding the suppression of specific goods, including olives and cherries, while ensuring compliance with international frameworks like TRIPS and the Doha Development Agenda. Through extensions of these agreements, the EU seeks to create a more dynamic market, benefiting both producers and consumers across regions, including the Faroe Islands and Seychelles.",
