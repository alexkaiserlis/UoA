  "summary": "Legal science, as a branch of the law, encompasses the systematic study of legal principles, theories, and frameworks that underpin the EU's regulatory landscape. It integrates various disciplines, including jurisprudence, legal theory, and comparative law, to analyze the efficacy and coherence of legal norms within the EU. Legal science plays a crucial role in shaping legislation, guiding judicial interpretation, and informing policy-making processes. By employing rigorous methodologies, it seeks to enhance the understanding of legal systems and their interactions, thereby contributing to the development of a more integrated and effective legal order across member states.",
