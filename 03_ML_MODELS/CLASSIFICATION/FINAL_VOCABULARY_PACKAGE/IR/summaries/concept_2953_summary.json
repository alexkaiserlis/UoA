  "summary": "The \"reduction of working time\" is a significant concept within the EU's framework for the organisation of work and working conditions. It pertains to legislative measures aimed at decreasing the standard working hours, thereby enhancing work-life balance and promoting employee well-being. This reduction can be implemented through various regulatory instruments, including directives and collective agreements, which seek to adapt to evolving labour market dynamics. By fostering flexible working arrangements, the EU aims to improve productivity and job satisfaction while addressing issues such as unemployment and underemployment. The concept is integral to discussions on labour rights and social policy within the EU.",
