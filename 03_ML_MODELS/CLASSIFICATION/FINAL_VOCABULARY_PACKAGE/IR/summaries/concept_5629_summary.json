  "summary": "The \"social dimension of the internal market,\" redirected to the preferred term \"citizens' Europe,\" encapsulates the EU's commitment to integrating social considerations within its economic framework. This concept emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the internal market not only facilitates economic growth but also promotes social cohesion, equality, and the protection of citizens' rights. It seeks to balance economic freedoms with social objectives, fostering an inclusive environment where all individuals can benefit from the market's opportunities. By prioritizing the social dimension, the EU aims to create a more equitable and just society, reinforcing the notion of a citizens' Europe that values both economic and social well-being.",
