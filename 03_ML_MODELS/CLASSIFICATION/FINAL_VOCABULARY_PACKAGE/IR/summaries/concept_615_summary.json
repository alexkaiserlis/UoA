  "summary": "Subsistence farming refers to a type of agricultural practice where farmers grow food primarily for their own consumption rather than for sale in the market. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, subsistence farming is often addressed in relation to rural development policies, food security, and sustainable agriculture initiatives. The EU recognizes the importance of subsistence farming in preserving biodiversity and traditional farming methods, particularly in less economically developed regions. Regulatory measures may support these farmers through grants, training programs, and access to resources, ensuring their viability and contribution to the overall agricultural landscape within the EU.",
