  "summary": "The concept of \"world economy\" encompasses the intricate interdependencies of global markets, trade relations, and economic policies that influence the European Union's regulatory framework. In EU legal contexts, understanding the world economy is crucial for formulating policies that address economic structure, competition, and sustainability. The EU engages in international agreements to harmonize trade standards, promote economic growth, and ensure compliance with regulatory measures. This concept is pivotal for assessing the impact of external economic fluctuations on the EU's internal market and for developing strategies that enhance the Union's competitive position in the global landscape.",
