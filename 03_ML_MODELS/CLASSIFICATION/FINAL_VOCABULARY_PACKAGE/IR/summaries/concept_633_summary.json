  "summary": "Ecologism, within the EU legal and regulatory framework, refers to a political ideology that emphasizes the importance of ecological sustainability and environmental protection in policymaking. It advocates for the integration of environmental considerations into all areas of governance, promoting a holistic approach to addressing ecological challenges. This concept underpins various EU directives and regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions, enhancing biodiversity, and fostering sustainable development. By prioritizing ecologism, the EU seeks to align its legislative agenda with international environmental commitments, ensuring that economic growth does not compromise ecological integrity. Thus, ecologism serves as a foundational principle guiding EU environmental legislation.",
