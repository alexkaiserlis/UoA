  "summary": "The concept of \"private television,\" now redirected to \"private media,\" encompasses the regulatory framework governing non-publicly funded broadcasting entities within the European Union. These private media outlets operate under specific legal provisions that ensure compliance with EU directives on audiovisual media services, competition, and consumer protection. The regulatory landscape aims to foster a diverse media environment while safeguarding pluralism and freedom of expression. Private media play a crucial role in the communications sector, providing alternative viewpoints and contributing to the democratic discourse. This concept is integral to understanding the balance between commercial interests and regulatory oversight in the EU's media landscape.",
