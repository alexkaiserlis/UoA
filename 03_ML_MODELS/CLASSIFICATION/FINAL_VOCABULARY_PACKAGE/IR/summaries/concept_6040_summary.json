  "summary": "Artificial food colouring refers to synthetic additives used to enhance the visual appeal of food products within the EU regulatory framework. These colourants, such as riboflavin and carotenoid, are subject to rigorous toxicological assessments to ensure their safety and efficacy. The use of additives like titanium dioxide and brilliant blue must comply with established purity standards to prevent falsification and ensure consumer protection. Regulatory bodies review the particulars of these substances, permitting their use in specific doses while monitoring their impact on nutrition and sensory attributes. The dilution of these colourings must be carefully controlled to retain their effectiveness without hindering food quality.",
