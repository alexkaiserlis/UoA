  "summary": "Currency convertibility refers to the ability to exchange one currency for another without restrictions, a concept integral to monetary economics within the EU framework. This principle facilitates the automatic conversion of currencies, thereby enhancing trade and investment among member states, such as Austria, Sweden, and Portugal. The EU's regulatory documents outline methods for simplifying currency conversion, ensuring that values are raised in accordance with revised standards. This includes considerations for countries like Malta and Norway, which may have unique documentary requirements. By introducing a federal approach to currency convertibility, the EU aims to reduce barriers and promote economic association across its islands and regions, including Ceuta and Melilla.",
