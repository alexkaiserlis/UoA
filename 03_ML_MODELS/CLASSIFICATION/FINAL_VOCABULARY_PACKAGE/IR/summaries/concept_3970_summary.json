  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"arrest\" refers to the act of detaining suspects under legal authority, often to prevent further criminal activities such as robbery or piracy. The EU's efforts in combating piracy, particularly off the coast of Somalia, involve cooperation with international bodies like the UNSC and military operations such as Atalanta. These operations aim to suppress threats to shipping and ensure the safety of maritime flows. The strategic use of arrests serves as a deterrence mechanism, complementing broader humanitarian and security initiatives. Authorisations for such actions are critical in maintaining territorial integrity and fostering regional stability in Africa.",
