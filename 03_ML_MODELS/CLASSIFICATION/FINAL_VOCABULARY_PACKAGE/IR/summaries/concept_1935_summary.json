  "summary": "The term \"non-metallic ore\" refers to naturally occurring mineral deposits that do not contain significant amounts of metal. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, non-metallic ores are crucial for various industries, including construction and manufacturing. The extraction and processing of these ores are governed by specific regulations aimed at ensuring environmental protection and sustainable resource management. The EU's mining directives outline standards for safety, environmental impact assessments, and the responsible use of land. Understanding the classification and regulation of non-metallic ores is essential for compliance within the coal and mining industries, promoting sustainable practices across member states.",
