  "summary": "The concept of \"organisation of fishing,\" redirected to \"fisheries policy,\" encompasses the regulatory framework governing the fishing sector within the EU. This policy aims to ensure sustainable practices, balancing the breadth of fishing activities with environmental protection. It includes provisions for onboard calibration of fishing gear, segmenting species like longfinned and moroccan varieties, and establishing baselines for catch limits. Delegations from member states, such as Mauritania and Angola, participate in negotiations to enhance sectorial cooperation. The policy is modelled on scientific advice from bodies like STECF, recommending measures that outperform previous standards, ensuring the flow of resources while respecting nautical boundaries in regions like the Kattegat and Skagerrak.",
