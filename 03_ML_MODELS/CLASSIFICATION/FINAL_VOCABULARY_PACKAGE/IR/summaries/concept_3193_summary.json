  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"goods and services\" encompasses a broad spectrum of items and offerings that citizens acquire, which are essential for both individual and collective consumption. The regulation seeks to combat unfairness in market practices, ensuring that acquirers are protected against inducement and pricing disparities. It circumscribes the obligations of insurers and service providers to maintain conformance with established standards. The HICP (Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices) serves as a critical tool for monitoring price stability across various sectors, including healthcare and housing. This regulatory landscape aims to equitably address divergences in access and affordability, ultimately stimulating economic growth and safeguarding consumer rights.",
