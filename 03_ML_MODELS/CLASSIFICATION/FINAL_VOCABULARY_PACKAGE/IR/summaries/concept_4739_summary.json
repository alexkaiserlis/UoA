  "summary": "The \"rural road system,\" redirected to the preferred term \"country road,\" refers to the network of roads primarily serving rural areas within the EU. This concept is significant in the context of land transport regulations, as it encompasses the legal frameworks governing the maintenance, safety, and accessibility of these roads. Country roads play a crucial role in facilitating agricultural transport, connecting remote communities, and ensuring the mobility of rural populations. EU regulations may address funding mechanisms, environmental considerations, and safety standards pertinent to the rural road system, thereby enhancing regional development and sustainability in less urbanized areas.",
