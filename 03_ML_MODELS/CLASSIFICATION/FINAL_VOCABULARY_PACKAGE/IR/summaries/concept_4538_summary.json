  "summary": "Suburban transport refers to the organization of transport services that facilitate the movement of passengers and goods in suburban areas, typically surrounding urban centers. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, suburban transport is crucial for enhancing connectivity, reducing congestion, and promoting sustainable mobility. The European Union emphasizes the need for integrated transport systems that address the specific challenges of suburban regions, including accessibility and environmental impact. Regulatory measures aim to ensure efficient service provision, support public transport initiatives, and foster cooperation among various transport operators, thereby contributing to the overall objectives of the EU transport policy.",
