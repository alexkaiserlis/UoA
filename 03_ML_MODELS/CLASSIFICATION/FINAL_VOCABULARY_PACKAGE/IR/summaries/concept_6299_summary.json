  "summary": "Technological obsolescence, often referred to as obsolete technology, is a critical concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. It pertains to the phenomenon where technological advancements render existing technologies outdated, leading to potential compliance challenges for businesses and regulatory bodies. The EU's regulatory landscape must address the implications of obsolete technology, particularly in sectors such as telecommunications and environmental standards. This concept is pivotal for ensuring that regulations remain relevant and effective in promoting innovation while safeguarding consumer interests.
