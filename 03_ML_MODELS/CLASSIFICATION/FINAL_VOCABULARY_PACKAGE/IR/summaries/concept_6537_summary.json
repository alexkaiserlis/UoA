  "summary": "The concept of \"stepfamily\" pertains to the legal recognition of familial relationships formed through remarriage, where one or both partners have children from previous unions. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, stepfamilies may encounter specific challenges regarding custody, inheritance rights, and social benefits. The EU emphasizes the importance of family unity and the protection of children's rights, which can extend to stepfamilies. Legal instruments, such as the Brussels II bis Regulation, address jurisdictional issues in cross-border family matters, ensuring that stepfamilies are afforded appropriate legal recognition and protection within the EU's diverse legal landscapes.",
