  "summary": "The concept of \"private ECU\" refers to a monetary unit used in private transactions, distinct from public currencies issued by central banks. Within the EU's legal framework, the private ECU serves as a tool for facilitating cross-border trade and investment, allowing private entities to engage in monetary relations without direct reliance on national currencies. This concept is particularly relevant in discussions surrounding the harmonization of financial regulations and the promotion of economic integration among member states. By providing a stable alternative for private transactions, the private ECU contributes to the overall efficiency and fluidity of the internal market.",
