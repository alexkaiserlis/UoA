  "summary": "The concept of \"religious minority,\" categorized under the social framework, is redirected to the preferred term \"religious group\" within EU legal and regulatory contexts. This term encompasses communities that practice distinct religious beliefs, which may differ from the majority faith in a given member state. The EU recognizes the importance of protecting the rights of religious groups to ensure social cohesion and promote diversity. Legal frameworks, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, emphasize the significance of safeguarding the freedoms of these groups, thereby fostering an inclusive environment that respects pluralism and human rights across the Union.",
