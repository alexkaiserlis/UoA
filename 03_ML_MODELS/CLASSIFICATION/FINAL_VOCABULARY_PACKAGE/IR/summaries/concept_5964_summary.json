  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"turnover\" refers to the total revenues acquired by a business over a specific period, often influencing taxation and financial reporting. It encompasses various fees and revenues, including those from acquisitions and services provided by SMEs. The concept is crucial for determining taxable income, as it can affect presumptions regarding tax avoidance or evasion. Regulatory frameworks may opt for specific definitions to prevent artificial inflation of turnover figures. Additionally, turnover is measured against predetermined thresholds, influencing the charging of excise duties and other fees. This concept plays a vital role in institutional compliance and economic assessments.",
