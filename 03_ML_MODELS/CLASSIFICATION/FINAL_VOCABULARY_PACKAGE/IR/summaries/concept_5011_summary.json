  "summary": "The concept of \"price freeze\" refers to a regulatory measure implemented by EU authorities to stabilize prices of essential goods and services during periods of economic distress or inflation. This intervention aims to prevent excessive price increases that could adversely affect consumers and ensure market stability. Price freezes may be enacted through legislative frameworks or emergency regulations, reflecting the EU's commitment to consumer protection and economic governance. Such measures are often temporary and subject to review, ensuring that they align with broader economic policies and do not distort market competition.",
