  "summary": "The concept of \"industrial reorganisation,\" categorized under industrial structures and policy, pertains to the strategic restructuring of industrial entities within the European Union. This process is often driven by the need to enhance competitiveness, adapt to market changes, or comply with regulatory frameworks. Industrial reorganisation can involve mergers, acquisitions, or the divestiture of assets, aimed at optimizing operational efficiency. As a redirect to the preferred term \"industrial reorganisation,\" it underscores the EU's commitment to fostering a dynamic industrial landscape. Regulatory measures may be implemented to ensure that such reorganisations align with broader economic objectives and do not hinder fair competition within the internal market.",
