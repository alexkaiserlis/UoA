  "summary": "The concept of \"income stabilization,\" redirected to the preferred term \"income stabilisation,\" pertains to economic policy frameworks within the EU aimed at mitigating income volatility among individuals and sectors. This regulatory approach seeks to ensure a more predictable income flow, thereby enhancing economic resilience and social security. Income stabilisation mechanisms may include direct financial support, insurance schemes, or market interventions designed to buffer against economic shocks. By fostering stability, the EU aims to promote equitable growth and safeguard the livelihoods of its citizens, particularly in times of economic uncertainty. This concept is integral to the broader objectives of sustainable economic governance within the Union.",
