  "summary": "The concept of \"war economy\" refers to the economic structure that emerges in response to armed conflict, necessitating the mobilization of resources and adaptation of production to support military efforts. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a war economy may invoke specific measures to ensure supply chain resilience, resource allocation, and strategic planning. The EU may implement regulations to facilitate cooperation among member states, enhance defense capabilities, and manage economic impacts stemming from warfare. This concept underscores the intersection of economic policy and security, highlighting the need for robust legal mechanisms to address the challenges posed by conflict.",
