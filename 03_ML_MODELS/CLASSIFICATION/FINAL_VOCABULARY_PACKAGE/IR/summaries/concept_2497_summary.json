  "summary": "Economic policy within the EU framework encompasses a range of strategies aimed at stabilizing and synchronizing economic performance across member states. It involves various spheres, including fiscal discipline, inflationary control, and the management of indebtedness. The Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) plays a crucial role in guiding these policies, ensuring that conditionality is maintained in disbursement processes. The portfolio of economic measures often includes borrowing mechanisms, such as the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), to mitigate destabilizing outflows. By reinforcing cooperation and promoting parallelism in economic governance, the EU enhances its chances of achieving sustainable growth while addressing fragile economic conditions, particularly in member states like Portugal.",
