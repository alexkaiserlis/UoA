  "summary": "The concept of \"national farm policy,\" redirected to \"national agricultural policy,\" pertains to the frameworks established by EU member states to regulate agricultural practices and support rural development. National agricultural policies are essential for implementing the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) at the national level, ensuring compliance with EU regulations while addressing local agricultural needs. These policies encompass various measures, including subsidies, environmental sustainability initiatives, and food security strategies. By aligning national agricultural policies with EU objectives, member states contribute to a cohesive agricultural landscape, promoting competitiveness and resilience in the sector. This harmonization is crucial for achieving the EU's broader economic and environmental goals.",
