  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the concept of \"toiletries\" is redirected to the preferred term \"hygiene product.\" This shift emphasizes the classification of items designed for personal cleanliness and health maintenance, which encompasses a wide range of products. The regulation of hygiene products is crucial for ensuring consumer safety and environmental protection within the EU market. Relevant regulations, such as the Cosmetics Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, govern the formulation, labeling, and marketing of these products, ensuring compliance with safety standards and efficacy claims. Thus, \"hygiene product\" serves as a more precise term within the regulatory landscape.",
