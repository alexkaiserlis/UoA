  "summary": "The concept of \"working conditions\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks embodies the principles of decent work and fairer employment practices. It encompasses various aspects, including expatriation, secondment, and the rights of workers, particularly in sectors like seafaring and microfinance. The EU strives to ensure that working conditions do not regress into substandard practices, warranting the enjoyment of dignified labor. Regulations often articulate the responsibilities of employers, such as conducting inspections and adhering to conventions like STCW and MARPOL. Interlinked with social dialogue, these frameworks facilitate the protection of workers, especially during strikes or detaining circumstances, thereby fostering a more equitable labor environment across member states.",
