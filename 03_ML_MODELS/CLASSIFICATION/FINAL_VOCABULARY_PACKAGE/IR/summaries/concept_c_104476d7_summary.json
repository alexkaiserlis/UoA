  "summary": "The concept of \"national language\" is pivotal within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, as it pertains to the official languages used in member states for administrative, legislative, and judicial purposes. Each member state designates one or more national languages, which facilitate communication and ensure the accessibility of legal texts and regulations to citizens. The recognition of national languages is essential for upholding linguistic diversity and promoting cultural heritage within the EU. Moreover, national languages play a crucial role in the interpretation and application of EU law, ensuring that legal rights and obligations are comprehensible to all stakeholders involved in the regulatory process.",
