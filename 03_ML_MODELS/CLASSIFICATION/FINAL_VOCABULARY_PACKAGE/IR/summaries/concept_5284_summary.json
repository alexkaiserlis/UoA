Established to facilitate cooperation among member parties, it plays a crucial role in the regulatory framework governing aeroplanes and commercial operators. The ECAC's presidency oversees the implementation of policies designed to ensure compliance with safety standards and technological advancements. With an imperative focus on scrutiny and maintenance, the conference supplements the efforts of the European Union in aviation matters, addressing urgent issues such as energy efficiency and environmental impact. By consulting with international stakeholders, including the Russian Federation and Japan, the ECAC aims to foster a harmonised approach to aviation regulation, thereby enhancing the overall safety and efficiency of air transportation in Europe.",
