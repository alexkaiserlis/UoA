In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, OSS promotes transparency, collaboration, and innovation while ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. The European Union actively encourages the use of OSS in public sector projects to enhance interoperability and reduce dependency on proprietary solutions. This approach aligns with the EU's Digital Single Market strategy, fostering a competitive digital economy and supporting the principles of open access and shared knowledge within the EU member states.",
