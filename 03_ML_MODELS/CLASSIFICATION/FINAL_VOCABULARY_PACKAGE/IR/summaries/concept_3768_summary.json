  "summary": "Butane, categorized under the oil industry (6616), is a hydrocarbon gas that plays a significant role in the European Union's energy regulations. As a byproduct of natural gas processing and petroleum refining, butane is subject to various legal frameworks governing its production, distribution, and environmental impact. The EU has established directives to ensure the safe handling and use of butane, particularly in relation to energy efficiency and emissions standards. Regulatory measures also address its classification under the REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) regulation, ensuring that its use aligns with EU safety and environmental objectives.",
