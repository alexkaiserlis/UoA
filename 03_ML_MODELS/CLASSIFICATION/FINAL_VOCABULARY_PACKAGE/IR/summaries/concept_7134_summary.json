  "summary": "The term \"post-communism\" refers to the socio-economic transformations and regulatory frameworks that emerged in Eastern European countries following the dissolution of communist regimes. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, post-communism signifies a shift towards market-oriented economic structures, necessitating the establishment of legal norms that facilitate integration into the European Union. This includes the adoption of policies aimed at enhancing competition, protecting property rights, and ensuring compliance with EU standards. The post-communist transition has profound implications for economic governance, influencing legislative reforms and regulatory practices that align with the EU's overarching objectives of stability and growth.",
