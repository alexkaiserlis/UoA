  "summary": "The concept of \"terms of contract,\" redirected to the preferred term \"contract terms,\" encompasses the specific provisions and conditions that govern the rights and obligations of parties involved in a contractual agreement within the EU legal framework. These terms are crucial in civil law, as they delineate the scope of performance, liability, and remedies available in case of breach. The harmonization of contract terms across member states is essential for fostering legal certainty and protecting consumer rights, particularly under directives such as the Consumer Rights Directive. Understanding these terms is vital for compliance and effective dispute resolution in cross-border transactions.",
