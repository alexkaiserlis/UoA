  "summary": "The concept of \"audiovisual production\" encompasses the creation and distribution of audiovisual works, which are protected under intellectual property rights within the EU legal framework. This production involves performers and their performances, ensuring adequate remuneration for their contributions. The EU aims to establish a coherent regulatory environment that protects the rights of creators and neighbouring rights holders. In conjunction with international agreements, such as those negotiated at WIPO and the Geneva and Beijing conferences, the EU facilitates the signing of instruments that safeguard these rights. Consequently, audiovisual productions are eligible for exclusive rights, affecting negotiations and participation in the global market.",
