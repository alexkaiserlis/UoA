  "summary": "A \"discount store\" refers to a retail establishment that offers goods at reduced prices, primarily targeting cost-conscious consumers. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, discount stores play a significant role in the distributive trades sector, which encompasses various forms of retail and wholesale activities. These stores often operate under specific regulations concerning pricing transparency, consumer protection, and competition law. The European Union monitors discount stores to ensure compliance with directives aimed at fostering fair competition and safeguarding consumer rights, thereby contributing to a balanced and equitable market environment within the EU.",
