  "summary": "The \"death grant\" is a financial allowance provided under EU social protection regulations, aimed at supporting orphans and dependents following the death of a family member. This grant is determined by specific provisions that fix the minimum rate of support, ensuring subsistence for those affected. The relevant authorities, including registrars and commissions, are tasked with administering these grants, which may involve auditing and oversight by appointed judges. The regulations governing the death grant are subject to amendments, reflecting changes in social values and economic conditions, such as currency fluctuations and energy costs. The grant serves as a vital safety net within the EU's social protection framework.",
