  "summary": "A \"satellite town\" refers to a residential area that is situated on the outskirts of a larger urban center, designed to accommodate population overflow and alleviate urban congestion. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, satellite towns are often subject to specific construction and town planning regulations aimed at promoting sustainable development and efficient land use. These regulations may include zoning laws, environmental assessments, and infrastructure planning to ensure that satellite towns integrate effectively with the larger urban ecosystem. The development of satellite towns is crucial for addressing housing shortages and enhancing regional connectivity within the EU.",
