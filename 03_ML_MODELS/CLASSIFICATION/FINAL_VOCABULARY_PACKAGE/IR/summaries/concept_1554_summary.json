  "summary": "Jute, classified under the category of plant products, is a significant fibre utilized in various applications, including textiles and packaging. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, jute's trade is influenced by agreements negotiated during sessions of international conferences, such as those under UNCTAD and GATT. The EU's Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) presupposes a willingness to support jute-exporting countries through zero tariffs and gradual adjustments. Signatory governments must proceed with the ratified arrangements, ensuring that preferences do not expire. The institutional framework aims to facilitate the negotiation and signing of agreements that enhance jute's market access, thereby supporting sustainable development.",
