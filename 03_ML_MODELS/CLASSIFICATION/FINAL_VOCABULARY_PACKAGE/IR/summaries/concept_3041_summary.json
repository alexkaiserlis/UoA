  "summary": "The concept of \"voting age\" pertains to the legal threshold that determines the minimum age at which individuals are eligible to participate in electoral procedures within the European Union. This age is critical for ensuring the integrity of democratic processes, as it delineates the point at which citizens can exercise their voting rights. The voting age varies across EU member states, reflecting diverse national regulations and cultural contexts. Harmonization efforts within the EU aim to address disparities and promote uniformity in electoral practices, thereby enhancing democratic engagement and ensuring that younger citizens are adequately represented in decision-making processes.",
