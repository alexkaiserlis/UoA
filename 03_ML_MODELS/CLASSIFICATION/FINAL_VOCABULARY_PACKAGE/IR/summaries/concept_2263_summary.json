  "summary": "The term \"single-party system,\" a redirect to the preferred term \"one-party system,\" refers to a political framework where a single political party monopolizes political power, effectively eliminating competition. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, such systems are often scrutinized for their implications on democratic principles, human rights, and the rule of law. The European Union promotes pluralism and democratic governance, making the existence of a one-party system a significant concern. Such frameworks can hinder political diversity and citizen participation, raising questions about compliance with EU standards for democracy and governance.",
