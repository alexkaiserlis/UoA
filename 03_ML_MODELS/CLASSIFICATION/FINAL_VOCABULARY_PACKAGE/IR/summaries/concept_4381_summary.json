  "summary": "The \"common customs tariff\" is a pivotal element of the EU's tariff policy, established to regulate the importation of goods across member states. It serves as a standardized framework, ensuring that products, whether they are jeans or eucalyptol, adhere to uniform duties. This tariff system is designed to prevent market distortion, allowing for equitable trade practices. It encompasses various goods, from unperforated rubberised items to sensitized electronics, ensuring that all imports, including those with intricate crystallisation processes, are subjected to appropriate tariffs. The common customs tariff thus facilitates a cohesive market, fostering economic stability and legal clarity across the EU.",
