  "summary": "The concept of \"trading volume\" refers to the total quantity of securities or financial instruments traded within a specific timeframe, which is crucial for assessing market liquidity and investor activity. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly under the free movement of capital, trading volume serves as a key indicator of market efficiency and competitiveness. Regulatory bodies, such as the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), monitor trading volume to ensure compliance with directives aimed at fostering transparency and stability in financial markets. Understanding trading volume is essential for evaluating the impact of capital flows across member states and ensuring adherence to EU financial regulations.",
