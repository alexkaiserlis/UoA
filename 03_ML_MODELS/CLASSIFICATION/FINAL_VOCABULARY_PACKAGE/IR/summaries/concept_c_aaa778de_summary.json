  "summary": "Deindustrialisation refers to the process of declining industrial activity within a region or economy, often resulting in significant socio-economic impacts. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, deindustrialisation is addressed through various policies aimed at revitalising industrial structures and fostering sustainable economic growth. The EU recognizes the challenges posed by deindustrialisation, such as job losses and regional disparities, and implements measures to support affected areas. This concept is a redirect to \"deindustrialisation,\" which is the preferred term in EU documentation, emphasizing the need for coherent strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of industrial decline while promoting innovation and competitiveness.",
