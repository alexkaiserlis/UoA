  "summary": "Geo-blocking refers to the practice of restricting access to online content or services based on the user's geographical location. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the European Union has sought to eliminate unjustified geo-blocking to enhance the Digital Single Market. This regulation aims to facilitate cross-border access to goods and services, ensuring that consumers can engage with online platforms without facing discriminatory barriers. By addressing geo-blocking, the EU promotes fair competition and consumer rights, fostering an inclusive digital environment that supports the free movement of goods and services across member states.",
