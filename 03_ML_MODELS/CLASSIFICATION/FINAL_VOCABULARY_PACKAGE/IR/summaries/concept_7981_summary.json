  "summary": "The concept of \"parental leave allowance,\" categorized under social protection, is redirected to the preferred term \"parental allowance\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Parental allowance refers to financial support provided to parents during their leave from work to care for their newborn or newly adopted child. This allowance is designed to promote family welfare and support work-life balance, ensuring that parents can take necessary time off without financial hardship. The EU encourages member states to implement such allowances as part of broader social protection measures, thereby enhancing the well-being of families across the Union.",
