  "summary": "The concept of \"language\" within EU legal and regulatory documents encompasses the multifaceted role of linguistic diversity in the governance of the European Union. It pertains to the official languages used in legislative texts, ensuring accessibility and comprehension across member states. The EU's commitment to multilingualism reflects its cultural pluralism and enhances democratic participation. Legal instruments, such as treaties and regulations, must be drafted in all official languages, thereby facilitating equitable access to legal information. This linguistic framework is vital for the interpretation and application of EU law, promoting clarity and precision in legal discourse and ensuring that all citizens can engage with EU legislation effectively.",
