  "summary": "Isoglucose, a sweetener derived from the isomerization of glucose, plays a significant role in the EU beverage and sugar sector. Its production and use are subject to precise regulations aimed at standardising quality and ensuring consumer safety. Historically, isoglucose has been favoured for its fluidity and versatility, allowing for the creation of various products, including appelstroop and soft drinks. However, its market dynamics can disrupt traditional sugar markets, leading to surpluses and necessitating careful regulation to avoid inequalities. The EU's regulatory framework seeks to eliminate frauds and stabilize prices, while reimportation practices are monitored to prevent contravention of established standards.",
