  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"surplus stock\" refers to the excess inventory of agricultural products, such as soyabeans, oilseeds, and grains, that may arise due to overestimation of production or neglecting market demand. This surplus can lead to insecurities within the market, prompting the need for stabilising measures. Regulatory frameworks often include provisions for the proper management of surplus stocks, which may involve diverting products to charitable organizations or reimbursing producers for carryover losses. The assignment of entitlements related to surplus stock is crucial, ensuring that the management of these stocks does not void market stability or create improper market habits.",
