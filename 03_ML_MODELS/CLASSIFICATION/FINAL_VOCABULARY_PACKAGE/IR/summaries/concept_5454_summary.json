  "summary": "The \"Republic of Azerbaijan,\" redirecting to the preferred term \"Azerbaijan,\" is significant in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning political geography and mobility. Azerbaijan's strategic position enhances its role in regional summits, facilitating relations with neighboring countries like Iran, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan. The EU's engagement includes endorsing agreements on visa liberalisation and readmission, addressing deficiencies in travel regulations. The issuance of visas for seafarers under the STCW convention exemplifies Azerbaijan's commitment to international maritime standards. Furthermore, the EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) supports Azerbaijan's economic integration, demonstrating reciprocity in trade relations and fostering institutional cooperation.",
