  "summary": "International human rights law encompasses a framework aimed at prosecuting perpetrators of crimes against humanity, including genocide and war crimes. The EU actively engages in enhancing this legal structure through ratified treaties and resolutions that empower jurisdictions to confront violations and ensure accountability. Notably, the establishment of specialized tribunals, such as the ICTY for the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and tribunals addressing the Rwandan genocide, emphasizes the necessity of prosecuting indictees to avoid impunity for unpunished acts. The EU's commitment to restoring peace and justice is reflected in its dealings with international bodies, seeking to intensify the investigation of flagrant human rights violations and providing refuge for victims.",
