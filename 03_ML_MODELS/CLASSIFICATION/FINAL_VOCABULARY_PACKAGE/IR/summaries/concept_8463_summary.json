  "summary": "The term \"no frills carrier\" refers to a \"low cost airline,\" which operates under a business model characterized by minimal services and lower fares compared to traditional airlines. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, low cost airlines are subject to specific regulations concerning consumer protection, safety standards, and competition law. The European Union has established guidelines to ensure fair competition among carriers, including transparency in pricing and the provision of essential passenger rights. This regulatory oversight aims to foster a competitive air transport market while safeguarding consumer interests, thereby enhancing accessibility to air travel across member states.",
