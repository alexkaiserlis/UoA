  "summary": "The concept of \"relations between the two German States\" pertains to the historical and legal framework governing interactions between East Germany (German Democratic Republic) and West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany) prior to reunification in 1990. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, this concept is significant for understanding the evolution of international affairs within Europe, particularly regarding issues of sovereignty, diplomatic recognition, and the impact of the Cold War on European integration. The regulatory implications of these relations have shaped EU policies on member state cooperation and the harmonization of legal standards post-reunification, reflecting the broader dynamics of European unity and stability.",
