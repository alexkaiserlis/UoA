  "summary": "Public economic law encompasses the legal frameworks governing the relationship between public authorities and economic entities within the European Union. This branch of law regulates the exercise of executive power in economic matters, ensuring compliance with principles such as transparency, accountability, and non-discrimination. It plays a crucial role in the establishment of public service obligations and the management of state aid, thereby influencing market dynamics and promoting fair competition. By delineating the boundaries of public intervention in the economy, public economic law aims to balance public interests with private sector autonomy, fostering sustainable economic development across EU member states.",
