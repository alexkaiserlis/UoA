  "summary": "Insurance indemnity refers to the obligation of an insurer to compensate the insured for losses incurred due to specified risks, as delineated in an insurance contract. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, insurance indemnity is governed by directives that ensure consumer protection and the solvency of insurance providers. These regulations mandate that indemnity payments are made promptly and fairly, reflecting the principle of good faith in contractual relationships. The concept is vital for maintaining trust in the insurance market and ensuring that policyholders receive adequate compensation for their losses, thereby promoting financial stability within the EU.",
