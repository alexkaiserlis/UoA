  "summary": "The concept of \"placed under guardianship\" refers to a legal status wherein an individual, typically a minor or a person unable to care for themselves, is assigned a guardian to oversee their welfare and rights. In EU legal and regulatory contexts, guardianship is crucial for protecting vulnerable populations, ensuring their interests are represented, and facilitating their integration into society. This term is a redirect to the preferred term \"guardianship,\" which encompasses the broader legal framework governing such arrangements across member states. The regulation of guardianship varies, reflecting diverse national laws while striving for harmonization within the EU's legal landscape.",
