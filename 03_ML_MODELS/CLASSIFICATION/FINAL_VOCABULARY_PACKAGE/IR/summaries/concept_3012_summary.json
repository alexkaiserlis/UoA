  "summary": "The concept of \"commercial television,\" redirected to \"commercial media,\" pertains to the provision of audiovisual content primarily for profit within the EU's regulatory framework. This encompasses various forms of broadcasting that are funded through advertising and sponsorship, distinguishing them from public service media. The EU legal landscape, particularly through directives such as the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD), establishes standards for content regulation, advertising limits, and consumer protection. By delineating commercial media from other media types, the EU aims to foster a competitive market while ensuring compliance with cultural and ethical standards, thereby enhancing media pluralism and diversity across member states.",
