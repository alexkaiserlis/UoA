  "summary": "The International Court of Justice (ICJ) serves as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, adjudicating disputes between states and providing advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by UN bodies. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the ICJ plays a pivotal role in interpreting international law, which can influence EU legislation and member states' compliance with international obligations. The Court's decisions contribute to the development of customary international law, thereby shaping the legal landscape within which the EU operates. Its rulings may also impact the EU's external relations and its approach to human rights, trade, and environmental law.",
