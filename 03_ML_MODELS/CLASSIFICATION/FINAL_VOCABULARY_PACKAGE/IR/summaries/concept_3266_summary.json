  "summary": "The term \"bracket rate\" within the context of EU transport policy refers to a regulatory framework that establishes a range of permissible rates or charges applicable to transport services. This concept is crucial for ensuring fair competition and transparency in the transport sector, particularly in the context of public procurement and service concessions. By setting bracket rates, the EU aims to prevent price discrimination and promote equitable access to transport services across member states. The implementation of bracket rates is often linked to broader regulatory measures aimed at harmonizing transport policies and enhancing market efficiency within the EU's internal market.",
