  "summary": "Governance within the EU legal and regulatory framework encompasses the structures and processes that oversee public service and executive power. It incorporates principles of accountability and predictability, ensuring that stakeholders can trust in the integrity of governance mechanisms. The EU's governance model often involves the endorsement of international agreements, such as those related to FLEGT (Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade) and the Cotonou Agreement, which aim to combat corruption and illicit activities like logging and drug trafficking. By analysing the roles of various actors, including academia and civil society, the EU seeks to enhance governance effectiveness, thereby fostering a plurinational approach that respects the rights of all member states, including those like Guinea and Bolivia, which may face unique challenges.",
