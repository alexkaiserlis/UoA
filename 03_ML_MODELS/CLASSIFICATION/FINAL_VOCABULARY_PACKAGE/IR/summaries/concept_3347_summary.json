  "summary": "The concept of \"prevention of delinquency\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks focuses on combatting juvenile offences and promoting social liberties. Initiatives like the European Crime Prevention Network (EUCPN) aim to bridge gaps in preparedness and engagement among member states. Campaigning efforts are crucial for disseminating information on effective strategies, including the use of DNA and fingerprint databases such as Eurodac and Prüm. The Tampere Programme emphasizes partnerships to address insufficiently tackled issues, including drug-related offences and terrorism. By fostering a focal approach, the EU seeks to establish consequential measures that ensure the safety and well-being of its citizens, particularly in regions like Burkina Faso and Guinea-Bissau.",
