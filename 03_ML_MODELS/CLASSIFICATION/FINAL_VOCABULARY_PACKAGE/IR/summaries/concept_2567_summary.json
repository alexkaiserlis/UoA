  "summary": "The concept of \"conventional weapon\" encompasses a broad range of arms, including explosives and landmines, which are subject to international regulations. The EU acknowledges the need for multilateralism in addressing the challenges posed by these weapons, particularly through frameworks like the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) and initiatives for demining. The European Union actively participates in governmental efforts to ratify agreements that complement existing regulations, ensuring inclusiveness in the disarmament process. Today, the EU convenes seminars and outreach programs to equip specialists with knowledge on the implementation of these treaties, addressing the urgent need to protect victims and prevent the diversion of arms.",
