  "summary": "The concept of \"political status\" pertains to the legal and regulatory frameworks governing the recognition and treatment of entities within international security contexts. In EU legal documents, political status can influence diplomatic relations, territorial integrity, and the application of international law. It encompasses issues such as statehood, sovereignty, and the rights of self-determination, which are pivotal in conflict resolution and peacekeeping operations. Understanding political status is essential for EU institutions when formulating policies that address security challenges, as it directly affects the legitimacy of actions taken within the international arena and the EU's role in promoting stability and cooperation among member states and third countries.",
