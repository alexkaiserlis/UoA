  "summary": "A \"free zone\" within the EU tariff policy framework refers to designated areas where goods can be stored, processed, or manufactured without being subject to the usual customs duties and regulations. This reglementation aims to boost economic activity by diversifying trade and facilitating quicker exportable goods. Within these zones, warehousing practices allow for the mixing of products, such as plastics and sugars, without immediate tariff implications. However, discrepancies in admittance criteria can pose a handicap to businesses, particularly in outlying regions or archipelagos. The relaxation of certain regulations encourages investment and supports the homogeneity of trade practices across member states, ultimately enhancing competitiveness and reducing detriment to local economies.",
