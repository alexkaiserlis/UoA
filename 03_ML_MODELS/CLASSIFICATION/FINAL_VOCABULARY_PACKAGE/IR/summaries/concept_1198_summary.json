  "summary": "The \"human rights movement\" encompasses a broad spectrum of advocacy aimed at promoting and protecting fundamental rights and freedoms within the European Union. This movement is integral to EU legal frameworks, which prioritize the safeguarding of human dignity, equality, and non-discrimination. Regulatory documents, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, codify these principles, ensuring that member states uphold human rights standards. The movement also influences EU policies and legislation, fostering a culture of accountability and justice. By addressing violations and advocating for marginalized groups, the human rights movement plays a crucial role in shaping a more equitable society across Europe.",
