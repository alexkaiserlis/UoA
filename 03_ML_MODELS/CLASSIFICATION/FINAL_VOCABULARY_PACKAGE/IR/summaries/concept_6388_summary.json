  "summary": "Human geography, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the study of spatial relationships and human activities as they relate to the environment. This discipline is crucial for understanding demographic trends, urban planning, and regional development, which are often addressed in EU policies. The integration of human geography into regulatory documents facilitates informed decision-making regarding land use, resource management, and sustainable development. By analyzing human-environment interactions, EU institutions can better formulate regulations that promote social cohesion, economic growth, and environmental protection, thereby ensuring compliance with overarching EU objectives and treaties.",
