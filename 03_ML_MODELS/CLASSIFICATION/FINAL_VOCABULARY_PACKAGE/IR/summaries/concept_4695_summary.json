  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"victim\" refers to individuals who have suffered harm due to crime, including trafficking and other forms of violence. The EU is committed to protecting victims' rights, facilitating access to justice, and ensuring compensation for their suffering. Various legal instruments, such as protocols and directives, aim to standardize the treatment of victims across member states, promoting cooperation in cross-border cases. The intention is to replace outdated practices with authentic measures that enhance security and support for victims. This includes consulting on applications for residence and providing necessary support in combating crime effectively.",
