  "summary": "Corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the EU context serves as a multidimensional framework guiding businesses, particularly multinational corporations, to operate in an accountable manner. It emphasizes the importance of due diligence in supply chains, encouraging companies to disclose their practices and outcomes related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. The EU promotes CSR as a roadmap for fostering relationships among diverse stakeholders, including investors and employees, while combating corruption and bribery. By materialising CSR principles, firms can constructively engage in internationalisation efforts, aligning with G20 commitments. This phenomenon not only boosts corporate reputation but also rewards ethical behaviour across various backgrounds, ensuring a sustainable future.",
