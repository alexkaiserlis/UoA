  "summary": "The concept of \"freedom of religious worship,\" redirected to \"freedom of religious beliefs,\" is a fundamental right enshrined in EU legal frameworks, particularly within the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This principle safeguards individuals' rights to practice, change, or abstain from religion without coercion. It underscores the EU's commitment to pluralism and tolerance, ensuring that diverse beliefs coexist within member states. The legal protection of this freedom is crucial for maintaining democratic values and human dignity, fostering an environment where all citizens can express their spiritual convictions freely and openly, thereby enhancing societal cohesion and mutual respect.",
