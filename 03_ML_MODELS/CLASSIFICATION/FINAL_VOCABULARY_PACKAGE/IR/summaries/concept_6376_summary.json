  "summary": "Ethnic cleansing refers to the systematic and deliberate removal of an ethnic or religious group from a particular territory, often through violence, intimidation, or forced displacement. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, it is recognized as a grave violation of international law and human rights. The EU actively engages in measures to prevent ethnic cleansing, including sanctions, diplomatic interventions, and support for international justice mechanisms. The concept is integral to discussions on international security, humanitarian intervention, and the protection of vulnerable populations, reflecting the EU's commitment to uphold fundamental rights and promote peace in conflict-affected regions.",
