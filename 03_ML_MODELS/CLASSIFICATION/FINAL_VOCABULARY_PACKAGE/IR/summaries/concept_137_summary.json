  "summary": "The \"rescheduling of public debt\" refers to the legal and regulatory mechanisms employed by EU member states to modify the terms of their existing public debt obligations. This process may involve extending repayment periods, reducing interest rates, or altering payment schedules to enhance fiscal sustainability and mitigate financial distress. In the context of EU public finance and budget policy, rescheduling can be a critical tool for maintaining compliance with fiscal rules established under the Stability and Growth Pact. It aims to ensure that member states can manage their debt levels effectively while promoting economic stability and growth within the EU framework.",
