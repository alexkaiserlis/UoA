  "summary": "The \"termination of a contract\" in EU civil law refers to the legal process by which contractual obligations are cancelled or ended before their stipulated expiration. This can occur under various conditions, such as non-performance or mutual agreement. In the context of economic communities, regulations may lay down necessary measures for the management of contracts, particularly in sectors like agriculture, where the marketing of crops, such as wine, is regulated. Consequently, organizations must adhere to articles establishing conditions for early termination. This ensures compliance with community standards and provides a relatively open framework for addressing contract disputes, particularly in sectors affected by market fluctuations.",
