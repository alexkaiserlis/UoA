  "summary": "The concept of \"persecution\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the systematic mistreatment of individuals based on their identity, beliefs, or affiliations. It is a critical aspect of the rights and freedoms category, emphasizing the protection of individuals from such violations. The EU's legal instruments, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Common European Asylum System, address persecution by establishing criteria for asylum seekers and refugees. These frameworks ensure that individuals fleeing persecution can seek protection, thereby reinforcing the EU's commitment to human rights and the rule of law.",
