  "summary": "The concept of \"quote\" within EU legal and regulatory documentation refers to the formal citation of texts, provisions, or statements that are pertinent to legal arguments or regulatory frameworks. In the context of EU law, accurate quoting is essential for ensuring clarity and precision in legal discourse, facilitating the interpretation of legislative texts, and supporting compliance with regulatory obligations. Quotes serve as authoritative references that bolster legal reasoning and enhance the credibility of documents. The meticulous use of quotes is vital in drafting legislative proposals, legal opinions, and official communications, ensuring that the integrity of the original source is maintained throughout the documentation process.",
