  "summary": "The \"right of occupancy\" pertains to housing law within the EU framework, emphasizing the legal entitlement of individuals to reside in a property. This concept is crucial in construction and town planning, as it governs the conditions under which housing can be occupied. The right of occupancy ensures that residents have legal protections against unlawful eviction and establishes standards for housing quality and accessibility. As a redirect to \"housing law,\" it underscores the broader regulatory context that encompasses various rights and obligations related to residential properties, thereby facilitating compliance with EU directives aimed at promoting sustainable urban development and social inclusion.",
