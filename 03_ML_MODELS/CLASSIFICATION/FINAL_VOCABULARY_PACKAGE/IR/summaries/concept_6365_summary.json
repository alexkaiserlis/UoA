  "summary": "A \"service concession\" refers to a legal arrangement where a public authority grants a private entity the right to operate a service, typically involving infrastructure or public utilities, for a specified period. In the context of EU trade policy, service concessions are governed by specific regulatory frameworks that ensure transparency, competition, and fair access to public services. These concessions may involve the private operator bearing significant operational risks while providing services to the public. The EU aims to harmonize the rules surrounding service concessions to facilitate cross-border investments and enhance service delivery across member states, promoting economic growth and efficiency.",
