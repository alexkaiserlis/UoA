  "summary": "The \"second stage of EMU\" marks a significant evolution in the European Union's monetary integration, aimed at unifying economic policies among member states. This stage, formulated to cope with widening deficits and debt levels, necessitates that countries adhere to strict criteria, including a projected gross debt-to-GDP ratio. As institutional frameworks were established, earlier observations suggested that member states would face challenges in managing their fiscal policies. The abrogation of previous monetary arrangements led to a sharper focus on collective stability. Consequently, the legal definitions of deficits and borrowing were markedly refined, ensuring that compliance is warranted to avoid excessive imbalances.",
