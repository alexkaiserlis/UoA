  "summary": "The concept of \"multilingual television broadcast,\" redirected to \"European television,\" pertains to the regulatory framework governing the dissemination of audiovisual content across the European Union. This framework aims to promote cultural diversity and linguistic plurality, ensuring that broadcasts are accessible in multiple languages to cater to diverse audiences. The EU's legal instruments, such as the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD), establish standards for content regulation, advertising, and the protection of minors. By facilitating multilingual broadcasts, the EU enhances cross-border communication and fosters a shared European identity, aligning with its broader objectives of integration and cultural exchange.",
