  "summary": "The \"national budget\" refers to the financial plan of a member state within the European Union, detailing expected revenues and expenditures for a specific fiscal year. It is a crucial instrument of public finance and budget policy, reflecting the state's economic priorities and obligations. In the EU context, national budgets must align with overarching fiscal rules established by the Stability and Growth Pact, ensuring that member states maintain sound public finances. This alignment is essential for fostering economic stability and growth across the Union, facilitating compliance with EU regulations while allowing for national discretion in budgetary matters.",
