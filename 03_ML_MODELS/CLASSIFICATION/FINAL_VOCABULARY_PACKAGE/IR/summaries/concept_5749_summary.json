  "summary": "The \"negotiation of an agreement (EU)\" encompasses the processes through which the European Union engages in discussions to establish or amend treaties and accords with foreign entities, including states like Monaco and Andorra. This involves initialling drafts, defining modalities, and ensuring compliance with existing regulations. The negotiation may lead to ratification, whereby the agreement is formally endorsed and enters into force, subject to conditions such as the fulfilment of specific obligations. Key aspects include the negotiation of taxation regimes, monetary policies, and the issuance of coins, which are crucial for economic relations. The process is overseen by ambassadors and may involve renegotiation to adjust terms, ensuring that the agreement aligns with EU competencies and objectives.",
