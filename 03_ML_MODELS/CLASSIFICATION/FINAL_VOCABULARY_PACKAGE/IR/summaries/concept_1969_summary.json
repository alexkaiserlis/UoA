  "summary": "The concept of \"money\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses various forms of currency, including banknotes and coins, which are essential for economic transactions. The minting of currency involves meticulous design processes, where designers create recognisable features to prevent counterfeits. Commemorative issuances celebrate significant events, while tactile elements aid the visually impaired in identifying denominations. Regulatory measures ensure that mutilated or coarse currency is properly handled, and the issuance of coupons, such as those used in vending machines and casinos, is strictly controlled. The EU also addresses issues related to floating currencies and the authentication of banknotes, ensuring a stable monetary environment.",
