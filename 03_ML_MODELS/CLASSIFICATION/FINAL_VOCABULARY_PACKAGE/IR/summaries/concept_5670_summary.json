  "summary": "Diplomatic law, primarily encapsulated by the concept of diplomatic immunity, governs the privileges and protections afforded to diplomats and their missions under international law. Within the EU context, this legal framework ensures that diplomats can perform their duties without interference from host states, thereby facilitating international relations and cooperation. Diplomatic immunity encompasses various aspects, including inviolability of diplomatic premises and exemption from certain legal processes. As a redirect to \"diplomatic immunity,\" this concept underscores the importance of safeguarding diplomatic agents to maintain effective communication and negotiation between EU member states and third countries, reinforcing the EU's commitment to international diplomacy.",
