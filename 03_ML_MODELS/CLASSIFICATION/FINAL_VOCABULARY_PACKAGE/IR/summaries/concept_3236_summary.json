  "summary": "Transfer pricing refers to the pricing of goods, services, and intangibles between related corporate entities, particularly in cross-border transactions. Within the EU's regulatory framework, it addresses fiscal issues and taxation obstacles that may arise from differing national tax laws. The European Commission, through its directorate, advises member states on the advisability of implementing consolidated transfer pricing rules to ensure balanced taxation and prevent profit shifting. This concept is crucial for maintaining free movement of capital and fostering a competitive market. Experts in the field are often appointed to assist in discussions, ensuring transparency and appropriate disclosure of pricing practices.",
