  "summary": "The concept of \"political power\" within the EU legal framework refers to the authority exercised by institutions and actors in shaping policies, governance, and regulatory measures. It encompasses the mechanisms through which decisions are made, including legislative, executive, and judicial functions. Political power is fundamental to the functioning of the EU, as it determines the balance between member states and EU institutions. This concept is pivotal in understanding the dynamics of EU law, where political power influences the creation, implementation, and enforcement of regulations. The interplay of political power among various stakeholders is essential for maintaining democratic legitimacy and accountability within the Union.",
