  "summary": "The \"cost of pollution\" refers to the economic valuation of environmental degradation caused by pollutants, which is a critical consideration in EU environmental policy. This concept underpins various regulatory frameworks aimed at internalizing externalities associated with pollution. By quantifying the cost of pollution, the EU seeks to promote sustainable practices and compliance with environmental standards. It informs legislation such as the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and pollution control measures, ensuring that polluters bear the financial responsibility for their environmental impact. Ultimately, addressing the cost of pollution is essential for achieving the EU's climate goals and fostering a circular economy.",
