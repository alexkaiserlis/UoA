  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"services company\" pertains to entities that provide various services, often liberalised under EU directives. These companies are crucial for enhancing economic capability and ensuring compliance with standards across sectors, including transport and heating. They operate within a framework that safeguards consumer interests and promotes fair competition. The classification of services companies, often aligned with ISIC codes, narrows the focus on specific branches, ensuring that qualifications and capabilities are objectively assessed. In pursuing contracts, these companies may rely on bids that are commensurate with their revenues and the appropriateness of their services, thereby enhancing their competitive path in the market.",
