  "summary": "The concept of \"shore protection,\" redirected to \"coastal protection,\" is integral to EU environmental policy, particularly in safeguarding coastal ecosystems from erosion and degradation. Coastal protection measures are essential for maintaining biodiversity, ensuring sustainable development, and mitigating the impacts of climate change. EU regulations mandate member states to implement effective coastal management strategies, which include the construction of barriers, restoration of natural habitats, and the promotion of integrated coastal zone management. These initiatives are crucial for preserving the ecological balance and enhancing resilience against natural hazards, thereby aligning with broader EU environmental objectives and commitments.",
