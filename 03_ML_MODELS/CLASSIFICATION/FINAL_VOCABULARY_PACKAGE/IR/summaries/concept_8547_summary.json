  "summary": "Saint Barthélemy, an overseas collectivity of France, is classified under the EU's framework of overseas countries and territories (OCTs). This island has a unique status that allows it to retain certain competencies, particularly in taxation and economic relations, despite being geographically distant from the EU. The TFEU provisions facilitate negotiations aimed at enhancing cooperation and programming between Saint Barthélemy and EU institutions. Issues such as tax evasion and fraud are critical in this context, prompting mechanisms to combat these challenges. The currency used is the euro, which underscores the island's integration into the EU's monetary framework, while also preserving its distinct identity.",
