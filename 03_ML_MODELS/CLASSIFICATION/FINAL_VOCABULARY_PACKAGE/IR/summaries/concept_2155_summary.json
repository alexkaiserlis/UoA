  "summary": "The concept of \"political opposition\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to entities and groups that challenge or contest the governing bodies and policies. This opposition is crucial for democratic processes, as it ensures diverse perspectives are considered in decision-making. Events involving political opposition can lead to tragic outcomes, such as protests resulting in deaths or government crackdowns. The EU often engages in partnerships to support political opposition in third countries, as seen in treaties and conventions that impose restrictive measures against oppressive regimes. Provisions for funding and resources are established to support these groups, ensuring their voices are heard in the political arena.",
