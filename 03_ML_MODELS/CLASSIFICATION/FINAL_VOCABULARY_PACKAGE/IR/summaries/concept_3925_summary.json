  "summary": "The concept of \"information science\" encompasses the systematic study of information processes, including the creation, dissemination, and utilization of information within various contexts. In the realm of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, information science plays a pivotal role in ensuring transparency, accessibility, and the effective management of data. It underpins the development of regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Digital Services Act, which aim to safeguard individuals' rights while promoting the responsible use of information. By integrating principles of information science, EU institutions can enhance their regulatory mechanisms and improve compliance with legal standards across member states.",
