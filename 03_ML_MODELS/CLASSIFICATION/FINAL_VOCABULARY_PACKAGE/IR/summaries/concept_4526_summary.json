  "summary": "The concept of \"national transport\" pertains to the organization of transport within EU member states, addressing various regulatory frameworks. It encompasses the use of tachographs to monitor drivers' hours and ensure compliance with safety standards. National transport regulations safeguard worker rights and establish equivalencies for cross-border haulage operations. The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) plays a role in ensuring that liferafts and other apparatus meet safety requirements for voyages across seas. Additionally, regulations address the reception of passenger transport and the rationalization of distances traveled, ensuring minimal disruption during adverse weather conditions. The concept also explores alternatives for specialized occupations and the implications of flag states on transport operations.",
