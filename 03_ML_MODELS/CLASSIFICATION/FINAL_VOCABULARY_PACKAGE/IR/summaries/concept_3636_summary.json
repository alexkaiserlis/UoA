  "summary": "The concept of \"new technology\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses innovations that blur traditional boundaries and challenge existing principles. It is essential for enhancing operability and enriching various sectors, including academia and healthcare. The EU aims to leverage new technologies to address aspirations in sustainability and efficiency, particularly in areas like aeronautics (SESAR) and environmental management (aerosols). Regulatory frameworks must remain agile to adapt to rapid advancements, ensuring timely responses to emerging challenges. Demonstrations of new technologies in settings such as Eurotecnet and COMETT highlight their potential to transform industries, while also addressing concerns like IPR and consumer safety.",
