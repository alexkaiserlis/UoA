  "summary": "Copyright, a fundamental aspect of research and intellectual property within the EU, harmonizes the protection of creations across member states. It grants authorship rights to rightholders, including composers, lyricists, and arrangers, ensuring that their works, such as phonographic fixations and dramatical compositions, are safeguarded against infringers and pirates. The EU's regulatory framework, influenced by treaties like the WCT and WPPT, aims to rebalance interests between creators and users. This includes provisions for pseudonymous works and moral rights, which curtail objectionable uses. Additionally, the involvement of lobbies like IMRO and GESAC highlights the ongoing discourse surrounding copyright's aesthetic and economic implications, as well as the need to address disincentives for creators in various genres, including jazz and homestyle music.",
