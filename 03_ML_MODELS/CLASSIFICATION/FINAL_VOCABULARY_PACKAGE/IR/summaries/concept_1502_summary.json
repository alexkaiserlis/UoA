  "summary": "\"Irian Jaya,\" located in the western part of New Guinea, is significant in the context of economic geography, particularly within EU legal and regulatory frameworks that address regional development and resource management. While not a direct focus of EU legislation, its economic landscape may influence discussions on trade agreements, environmental regulations, and sustainable development initiatives. The region's unique geographical attributes necessitate careful consideration in EU policies that aim to foster economic cooperation and sustainable practices in areas with rich biodiversity. Understanding Irian Jaya's economic geography can inform EU strategies for international partnerships and environmental stewardship.",
