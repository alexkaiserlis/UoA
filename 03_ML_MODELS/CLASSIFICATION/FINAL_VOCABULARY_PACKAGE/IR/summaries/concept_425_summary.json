  "summary": "The term \"upper chamber,\" a redirect to \"Upper House,\" refers to the legislative body in a bicameral parliament, which plays a crucial role in the EU's regulatory framework. The Upper House typically reviews and amends legislation proposed by the lower chamber, ensuring a comprehensive examination of policies affecting member states. This chamber often represents regional interests and provides a platform for deliberation on significant legal matters. In the context of EU governance, the Upper House contributes to the balance of power within the legislative process, facilitating democratic oversight and enhancing the legitimacy of EU law through its deliberative functions.",
