  "summary": "The concept of \"seawater,\" categorized under the natural environment, is redirected to the preferred term \"saltwater\" in EU legal and regulatory contexts. Saltwater is essential for various environmental regulations, particularly those concerning marine biodiversity, pollution control, and sustainable fisheries management. The EU's legal frameworks, such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, emphasize the protection and sustainable use of saltwater ecosystems. Understanding the implications of saltwater is crucial for compliance with environmental standards and for the preservation of marine resources, which are vital for ecological balance and economic activities within EU member states.",
