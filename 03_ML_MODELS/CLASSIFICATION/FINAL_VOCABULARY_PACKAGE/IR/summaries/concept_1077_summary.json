  "summary": "The term \"open hearth furnace,\" classified under mechanical engineering, is redirected to the preferred term \"furnace.\" This concept encompasses various appliances utilized for heating processes, including those in industrial and household contexts. In EU regulatory frameworks, the classification of furnaces is crucial for investigating compliance with standardized safety and environmental regulations. The origins of these appliances can differ significantly, prompting inquiries into their liability regarding emissions and energy consumption. Complaints regarding dumped products from countries like Japan and Korea have initiated proceedings aimed at terminating unfair trade practices. Accurate responses to questionnaires from member states are essential for verifying compliance and understanding the profound implications of these regulations on market dynamics.",
