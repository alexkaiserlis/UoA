  "summary": "The term \"political militant\" refers to individuals or groups actively engaged in political activities that may involve the use of force or extreme measures to achieve political objectives. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, political militants often intersect with discussions on political parties, particularly those that may espouse radical ideologies or engage in unlawful activities. The EU monitors such entities to ensure compliance with democratic principles and the rule of law. Understanding the implications of political militancy is crucial for maintaining political stability and safeguarding democratic institutions within member states, thereby reinforcing the EU's commitment to upholding human rights and democratic governance.",
