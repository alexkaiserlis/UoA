  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"spring water,\" a term redirected to \"freshwater,\" encompasses various hydrogeological formations that yield naturally occurring water. Regulatory frameworks assess the physico-chemical characteristics of spring water, ensuring it meets safety standards for drinking. Appraisals of water quality focus on constituents such as nitrates, arsenic, and fluoride, which can pose health risks, particularly to infants. The presence of undesirable concentrations of minerals like barium and manganese necessitates treatments to ensure compliance with the Codex Alimentarius. Variability in spring water composition can generate uncertainties regarding its beneficial properties, thus prompting the need for validated monitoring stations to ensure safe intake levels.",
