  "summary": "The term \"former socialist countries\" refers to nations that transitioned from socialist governance to market-oriented economies, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these countries have undergone significant political and economic reforms to align with EU standards, facilitating their accession to the Union. This transformation often involves the adoption of EU legislation, compliance with regulatory norms, and participation in political geography discussions that shape regional stability and integration. Understanding the status and evolution of these countries is crucial for assessing EU policies and cooperative initiatives.",
