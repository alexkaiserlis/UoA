  "summary": "Legislative harmonisation, also known as the approximation of laws, is a fundamental EU legal concept aimed at reducing divergencies among member statesâ€™ regulations. This process inspires lawmakers to create a cohesive legal framework that facilitates the free movement of goods and services, ensuring that products, such as thermoplastic materials or childresistant packaging, meet common standards. It addresses issues like the transferors of hazardous substances, including trichloroethylene and thiabendazol, by establishing uniform rules for their use. By promoting practical rulemaking, legislative harmonisation enhances market efficiency, reduces compliance costs, and fosters innovation, ultimately benefiting consumers and industries alike without compromising safety or health standards.",
