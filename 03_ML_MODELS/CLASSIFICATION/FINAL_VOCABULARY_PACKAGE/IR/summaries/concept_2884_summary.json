  "summary": "Radiation protection within the EU legal framework encompasses regulations aimed at safeguarding individuals and the environment from the dangers of ionizing radiation. This includes the management of radionuclides and the oversight of nuclear reactors, ensuring that the proliferation of radioactive materials is controlled. The EU prescribes standards for radiation doses in medical therapy, emphasizing the importance of diagnostic accuracy while minimizing hazards to patients. Legal documents often reference the need for colorimetric and photometric methods to monitor exposure levels. Scientists are tasked with observing and reporting on the effects of radiation, particularly in light of historical events like Chernobyl, to promote harmony in public health and safety.",
