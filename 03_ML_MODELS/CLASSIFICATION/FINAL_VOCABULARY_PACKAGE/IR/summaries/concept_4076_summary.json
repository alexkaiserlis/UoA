  "summary": "The concept of \"toxic risk,\" redirected to \"industrial hazard,\" is pivotal in EU environmental policy, addressing the propensity for harmful substances, such as bromine and methanol, to cause adverse effects. Regulatory frameworks aim to streamline the management of these risks across various subsectors, including construction materials like bricks, tiles, and roofing coverings. The interpretative guidelines emphasize the need for spatial planning to mitigate leakage and ignition risks associated with industrial processes. By maximizing safety through disaggregation of hazardous materials, such as slag and chopped wools, the EU seeks to protect beings and the environment from potential hazards, ensuring compliance with established standards.",
