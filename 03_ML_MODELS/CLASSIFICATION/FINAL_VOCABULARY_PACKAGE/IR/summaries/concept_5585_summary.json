It serves as a levers for greening initiatives, promoting practices that decarbonise industries and enhance ecological resilience. The EU's commitment to sustainable development is evident in its internationalisation efforts, such as the G20 covenants and FLEGT regulations, which aim to combat bribery and ensure responsible sourcing of bioliquids. By fostering crossborder cooperation and anticipatory governance, the EU seeks to replenish natural sinks and address urbanism challenges, while constructively engaging with diverse backgrounds, including plurinational contexts like Bolivia.
