  "summary": "The concept of \"international competition\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to the dynamics of market competition that transcends national borders. It encompasses the regulatory measures and policies aimed at ensuring fair competition among businesses operating in the European Single Market and beyond. The EU's competition law, primarily articulated in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), seeks to prevent anti-competitive practices that could distort international trade and harm consumer welfare. This concept is crucial for maintaining a level playing field, promoting innovation, and enhancing consumer choice in an increasingly globalized economy.",
