  "summary": "Fuel reprocessing refers to the technological processes involved in the treatment of spent nuclear fuel, aimed at recovering usable materials, such as plutonium and uranium, while minimizing radioactive waste. Within the EU regulatory framework, fuel reprocessing is governed by stringent safety and environmental standards to ensure the protection of public health and the environment. The European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) establishes guidelines for the management of nuclear materials, including licensing and oversight of reprocessing facilities. This regulatory oversight is critical in promoting sustainable practices in the nuclear industry and ensuring compliance with international non-proliferation commitments.",
