  "summary": "The concept of \"inspector of fisheries,\" redirected to \"fishing controls,\" pertains to the regulatory oversight of fishrooms and the sustainable management of marine resources within the EU. Inspectors are responsible for monitoring compliance with regulations, addressing issues such as misreporting and finning of elasmobranchii species, including the shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) and hammerhead sharks. Their duties involve overseeing fishing practices, including the use of gillnets and trammel nets, to prevent overfishing of sedentary species like sardinella. Additionally, inspectors track sightings and enforce regulations under the UN Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA) to ensure the health of marine ecosystems, including the Sargasso Sea. Their role is crucial in managing fishing quotas and ensuring that fish stocks are not dangerously depleted, thereby maintaining biodiversity and compliance with IUCN standards.",
