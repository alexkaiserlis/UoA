  "summary": "The concept of \"non-European language\" pertains to languages that are not officially recognized or utilized within the European Union's legal and regulatory frameworks. In the context of EU documentation, the use of non-European languages may arise in various scenarios, such as the translation of legal texts or the inclusion of multilingual provisions in treaties. Understanding this concept is crucial for ensuring compliance with linguistic diversity mandates and fostering inclusivity in communication. While the EU primarily operates in its official languages, the recognition of non-European languages highlights the Union's commitment to cultural plurality and the need for effective cross-border dialogue in an increasingly globalized environment.",
