  "summary": "International cooperation within the EU legal framework emphasizes multilateralism and the need for collaborative efforts to address global challenges. It encompasses various domains, including the prosecution of perpetrators of genocide and the condemnation of impunity for war crimes. The EU actively engages in initiatives such as the Comenius program, fostering interdisciplinary exchanges that enhance competitivity and regeneration of communities. Through teleinformatics and cofinancing mechanisms, the EU oversees projects that address issues like refugees and civilians' rights. Moreover, the EU's commitment to frameworks like UNCLOS and CWC reflects its dedication to humanity and the planet, ensuring that unpunished actions are rectified and that all parties adhere to international norms.",
