  "summary": "The \"nomenclature of agricultural products,\" also referred to as \"agricultural product nomenclature,\" is a vital regulatory framework established within EU legal documents to categorize and standardize various agricultural goods. This nomenclature ensures clarity in processes involving the trade and grading of products, such as poultymeat and tulips, while facilitating compliance with EU regulations. It encompasses a wide range of items, from neapolitanum to lilium, and addresses specific characteristics, including backfat and cartilage. The nomenclature also aids in the classification of rare species like danfordiae and hiemalis, ensuring that all agricultural products are adequately documented and regulated, thereby promoting fair trade practices.",
