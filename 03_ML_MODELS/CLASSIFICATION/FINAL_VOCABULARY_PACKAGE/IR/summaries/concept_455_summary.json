  "summary": "Economic discrimination refers to the unjust or prejudicial treatment of individuals or groups in economic contexts, often based on characteristics such as nationality, gender, or ethnicity. Within the framework of EU law, economic discrimination is addressed through various directives and regulations aimed at ensuring equal treatment and non-discrimination in the labor market, access to goods and services, and other economic activities. The EU's commitment to safeguarding rights and freedoms includes the prohibition of economic discrimination, promoting social inclusion and equality across member states. This legal principle is essential for fostering a fair and competitive internal market.",
