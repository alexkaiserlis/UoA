  "summary": "A \"roll-call vote\" is a formal voting procedure utilized in the European Union's parliamentary proceedings, where each Member of Parliament (MEP) is called individually to express their vote on a specific legislative proposal or resolution. This method ensures transparency and accountability, allowing constituents to ascertain how their representatives voted. Roll-call votes are particularly significant in contentious issues, as they provide a clear record of positions taken by MEPs. This process is governed by the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, which stipulates the circumstances under which roll-call votes are conducted, thereby reinforcing democratic principles within EU governance.",
