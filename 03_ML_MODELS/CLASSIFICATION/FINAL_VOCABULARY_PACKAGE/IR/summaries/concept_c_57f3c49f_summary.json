This concept is fundamental in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly in the context of enhancing resilience against threats, including terrorism and cyberattacks. The EU has established various directives and regulations aimed at ensuring the security of critical infrastructure, which encompasses sectors such as energy, transport, and telecommunications. By promoting cooperation among member states and fostering public-private partnerships, the EU seeks to mitigate risks and enhance the overall security posture of its critical infrastructure.",
