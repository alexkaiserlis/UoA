  "summary": "The concept of \"underground storage,\" redirected to the preferred term \"storage of hydrocarbons,\" pertains to the strategic containment of oil and gas resources within subterranean formations. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this practice is crucial for energy security, environmental protection, and compliance with safety standards. The European Union regulates underground storage through directives aimed at ensuring the integrity of storage facilities, minimizing risks of leakage, and promoting sustainable management of hydrocarbon resources. Effective regulation is essential for balancing energy demands with ecological considerations, thereby supporting the EU's broader energy transition objectives.",
