  "summary": "The concept of \"private property\" within EU civil law encompasses the legal rights and protections afforded to individuals regarding their ownership of assets. It is a fundamental principle enshrined in various EU treaties and regulations, reflecting the balance between individual rights and public interest. The protection of private property is crucial for fostering economic stability and encouraging investment. EU member states are required to respect these rights, ensuring that any interference is justified and proportionate, thereby upholding the rule of law. This concept also intersects with issues of expropriation and compensation, highlighting its significance in regulatory frameworks.",
