  "summary": "Cosmology, as a branch of natural and applied sciences, investigates the origins and evolution of the universe. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, cosmology may intersect with environmental regulations, particularly in areas concerning space exploration and the implications of cosmic phenomena on Earth. The EU's commitment to scientific research and innovation often encompasses cosmological studies, which can influence policy-making in fields such as climate change and sustainable development. As the EU fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, understanding cosmology's principles can enhance regulatory approaches to emerging technologies and their potential impacts on society and the environment.",
