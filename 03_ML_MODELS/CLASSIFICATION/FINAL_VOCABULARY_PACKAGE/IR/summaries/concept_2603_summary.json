  "summary": "The term \"tactical weapon\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"tactical nuclear weapon,\" which refers to nuclear arms designed for use on the battlefield rather than for strategic deterrence. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, tactical nuclear weapons are subject to stringent controls and treaties aimed at non-proliferation and disarmament. The European Union actively engages in discussions surrounding the regulation of such weapons, emphasizing the need for security, stability, and compliance with international obligations. The classification and management of tactical nuclear weapons are crucial for maintaining peace and preventing escalation in regional conflicts within the EU's geopolitical landscape.",
