  "summary": "Medium-term financial assistance, also known as balance of payments assistance, is a crucial EU regulatory mechanism aimed at supporting member states facing economic vulnerabilities. This assistance is articulated through measures that mobilize funds to lend to underprivileged economies, particularly during periods of retrenchment or worsened financial conditions. The European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) play significant roles in this context, providing resources to stabilize economies. By enabling member states to regain economic stability, these frameworks help prevent the culling of essential services and ensure the worthiness of settlements. The process involves complex comitology, where decisions are made to address specific needs, including the development of robust financial strategies and the revaluation of national currencies, thereby fostering a more resilient economic landscape across the EU.",
