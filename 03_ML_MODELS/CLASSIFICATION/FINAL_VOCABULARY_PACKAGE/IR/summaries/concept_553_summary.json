The EU's commitment to these rights is reflected in various treaties and regulations, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which emphasizes equality and non-discrimination. Additionally, the European Framework for National Minorities serves as a guiding document for member states to uphold and respect the rights of minorities, fostering inclusivity and diversity across the Union.",
