  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"standing committee\" refers to a permanent body established within the European Parliament or other EU institutions to facilitate ongoing discussions and decision-making on specific issues. These committees are tasked with scrutinizing legislative proposals, providing expert opinions, and ensuring compliance with EU regulations. They play a crucial role in the legislative process, enabling efficient management of complex matters that require continuous oversight. Standing committees enhance the democratic legitimacy of EU governance by involving representatives from member states, thereby fostering collaboration and accountability in the regulatory landscape.",
