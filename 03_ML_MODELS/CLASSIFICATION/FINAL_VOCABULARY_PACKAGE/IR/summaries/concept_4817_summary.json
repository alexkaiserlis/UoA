  "summary": "A \"sectoral agreement\" refers to a specific arrangement concluded between parties, aimed at regulating trade and cooperation within a defined sector, such as shipbuilding. This agreement empowers participants to establish mutual recognition of standards and guidelines, thereby facilitating efficient export operations. In the context of EU legal frameworks, such agreements are often aligned with OECD principles and may include annexes detailing applicable credits and obligations. The agreement continues to apply unless terminated, and may be amended to reflect changing circumstances. Hereinafter, the parties decide to update the arrangement, ensuring it remains relevant and effective in the sector.",
