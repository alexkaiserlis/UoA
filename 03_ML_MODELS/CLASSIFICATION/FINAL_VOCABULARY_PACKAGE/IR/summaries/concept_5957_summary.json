  "summary": "A \"demilitarised zone\" refers to a designated area where military forces and installations are prohibited, aimed at reducing tensions and fostering peace. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such zones are often established through international treaties or agreements, reflecting the EU's commitment to international security. The concept is critical in conflict resolution, as it serves to prevent military confrontations and promote diplomatic dialogue. As a redirect to the preferred term \"demilitarised zone,\" it highlights the EU's focus on maintaining stability in regions affected by conflict, thereby enhancing collective security measures within its broader geopolitical strategy.",
