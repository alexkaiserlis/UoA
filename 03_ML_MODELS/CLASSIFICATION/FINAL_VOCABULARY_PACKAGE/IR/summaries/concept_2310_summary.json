  "summary": "The concept of \"traditional fishing\" is classified within the EU's fisheries regulations, where it is described as a practice that adds cultural and economic value to coastal communities. This fishing method is partly regulated under specific provisions established in the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which ensures sustainable practices. The nomenclature relating to traditional fishing includes various subdivisions that are indicated in the statistical annexes of EU regulations. Pursuant to these rules, member states are required to adopt measures that support traditional fishing, thereby promoting trade in goods derived from these practices. The application of these provisions is essential for preserving the cultural heritage and biodiversity of marine resources.",
