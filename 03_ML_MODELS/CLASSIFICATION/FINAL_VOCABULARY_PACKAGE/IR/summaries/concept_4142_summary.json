  "summary": "Single-crop farming, categorized under the cultivation of agricultural land, refers to the agricultural practice of growing a single crop species over a specific area for consecutive seasons. This method, while potentially increasing short-term yields, raises concerns regarding biodiversity, soil health, and sustainable agricultural practices within EU regulatory frameworks. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) emphasizes the need for crop diversification to promote ecological balance and mitigate environmental impacts. Consequently, EU regulations encourage farmers to adopt more sustainable practices, moving away from single-crop farming towards integrated farming systems that enhance resilience and sustainability in agricultural production.",
