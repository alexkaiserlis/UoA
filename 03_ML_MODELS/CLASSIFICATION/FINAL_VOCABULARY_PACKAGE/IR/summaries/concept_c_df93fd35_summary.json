  "summary": "Text mining, often referred to as \"text and data mining,\" is a critical process in the analysis of large volumes of textual information within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. This technique enables the extraction of valuable insights from unstructured data, facilitating compliance monitoring, policy analysis, and the identification of trends in legal documents. The EU recognizes the importance of text and data mining in enhancing transparency and efficiency in information processing. As a redirect term, \"text mining\" underscores the broader scope of \"text and data mining,\" which encompasses both textual and numerical data extraction methodologies essential for informed decision-making in regulatory contexts.",
