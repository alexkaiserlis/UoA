  "summary": "The \"mechanisation of agriculture,\" a term redirected to the preferred term \"mechanisation of agriculture,\" refers to the integration of technical advancements in farming practices within EU agricultural policy. This concept is crucial for improving yields and processing efficiency, particularly in the production of cereals and rice. EU regulations set limits on intervention prices and establish criteria for corrective measures to enhance agricultural productivity. Agencies involved in this sector are tasked with updating management practices to reflect economic conditions and market demands. The implementation of these measures, as outlined in various EEC directives, aims to ensure sustainable agricultural development and value addition across member states.",
