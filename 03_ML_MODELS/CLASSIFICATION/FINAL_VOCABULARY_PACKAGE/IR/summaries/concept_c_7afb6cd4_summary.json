  "summary": "Common law is a legal system characterized by the development of law through judicial decisions and precedents rather than through legislative statutes. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, common law principles can influence member states that adhere to this system, particularly those in the UK and Ireland. The interplay between common law and civil law traditions in the EU raises complex questions regarding harmonization and the interpretation of EU regulations. While the EU primarily operates on codified law, understanding common law is essential for comprehending the broader legal landscape and its implications for cross-border legal issues within the Union.",
