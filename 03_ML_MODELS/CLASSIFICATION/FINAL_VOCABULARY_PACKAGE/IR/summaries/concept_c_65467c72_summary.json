  "summary": "Illegal logging refers to the unlawful harvesting, processing, and trade of timber, which poses significant threats to biodiversity, forest ecosystems, and sustainable forestry practices within the EU. Regulatory frameworks, such as the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR), aim to combat illegal logging by prohibiting the placing of illegally harvested timber on the EU market. This legislation requires operators to exercise due diligence in ensuring the legality of timber sources. The EU's commitment to sustainable forest management is further reinforced through international agreements and partnerships aimed at curbing illegal logging and promoting responsible forestry practices across member states.",
