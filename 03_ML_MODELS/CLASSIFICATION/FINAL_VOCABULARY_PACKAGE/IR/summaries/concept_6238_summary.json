  "summary": "\"?stra Mellansverige,\" a term redirecting to \"East Middle Sweden,\" refers to a region within the EU Member State of Sweden. This area is significant in the context of EU regulations concerning geographical indications and protected designations of origin (PDO) for agricultural products. Under EU law, particularly regulations published by the European Commission, regions like East Middle Sweden can apply for protection schemes that enhance the quality and reputation of local foodstuffs. Such applications are entered into an official register, ensuring that products from this region receive recognition and protection pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Parliament and Council oversee these regulations, which aim to support local economies and uphold standards.",
