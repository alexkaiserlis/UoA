  "summary": "The \"Moluccas,\" categorized under economic geography, refers to a group of islands in Indonesia, historically significant for their role in the spice trade. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, the Moluccas may be referenced in discussions regarding trade agreements, sustainable development, and regional economic cooperation. The islands' unique geographical position and resources necessitate regulatory frameworks that address environmental protection, cultural heritage, and economic sustainability.
