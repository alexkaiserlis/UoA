  "summary": "The \"electricity storage device\" is a critical component within the EU's regulatory framework for enhancing energy reliability and sustainability. These devices, including various types of accumulateurs, serve the purpose of storing électricité for later use, thereby supporting the transition to renewable energy sources. In the context of competition, the integration of advanced technologies from companies like Marelli and Webasto is essential for minimising energy waste and improving efficiency. Regulatory standards, such as those from TÜV, ensure that these devices meet safety and performance criteria. Moreover, the development of innovative converters and antennas is vital for embedding electricity storage solutions into existing infrastructures, including pavements and terraces, while addressing potential distinctions in usage across sectors like ferroviaria and automotive.",
