  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"expertise\" is often redirected to the term \"consultancy,\" which encompasses a multidisciplinary approach to policymaking. This concept involves professionals, such as lawyers, academics, and advisers, who provide tailored insights to various sectors. The workings of consultancy can be broad, addressing both ethical and uncompetitive practices in globalised markets. By consolidating knowledge from diverse fields, these experts engage in dialogues that reflect the focal points of contemporary issues, including disruptive technologies and regulatory challenges. Appointments of such consultants are crucial for ensuring that the prerogatives of stakeholders are adequately represented, thus enhancing the effectiveness of governance in complex contexts.",
