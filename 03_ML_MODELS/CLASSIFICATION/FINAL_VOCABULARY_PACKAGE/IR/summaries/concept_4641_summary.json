  "summary": "The concept of \"value added,\" redirected to the preferred term \"added value,\" is pivotal in EU accounting and regulatory frameworks. It refers to the enhancement a company gives its products or services, measured as the difference between sales revenue and the cost of inputs. In EU legal contexts, added value is crucial for assessing economic performance, compliance with financial regulations, and determining eligibility for funding under various EU programs. It also plays a significant role in evaluating the effectiveness of policies aimed at fostering innovation and competitiveness within the internal market, thereby contributing to the overall economic growth of the EU.",
