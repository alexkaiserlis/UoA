  "summary": "The concept of \"reassignment\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the strategic management of personnel, specifically in the context of personnel management and staff remuneration. Reassignment involves the transfer of an employee from one position to another, often to optimize workforce efficiency or address organizational needs. This process is governed by regulations that ensure fairness, transparency, and adherence to established protocols, safeguarding employee rights. In the EU context, reassignment may also reflect broader labor market policies aimed at enhancing mobility and adaptability within the workforce, thereby contributing to the overall effectiveness of public administration and service delivery.",
