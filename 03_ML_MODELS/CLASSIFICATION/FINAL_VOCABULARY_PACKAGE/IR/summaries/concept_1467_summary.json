  "summary": "Political integration within the European Union (EU) refers to the process of aligning member states' political systems and policies to foster cooperation and unity. This concept is crucial for establishing a cohesive legal framework that supports the EU's objectives, including the promotion of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Political integration involves harmonizing legislation, enhancing institutional cooperation, and facilitating joint decision-making processes. It is essential for the effective implementation of cooperation policy, ensuring that diverse national interests converge towards collective goals. Ultimately, political integration aims to strengthen the EU's global standing and enhance its capacity to address transnational challenges.",
