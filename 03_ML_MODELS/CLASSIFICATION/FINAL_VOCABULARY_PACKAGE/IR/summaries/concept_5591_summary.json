  "summary": "Military discipline refers to the regulatory framework governing the conduct and behavior of armed forces personnel within the European Union. It encompasses a set of rules and standards designed to maintain order, efficiency, and accountability among military members. This concept is essential for ensuring operational effectiveness and adherence to international humanitarian law. Military discipline is enforced through various mechanisms, including codes of conduct, disciplinary procedures, and oversight by military authorities. In the EU context, it aligns with broader defense policies aimed at fostering cooperation among member states' armed forces, thereby enhancing collective security and operational readiness.",
