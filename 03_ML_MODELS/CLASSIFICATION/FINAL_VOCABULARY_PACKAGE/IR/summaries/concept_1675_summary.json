  "summary": "The \"validation of expenditure\" within the EU budgetary framework refers to the process of ensuring that allocated funds are utilized in accordance with eligibility criteria and regulatory standards. This validation is crucial for managing budgets effectively, as it involves assessing the totality of expenditures to prevent ineligibility and ensure compliance with programmed allocations. The Commission conducts this validation to maintain the integrity of financial operations, thereby safeguarding against mismanagement or crime. By validating expenditures, the EU can mobilise resources efficiently, reassess financial ratings, and warrant the clearance of funds for future projects, such as modernisation initiatives or migration programs.",
