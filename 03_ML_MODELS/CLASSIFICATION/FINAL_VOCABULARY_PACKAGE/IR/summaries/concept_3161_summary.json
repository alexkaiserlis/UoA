  "summary": "The concept of \"oil spill,\" redirected to \"oil pollution,\" pertains to the deterioration of the environment under EU regulations. This issue emphasizes the need for timely implementation of measures to prevent and address oil spills, which can be devastating to coastlines and marine ecosystems. The EU's regulatory framework, including MARPOL and MEPC guidelines, addresses spillage incidents involving shipwrecks and collisions, highlighting the importance of segregated ballast systems and the use of dispersants. Lessons learned from past disasters, such as the Erika incident, underscore the necessity of repairing the incoherence in existing protocols. The EU aims to create a cleaner haven for marine life while ensuring that naval operations, including pilotage, do not contribute to further pollution.",
