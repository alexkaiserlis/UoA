  "summary": "The concept of \"fluctuation of exchange rates,\" often referred to as \"floating rate,\" pertains to the continuous alteration of currency values in response to market dynamics. In EU regulatory frameworks, this fluctuation can impel multilateralization of trade agreements and affect the convertibility of currencies, including the euro and its parities with other currencies. Such variations may lead to revaluation or discounting of assets, influencing settlements and the financial readiness of member states. The ensuing consequences can disturb economic stability, necessitating interventions by central banks and governors. Legal statutes may confer immunities and privileges to mitigate abnormally high fluctuations, ensuring a fair and stable monetary environment.",
