  "summary": "The concept of \"nationality\" in EU legal and regulatory contexts is primarily synonymous with \"citizenship,\" which serves as the preferred term. Nationality denotes the legal relationship between an individual and a state, conferring rights and obligations, particularly in the realm of executive power and public service. In the EU framework, citizenship encompasses the rights granted to citizens of member states, including free movement, political participation, and access to public services. Understanding nationality is crucial for interpreting EU regulations and directives that govern the rights of individuals within the Union, emphasizing the importance of citizenship in fostering integration and unity among member states.",
