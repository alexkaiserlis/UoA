  "summary": "The concept of \"indirect election\" refers to a voting procedure where representatives are chosen not directly by the electorate but through an intermediary body. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, indirect elections are pivotal in various institutional settings, such as the selection of members of the European Parliament by national parliaments or the appointment of the European Commission. This method contrasts with direct elections, emphasizing the role of representative democracy within the EU. Indirect elections ensure that elected officials are accountable to their constituents while facilitating a structured electoral process that aligns with EU governance principles.",
