  "summary": "The concept of \"social impact,\" which redirects from \"societal impact,\" is pivotal in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly within the social framework category. It articulates the implications of policies and initiatives on various demographics, including the elderly and vulnerable groups. The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the European Central Bank (ECB) emphasize the need for a harmonious approach to social issues, addressing the challenges faced by aging populations and fostering entrepreneurship. Stakeholders, including managers and policymakers, receive guidance on integrating social impact assessments into macroeconomic strategies, ensuring that economic movements complement societal needs. This tool aids in stabilisation efforts and enhances solidarity across member states.",
