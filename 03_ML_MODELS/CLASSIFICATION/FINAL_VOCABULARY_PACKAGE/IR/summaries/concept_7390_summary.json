  "summary": "The \"sociology of law\" examines the interplay between legal systems and societal norms, focusing on how laws influence social behavior and vice versa. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this discipline is crucial for understanding the socio-legal implications of EU legislation and policy-making. It explores how diverse legal cultures within member states shape the implementation of EU law, fostering compliance and addressing legal pluralism. By analyzing the societal impacts of legal norms, the sociology of law aids in evaluating the effectiveness of regulatory measures, ensuring that they resonate with the values and practices of European citizens.",
