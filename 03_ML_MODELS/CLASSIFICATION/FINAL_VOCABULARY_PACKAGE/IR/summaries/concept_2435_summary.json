  "summary": "The concept \"species of fish,\" categorized under fisheries (5641), redirects to the preferred term \"fish.\" This encompasses various species, including theragra and chalcogramma, which are vital for EU fisheries regulations. The legal framework aims to ensure sustainable practices, addressing concerns such as the prevalence of astaxanthin in aquaculture and the impact of fishing on ecosystems, including habitats like Fuglafjordur. The EU's fisheries policies also consider socio-economic factors, supporting local industries like fiskeindustri in regions such as Norway and Denmark. Additionally, regulations may involve monitoring fish health to prevent issues like cataracts and ensure quality, as seen in products from areas like Alberta and Newfoundland.",
