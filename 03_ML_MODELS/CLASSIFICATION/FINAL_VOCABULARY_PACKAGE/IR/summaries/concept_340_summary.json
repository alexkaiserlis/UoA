  "summary": "Decentralisation, as a pivotal concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, emphasises the distribution of executive power and public service functions away from central authorities. This approach aims to create a viable partnership between local agents and NGOs, fostering intensive dialogue and consultations that address numerous regional needs. The incorporation of decentralised initiatives is particularly relevant in the context of the Cotonou Agreement, which pursues lasting development in ACP countries. By following a dual approach, the EU seeks to remedy violations of substantive rights, thereby achieving real budgetary impacts. This decentralised strategy places a focal point on legislative acts that gear towards effective governance and promote sustainable development across diverse regions, including Latin America and Asia.",
