In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, ship canals are critical for enhancing connectivity between ports and inland areas, thereby promoting economic development and sustainable transport solutions. The European Union supports the construction and maintenance of such canals through various funding mechanisms and regulatory guidelines, ensuring compliance with safety, environmental, and operational standards. These waterways play a vital role in the EU's transport policy, contributing to the integration of the internal market and the reduction of road congestion.",
