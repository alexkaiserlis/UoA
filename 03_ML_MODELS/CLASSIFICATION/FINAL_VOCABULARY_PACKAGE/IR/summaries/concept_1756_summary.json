  "summary": "The concept of \"respiratory disorder,\" redirected to the preferred term \"respiratory disease,\" encompasses a range of chronic conditions, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In the EU regulatory context, physicians are committed to educating patients about these diseases, which can be exacerbated by environmental factors such as halogenated substances, including chlorofluorocarbons and halons. The EU endeavors to minimize the depletion of the ozone layer by regulating these harmful substances. This includes authorizing alternatives that are environmentally feasible and recognizing the need for metered dose inhalers (MDIs) that utilize recycled materials. The regulation of these products is crucial for public health and safety, as it directly impacts the treatment of patients with pulmonary disorders.",
