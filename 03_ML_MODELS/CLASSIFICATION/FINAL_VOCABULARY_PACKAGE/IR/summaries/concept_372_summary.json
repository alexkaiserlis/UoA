  "summary": "The concept of \"job perspective,\" redirected to \"job access,\" encompasses the EU's legal and regulatory framework aimed at enhancing employment opportunities for diverse demographics, particularly migrants and youth. This initiative promotes dignity and equality in the labour market by addressing inequalities and imbalances in job access. The EU urges employers to rethink recruitment strategies, furthering the integration of underrepresented groups. By investing in modules that disseminate information on available roles, the EU encourages a stimulating environment for job seekers. This flagship approach aims to diversify the workforce, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of gender or background, can access advertised positions and achieve positive outcomes.",
