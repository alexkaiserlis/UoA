  "summary": "The \"wage gap,\" a concept redirected to \"equal pay,\" is integral to EU legal frameworks aimed at achieving gender equality in employment. Despite existing differences in remuneration between men and women, EU laws reinforce the principle of equal pay for equal work, facilitating balanced access to vocational training and employment opportunities. Various resolutions and directives have been adopted to protect employees' rights, making it a priority to approximate living standards across member states. Efforts to improve pay equality are recognized as essential for the advancement of social justice, ensuring that all employees receive fair compensation for their responsibilities.",
