  "summary": "A \"management buy-out\" (MBO) refers to a transaction where a company's management team acquires a significant portion or all of the company, often leveraging existing assets. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, MBOs are subject to various regulations concerning corporate governance, competition law, and financial disclosures. The term is redirected to \"company buyout,\" which encompasses similar transactions but may also include other forms of buyouts. MBOs can facilitate restructuring and enhance operational efficiency, aligning with the EU's objectives of promoting competitive markets and sustainable business practices.",
