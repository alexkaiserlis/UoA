  "summary": "\"Legal incapacity\" refers to the inability of an individual to engage in legal acts due to certain conditions, such as age or mental state. In EU legal and regulatory contexts, this concept is closely related to \"legal capacity,\" which denotes the ability to exercise rights and obligations. Legal incapacity is significant in civil law, influencing matters such as contract formation and the validity of legal transactions. Understanding the nuances of legal capacity is essential for ensuring compliance with EU regulations, particularly in safeguarding the rights of vulnerable individuals. Thus, \"legal incapacity\" serves as a redirect to the more encompassing term \"legal capacity.\"",
