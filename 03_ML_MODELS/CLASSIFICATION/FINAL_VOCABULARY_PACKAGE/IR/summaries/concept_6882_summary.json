  "summary": "The concept of \"regional State\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework refers to a political entity that possesses a degree of autonomy, enabling it to exercise certain powers distinct from the central government. This status is often linked to the principles of subsidiarity and regional governance, which aim to enhance local decision-making and democratic participation. Regional States may have legislative authority in specific areas, contributing to the overall political structure of the EU. Understanding this concept is crucial for analyzing the distribution of competencies and the interplay between various governance levels within the Union, particularly in contexts of regional development and cohesion policy.",
