  "summary": "The concept of \"pasteurised milk,\" a redirect to the preferred term, encompasses a category of processed agricultural produce regulated within the EU framework. This milk undergoes treatments, such as microfiltered and UHT processes, to eliminate pathogenic bacteria like Listeria monocytogenes and Enterobacter spp., ensuring microbiological safety for consumers, particularly infants. Regulatory measures harmonise standards for pasteurised milk, addressing issues of provenance and labeling to prevent misleading advertising. The omission of essential information on labels can confuse consumers regarding the safety and quality of foodstuffs. Routine checks and methodological justifications underpin the regulation of this essential dairy product, which is vital for public health and shelf stability.",
