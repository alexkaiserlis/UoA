  "summary": "A \"psychometric test\" refers to a standardized assessment designed to measure psychological attributes such as cognitive abilities, personality traits, and emotional intelligence. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, psychometric tests are often employed in recruitment processes, particularly within public sector employment, to ensure fairness and objectivity in candidate selection. These assessments must comply with EU anti-discrimination laws, ensuring that they do not disproportionately disadvantage any group based on protected characteristics. Additionally, the use of psychometric tests is subject to data protection regulations, particularly the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which governs the processing of personal data in the EU.",
