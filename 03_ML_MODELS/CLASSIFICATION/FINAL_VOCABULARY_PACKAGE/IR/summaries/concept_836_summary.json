  "summary": "\"Compulsory saving\" refers to a regulatory mechanism within the EU's national accounts framework, aimed at promoting fiscal responsibility among member states. This concept mandates that governments set aside a portion of their revenues to ensure financial stability and sustainability. By enforcing compulsory saving, the EU seeks to mitigate the risks associated with excessive public debt and to enhance economic resilience. This practice is particularly relevant in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact, which emphasizes the importance of maintaining budgetary discipline. Ultimately, compulsory saving serves as a tool for fostering long-term economic health within the EU.",
