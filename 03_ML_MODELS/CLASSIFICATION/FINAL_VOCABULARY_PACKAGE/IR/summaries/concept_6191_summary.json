  "summary": "Digitisation is a pivotal concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, encompassing the transformation of cultural heritage and documentation into digital formats. This process aims to enhance accessibility and preserve diverse cultures for future generations. The EU has launched flagship initiatives that invite specialists to assess the advisability of digitisation strategies, ensuring unhindered access to online resources. By assigning tasks to experts, the EU promotes the flowering of digital domains, fostering competitiveness and growth in society. The agenda also emphasizes the importance of respecting individual rights during disclosure and the creation of improved employment opportunities in the digital landscape.",
