  "summary": "The \"culture industry\" concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses various fields that promote and protect cultural expressions and freedoms. It includes specific arrangements and cooperation between parties, such as the European Economic Area (EEA) and member states.

Articles concerning this area are adopted by the Parliament and the Council, ensuring that provisions are implemented effectively. The functioning of the culture industry is crucial for economic development and social cohesion, as outlined in official documents and decisions.",
