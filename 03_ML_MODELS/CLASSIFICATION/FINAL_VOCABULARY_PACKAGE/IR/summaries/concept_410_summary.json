  "summary": "Deregulation refers to the process of reducing or eliminating government rules and restrictions that govern economic activities within the European Union. This concept is pivotal in the context of EU economic policy, as it aims to enhance market efficiency, foster competition, and stimulate innovation. By removing regulatory barriers, deregulation can lead to increased investment and consumer choice. However, it also raises concerns regarding potential negative externalities, such as reduced consumer protection and environmental standards. The EU's approach to deregulation is often balanced with the need to maintain a coherent legal framework that safeguards public interests while promoting economic growth.",
