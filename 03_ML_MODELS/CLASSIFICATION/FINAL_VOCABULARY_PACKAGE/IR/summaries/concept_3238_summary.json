  "summary": "\"Very short-term financing\" refers to a financial mechanism utilized within the European Union to address immediate liquidity needs of entities, typically with maturities ranging from overnight to a few weeks. This form of financing is crucial for maintaining operational stability, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) facing cash flow challenges. Regulated under EU financial frameworks, it ensures compliance with monetary policies and promotes financial stability. Very short-term financing instruments may include treasury bills or commercial paper, which facilitate rapid access to capital while minimizing risk exposure. This concept plays a vital role in the EU's broader economic governance and financial regulation landscape.",
