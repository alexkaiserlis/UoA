  "summary": "The \"use of languages\" concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks emphasizes the obligation of institutions to provide authentic documents in multiple languages, thereby empowering citizens and ensuring access to justice. The treaties, including the constitution and protocols, specify that all official languages, including Irish, are accorded equal status. This principle is crucial for the drafting of statutes and acts, which must be translated and reviewed at regular intervals. The EU institutions are bound to decide on language matters unanimously, with derogation permitted only under specific circumstances. This framework positively impacts communication and collaboration across member states, particularly in areas like energy and atomic regulation.",
