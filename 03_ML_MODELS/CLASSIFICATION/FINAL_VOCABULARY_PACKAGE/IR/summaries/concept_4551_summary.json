  "summary": "The concept of \"night work\" pertains to the organization of work and working conditions within the EU framework. It involves employment activities conducted overnight, which may incur specific allowances and adaptations to ensure satisfactory working conditions for beneficiaries. The European Union, through various directives, has laid down provisions that take into account the unique challenges faced by night workers, including health impacts and economic adjustments. Member states, such as Belgium, are tasked with granting appropriate allowances and ensuring that night work is compensated fairly. The decision-making process involves experts and committees that assess the implications of night work on social and economic indices, ensuring compliance with EEC regulations and the Euratom Treaty.",
