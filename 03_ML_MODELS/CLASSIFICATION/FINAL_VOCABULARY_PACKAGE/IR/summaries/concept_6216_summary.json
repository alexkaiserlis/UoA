  "summary": "The \"policy of consumerism,\" redirected to \"consumer policy,\" encompasses a constitutional framework aimed at the protection and fulfilment of consumer freedoms within the EU. This policy commences with the entry of various entities into the consumer protection area, ensuring that all eligible parties participate in activities that promote consumer rights. The EU cooperates with EFTA and EEA states to extend protections, resulting in joint actions that amend existing regulations. Draft amendments may include annexed protocols that decide the costs incurred by consumers, irrespective of the fields involved. This comprehensive approach aims to enhance consumer participation and safeguard their interests across member states.",
