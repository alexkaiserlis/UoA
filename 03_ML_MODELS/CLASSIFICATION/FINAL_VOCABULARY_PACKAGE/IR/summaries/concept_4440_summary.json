  "summary": "The term \"terms of trade\" refers to the conditions under which goods and services are exchanged between parties, particularly in the context of international trade agreements. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these terms are crucial for establishing equitable trade relationships, ensuring compliance with trade regulations, and promoting fair competition. The EU negotiates terms of trade through bilateral and multilateral agreements, which outline tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers. Understanding these terms is essential for businesses and policymakers to navigate the complexities of the single market and to uphold the principles of the EU's internal and external trade policies.",
