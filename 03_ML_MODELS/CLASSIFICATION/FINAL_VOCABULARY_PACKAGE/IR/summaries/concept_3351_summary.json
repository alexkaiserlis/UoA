  "summary": "The concept of \"person with an intellectual disability\" is redirected to the preferred term \"mentally disabled person\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. This terminology is crucial in social affairs, particularly in the context of ensuring the rights and integration of individuals with intellectual disabilities. The EU promotes policies aimed at enhancing the quality of life and social inclusion for mentally disabled persons, emphasizing their dignity and autonomy. Legal instruments, such as the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, guide EU member states in addressing the needs and rights of this demographic, fostering an inclusive society that respects diversity and equality.",
