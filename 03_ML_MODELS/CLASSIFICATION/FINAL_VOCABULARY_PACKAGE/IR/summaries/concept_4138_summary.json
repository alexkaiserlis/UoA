  "summary": "The \"thesaurus\" in the context of EU legal and regulatory documents serves as a structured vocabulary tool that facilitates the organization and retrieval of information. It aids in standardizing terminology across various legal texts, ensuring consistency and clarity in communication. By providing a hierarchical arrangement of terms, the thesaurus enhances the precision of legal drafting and interpretation, which is crucial for effective regulatory compliance. This concept is integral to documentation practices within EU institutions, promoting coherence in legal discourse and enabling efficient information management across diverse regulatory frameworks. Thus, the thesaurus plays a vital role in the legal landscape of the EU.",
