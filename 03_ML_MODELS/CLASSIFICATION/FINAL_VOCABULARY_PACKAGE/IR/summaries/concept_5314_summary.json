  "summary": "The concept of \"safety in the home,\" redirected to \"accident in the home,\" encompasses various hazards that can lead to fatalities and injuries within domestic environments. EU legal frameworks aim to harmonize safety standards for household appliances, recognizing risks associated with flammable liquids, electrical circuits, and mechanical objects. Regulatory publications address shortcomings in safety measures, emphasizing the need for fireproof materials and proper disposal of hazardous substances like trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene. Additionally, guidelines for the safe use of toys, batteries, and lamps are crucial in preventing accidents. By citing these hazards, the EU seeks to obviate risks and protect victims from domestic explosions and fumes.",
