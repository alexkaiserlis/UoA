  "summary": "The concept of \"business name\" within the EU legal framework refers to the distinctive title under which a business operates, serving as a key identifier in commercial transactions. It is crucial for establishing a business's identity and protecting its reputation. The registration of a business name is governed by national laws, which align with EU directives aimed at ensuring transparency and consumer protection. A business name must not mislead consumers or infringe upon existing trademarks, thereby fostering fair competition. This concept is integral to the regulation of business organisations, facilitating legal recognition and accountability in the marketplace.",
