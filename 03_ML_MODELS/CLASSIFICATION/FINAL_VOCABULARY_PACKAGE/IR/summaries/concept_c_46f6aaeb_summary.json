  "summary": "Policymaking within the EU context refers to the structured process through which the European institutions develop, implement, and evaluate policies that govern member states. This process is characterized by the interplay of executive power and public service, ensuring that regulations align with the overarching goals of the Union. Policymaking involves extensive consultation, negotiation, and consensus-building among various stakeholders, including the European Commission, the European Parliament, and national governments. The effectiveness of policymaking is crucial for addressing transnational challenges, fostering economic growth, and enhancing social cohesion across the EU, thereby reinforcing the legitimacy and functionality of the Union's legal framework.",
