  "summary": "The \"ordinary legislative procedure\" is a fundamental process in the European Union's decision-making framework, primarily governed by Articles 294 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This procedure involves a co-decision mechanism whereby the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union jointly adopt legislation. It encompasses several stages, including proposal, examination, and adoption, ensuring that both institutions have equal legislative power. The ordinary legislative procedure is essential for fostering democratic legitimacy and accountability within EU law, facilitating the enactment of regulations and directives that impact member states and their citizens.",
