  "summary": "The concept of \"distribution by sex\" pertains to the demographic analysis of populations within the European Union, focusing on the quantitative representation of males and females. This concept is crucial for understanding gender disparities in various sectors, including employment, education, and health. EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such as the Gender Equality Strategy, utilize this data to inform policies aimed at promoting gender balance and addressing inequalities. Accurate distribution by sex statistics are essential for effective policymaking, enabling the EU to monitor progress towards gender equality and implement targeted interventions that foster inclusivity and equitable opportunities for all genders.",
