  "summary": "The \"boreal forest\" represents a significant ecological and regulatory concept within the EU's forestry framework. Characterized by its coniferous trees and unique biodiversity, the boreal forest plays a crucial role in carbon sequestration and climate regulation. EU legal instruments, such as the EU Forest Strategy, emphasize sustainable management practices to preserve these vital ecosystems. The boreal forest is also integral to the EU's commitments under international agreements addressing climate change and biodiversity loss. Effective governance and regulatory measures are essential to ensure the protection and sustainable use of boreal forest resources, aligning with broader environmental objectives within the EU.",
