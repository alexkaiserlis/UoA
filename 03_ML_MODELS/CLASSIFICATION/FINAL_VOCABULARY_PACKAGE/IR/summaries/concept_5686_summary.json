  "summary": "The concept of \"interest in bringing court proceedings,\" also referred to as \"interest in bringing an action,\" is pivotal in EU legal frameworks. It pertains to the legal standing required for individuals or entities to initiate litigation. This interest must demonstrate a sufficient connection to the matter at hand, ensuring that the party has a legitimate stake in the outcome. In EU regulatory contexts, this principle safeguards judicial resources by preventing frivolous claims and promotes access to justice by allowing those with genuine grievances to seek redress. Understanding this concept is essential for navigating the complexities of EU law and litigation processes.",
