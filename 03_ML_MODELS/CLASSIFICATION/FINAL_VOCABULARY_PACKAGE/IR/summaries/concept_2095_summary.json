  "summary": "A \"cooperation agreement\" within the EU legal framework signifies a formal arrangement between entities, often channeled through a consortium. These agreements are noteworthy for their role in fostering autonomic collaboration on various projects, including those related to armament and technological advancements. For instance, agreements may involve entities like Ericsson or Alcatel, focusing on encoding and amortization of shared resources. The predefinition of roles and responsibilities is crucial, as is the management of sublicences to ensure compliance. Such agreements can alleviate barriers to cooperation, enabling participants to succeed in joint initiatives, such as educational programs like Comenius or research subprogrammes.",
