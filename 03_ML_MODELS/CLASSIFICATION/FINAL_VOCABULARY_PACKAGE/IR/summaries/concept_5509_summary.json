This committee empowers its members to administer and oversee various regulatory frameworks, including the issuance of appendices related to specific agreements. It plays a crucial role in the renegotiation of treaties, ensuring that clauses are modernized and reflect current realities. The joint committee may also address issues such as the transport of commodities, coding of regulations, and the simplification of formalities. By conferring authority on its members, it enhances the efficiency of decision-making processes, thereby restoring trust and fostering collaboration among member states.",
