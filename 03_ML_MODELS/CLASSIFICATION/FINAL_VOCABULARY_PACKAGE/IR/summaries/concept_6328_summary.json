  "summary": "The concept of \"Mediterranean forest\" pertains to the unique ecosystems found in the Mediterranean region, characterized by diverse flora and fauna adapted to its specific climatic conditions. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, Mediterranean forests are significant for biodiversity conservation, sustainable forestry practices, and climate change mitigation. The EU's policies, such as the Natura 2000 network, aim to protect these vital habitats, ensuring the preservation of their ecological integrity. Furthermore, regulations governing forest management and land use in the Mediterranean region are essential for promoting sustainable development and combating desertification, thereby enhancing the resilience of these ecosystems.",
