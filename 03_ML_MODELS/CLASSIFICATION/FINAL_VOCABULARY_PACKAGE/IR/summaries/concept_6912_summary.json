  "summary": "The concept of \"tunnel\" within the EU transport policy framework encompasses various regulatory aspects related to the construction, maintenance, and safety of tunnels. These structures are pivotal for facilitating traffic and linking regions, thereby enhancing territoriality and intra-EU connectivity. The authorisation process for tunnel projects often involves a designated secretariat that assesses requests for derogating from standard regulations. This includes considerations of taxation and charging mechanisms for tunnel usage. Moreover, the entire perimeter of tunnel operations must adhere to safety standards, ensuring that all supplies and maintenance activities are conducted responsibly. In Italy and France, specific letters of authorisation are required, reflecting the unique regulatory environments of these member states.",
