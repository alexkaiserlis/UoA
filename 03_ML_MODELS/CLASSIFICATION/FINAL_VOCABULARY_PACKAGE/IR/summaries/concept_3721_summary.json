  "summary": "The concept of \"wealth\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the comprehensive assessment of national accounts. It encompasses various dimensions of economic prosperity, including the accumulation of assets, liabilities, and overall financial stability of member states. In EU regulations, wealth is often analyzed to inform fiscal policies, social welfare programs, and economic growth strategies. Accurate measurement of wealth is crucial for the formulation of sustainable development goals and for ensuring equitable distribution of resources among EU citizens. Thus, it plays a pivotal role in shaping economic governance and enhancing the resilience of the European economy.",
