  "summary": "The concept of \"mass production\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework refers to the large-scale manufacturing of goods, characterized by standardized processes and high output. This production method is often subject to various regulations aimed at ensuring product safety, environmental sustainability, and fair competition. The EU has established directives that govern aspects such as quality control, labor rights, and environmental impact, which are crucial for maintaining compliance in mass production industries. Understanding these regulations is essential for manufacturers to navigate the complexities of the single market while adhering to EU standards and promoting consumer protection.",
