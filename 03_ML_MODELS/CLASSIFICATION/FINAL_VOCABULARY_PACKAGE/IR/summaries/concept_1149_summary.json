  "summary": "Economic geography, as a concept within the realm of natural and applied sciences, pertains to the spatial distribution of economic activities and resources. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, it plays a crucial role in understanding regional disparities, urban development, and the allocation of funding under various EU policies. Economic geography informs the formulation of regulations aimed at promoting cohesion and sustainable development across member states. By analyzing the interplay between economic activities and geographic factors, EU institutions can devise strategies that enhance competitiveness and address socio-economic inequalities, ensuring balanced growth throughout the Union.",
