  "summary": "Self-defence, within the context of EU criminal law, refers to the legal justification for an individual to use reasonable force to protect themselves from imminent harm. This concept is pivotal in determining the legality of actions taken in self-preservation scenarios. EU member states may vary in their interpretations and applications of self-defence, influenced by national legal traditions and human rights considerations. The principle aims to balance individual rights with societal safety, ensuring that defensive actions are proportionate and necessary. Understanding self-defence is crucial for legal practitioners and policymakers in harmonizing criminal law across the EU.",
