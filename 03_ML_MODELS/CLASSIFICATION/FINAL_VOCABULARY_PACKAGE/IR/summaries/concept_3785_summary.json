  "summary": "The \"siting of power stations\" refers to the regulatory framework governing the location and establishment of energy generation facilities within the European Union. This concept is integral to energy policy, as it encompasses environmental assessments, land use planning, and compliance with EU directives aimed at promoting sustainable energy practices. The siting process is influenced by various legal instruments, including the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which mandates thorough evaluations of potential ecological impacts. Additionally, member states must align their siting regulations with EU energy targets, ensuring that power stations contribute to the overall energy transition and security objectives of the Union.",
