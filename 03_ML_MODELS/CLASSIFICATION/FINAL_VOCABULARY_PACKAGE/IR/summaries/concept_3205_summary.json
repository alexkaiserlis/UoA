  "summary": "The \"theory of marketing\" encompasses strategies and principles that organizations utilize to promote products and services, ensuring consumer satisfaction and commitment. In the EU regulatory context, this theory is crucial for determining standards that govern promotional activities, particularly in sectors like floricultural products. Competent bodies assess applications and contracts to ensure operators fulfill commitments and guarantees. This involves a coherent strategy for allocating resources and introducing various marketing mediums. Observations on consumer interests and overall consumption patterns inform the achievement of planned objectives. The theory also supports the submission of proposals that align with EU regulations, ensuring professional standards are maintained across member states.",
