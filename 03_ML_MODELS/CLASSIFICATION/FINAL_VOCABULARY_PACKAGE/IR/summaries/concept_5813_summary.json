  "summary": "The concept of \"general legal principle\" within the EU legal framework refers to foundational norms that underpin the interpretation and application of EU law. These principles, often derived from the legal traditions of Member States and the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), serve as essential guidelines for ensuring consistency, fairness, and justice across the Union. They encompass fundamental rights, proportionality, and legal certainty, influencing both legislative and regulatory processes. By establishing a cohesive legal environment, general legal principles facilitate the harmonization of laws and enhance the protection of individual rights within the EU's diverse legal landscape.",
