  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"slander\" is often redirected to the preferred term \"defamation.\" Defamation encompasses both slander, which refers to spoken false statements that harm an individual's reputation, and libel, which pertains to written defamation. The legal implications of defamation are significant within the EU, as member states are required to balance the protection of individual reputation with the right to freedom of expression. Various EU directives and national laws delineate the parameters of defamation, ensuring that victims have recourse while safeguarding public discourse. Understanding this relationship is crucial for legal practitioners operating within the EU.",
