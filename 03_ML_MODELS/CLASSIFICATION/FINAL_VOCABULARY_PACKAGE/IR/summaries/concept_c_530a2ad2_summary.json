  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the term \"pollinator\" refers to species that facilitate the reproduction of flowering plants through the transfer of pollen. Pollinators, including bees, butterflies, and other insects, play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity and ensuring the health of ecosystems. The EU recognizes the significance of pollinators in agricultural productivity and food security, leading to various legislative measures aimed at their conservation. Initiatives such as the EU Pollinators Initiative and the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 underscore the need for protective regulations to mitigate threats posed by habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change, thereby safeguarding these essential natural agents.",
