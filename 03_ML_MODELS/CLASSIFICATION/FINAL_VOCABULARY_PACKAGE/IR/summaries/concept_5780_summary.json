  "summary": "The concept of \"Mediterranean third countries\" encompasses nations bordering the Mediterranean Sea, which are integral to EU diplomatic and economic relations. These countries, often characterized by fragility and socio-economic inequalities, are engaged in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (Euromed), fostering pluralism and tolerance. The EU's regulatory framework aims to leverage these relationships, promoting prosperity through initiatives like the MEDA programme. By discussing governance and corruption, the EU seeks to design policies that embrace entrepreneurial endeavours and bolster regional stability. The EBRD plays a pivotal role in financing projects that address weaknesses and generate hope for a more integrated Mediterranean region, enshrining these principles in its quinquennial assessments.",
