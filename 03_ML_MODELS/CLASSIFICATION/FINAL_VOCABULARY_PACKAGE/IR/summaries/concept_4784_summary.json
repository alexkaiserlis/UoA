  "summary": "The term \"mutual savings bank\" is a redirect to \"cooperative bank,\" which is a significant category within EU financial institutions and credit regulations. Cooperative banks operate on principles of mutuality and solidarity, providing financial services primarily to their members. They are governed by specific EU directives that ensure compliance with regulations concerning capital adequacy, consumer protection, and risk management. These institutions play a vital role in promoting financial inclusion and supporting local economies. The legal framework surrounding cooperative banks emphasizes their cooperative nature, distinguishing them from traditional banks and highlighting their commitment to member welfare and community development.",
