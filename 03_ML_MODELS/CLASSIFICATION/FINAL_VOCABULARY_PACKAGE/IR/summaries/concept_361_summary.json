  "summary": "Devolution, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the transfer of powers and responsibilities from central authorities to regional or local governments. This process is pivotal in enhancing democratic governance and public service efficiency, allowing for tailored responses to specific regional needs. In the EU, devolution can manifest through various mechanisms, including legislative frameworks that empower subnational entities. The concept is integral to the principle of subsidiarity, which advocates for decisions to be made at the closest possible level to citizens. Thus, devolution plays a crucial role in balancing executive power and fostering regional autonomy within the EU's multi-layered governance structure.",
