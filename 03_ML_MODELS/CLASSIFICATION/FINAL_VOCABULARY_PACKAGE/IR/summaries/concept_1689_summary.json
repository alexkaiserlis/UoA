  "summary": "In the context of EU labour law and labour relations, \"lockout\" refers to an employer's action of temporarily closing a workplace or denying employees access to it, typically during a dispute over terms and conditions of employment. This measure is often employed as a counteraction to strikes, aiming to exert pressure on employees or unions. Lockouts are regulated under various EU directives and national laws, which seek to balance the rights of employers and employees. The legality of lockouts may depend on specific circumstances, including the nature of the dispute and applicable collective agreements, ensuring compliance with broader principles of industrial relations.",
