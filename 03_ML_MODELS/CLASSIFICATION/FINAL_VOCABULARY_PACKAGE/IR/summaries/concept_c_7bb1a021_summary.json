  "summary": "Pseudonymisation, often redirected to the preferred term \"anonymisation,\" is a critical concept in EU legal and regulatory frameworks concerning data protection. It refers to the process of transforming personal data in such a way that it can no longer be attributed to a specific individual without the use of additional information. This technique enhances privacy by allowing data to be processed while minimizing the risk of re-identification. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), pseudonymisation is recognized as a valuable measure to safeguard personal data, promoting compliance and facilitating data sharing while ensuring individuals' rights are upheld.",
