  "summary": "The term \"motorway\" refers to a high-capacity road designed primarily for fast vehicular traffic, typically featuring multiple lanes and limited access points. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, motorways are subject to specific directives and regulations aimed at ensuring safety, environmental protection, and efficient land transport. The European Union promotes the development and maintenance of motorways as part of its Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), which facilitates seamless connectivity across member states. Compliance with EU standards is essential for motorway construction and operation, impacting infrastructure funding, traffic management, and cross-border transport regulations.",
