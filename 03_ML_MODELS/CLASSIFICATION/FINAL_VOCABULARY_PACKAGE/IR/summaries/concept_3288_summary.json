  "summary": "The concept of \"first aid\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses essential measures for managing injuries and emergencies. It is crucial for citizens to be familiar with the functionalities of first aid, particularly in incidents that may lead to fatalities or severe injuries. The deployment of automatic systems, such as eCalls, enhances the efficiency of emergency responses by triggering alarms and connecting to Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs). This interoperability ensures that incidents are handled coherently, reducing congestion and false alarms. Campaigns aimed at raising awareness about first aid practices are vital for safeguarding privacy and improving the overall effectiveness of emergency responses across the EU.",
