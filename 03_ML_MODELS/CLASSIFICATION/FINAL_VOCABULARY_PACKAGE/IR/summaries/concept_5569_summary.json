  "summary": "The concept of \"publishing deadline\" within EU legal and regulatory documents refers to the specific timeframe established for the dissemination of official communications and legislative texts. Adhering to these deadlines is crucial for ensuring transparency and accountability in the EU's decision-making processes. The timely publication of documents allows stakeholders, including member states and the public, to engage with and respond to regulatory proposals effectively. Failure to meet publishing deadlines can hinder the legislative process and affect the overall efficacy of EU governance. Thus, the concept underscores the importance of punctuality in the communication of regulatory information.",
