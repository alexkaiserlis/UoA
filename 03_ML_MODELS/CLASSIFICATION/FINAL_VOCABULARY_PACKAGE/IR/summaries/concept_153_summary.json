  "summary": "The concept of \"road building\" encompasses the construction and development of road infrastructure, including motorways and bridges, which are essential for linking regions such as Neisse and Guben. Within the EU legal framework, road building involves various mandates and regulations that govern contractors and entrepreneurs engaged in these works. The harmonization of standards across member states, including Baden and Aargau, ensures that construction practices meet official requirements. Taxation issues, such as VAT and turnover, are also pertinent, with negligible complications arising from cross-border projects. The process requires detailed attestation and adherence to national preferences, thereby fostering efficient routes and infrastructure development.",
