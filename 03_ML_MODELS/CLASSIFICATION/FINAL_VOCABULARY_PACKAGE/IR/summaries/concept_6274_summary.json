  "summary": "The term \"hard-core\" in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks is a redirect to \"enhanced cooperation,\" which is a mechanism that allows a subset of EU member states to pursue deeper integration in specific areas, such as patents. This approach addresses insurmountable challenges faced by jurisdictions that are customarily fragmented, enabling them to avoid the disincentivising effects of unanimity. Enhanced cooperation furthers the creation of a unitary patent system, which protects proprietors from infringing activities across borders. By facilitating translations and publications, it reinforces cooperation among SMEs and mitigates crises arising from evasive practices. This centralised system aims to streamline filing processes and ensure that damages are effectively reimbursed, thus enhancing legal certainty and coexistence among varying legal frameworks.",
