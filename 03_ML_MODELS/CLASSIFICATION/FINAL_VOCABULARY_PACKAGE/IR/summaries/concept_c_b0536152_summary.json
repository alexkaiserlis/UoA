  "summary": "Economic migration refers to the movement of individuals from one country to another for the purpose of improving their economic prospects, often through employment opportunities. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, economic migration is addressed through various directives and policies aimed at facilitating the entry and residence of third-country nationals. The EU emphasizes the need for a coherent migration policy that balances the labor market demands of Member States with the rights and integration of migrants. This concept is crucial for shaping labor mobility, addressing demographic challenges, and fostering economic growth within the EU.",
