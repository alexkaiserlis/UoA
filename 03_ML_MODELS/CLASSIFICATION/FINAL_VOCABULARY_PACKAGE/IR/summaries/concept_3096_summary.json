  "summary": "Regionalism, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the political and administrative processes that empower sub-national entities to exercise autonomy and governance over specific geographic areas. This concept is pivotal in shaping the EU's multi-level governance structure, where regional authorities play a significant role in policy implementation, particularly in areas such as economic development, environmental management, and cultural preservation. Regionalism fosters collaboration among diverse regions, enhancing democratic participation and ensuring that local interests are represented in broader EU decision-making processes. It underscores the balance between national sovereignty and regional autonomy, essential for cohesive EU integration.",
