  "summary": "Expropriation, within the context of EU civil law, refers to the legal process by which a government or public authority takes private property for public use, often necessitating compensation to the property owner. This concept is crucial in balancing the needs of societal development with the rights of individuals. The regulatory framework governing expropriation in the EU ensures that such actions are conducted transparently and justly, adhering to principles of proportionality and necessity. Expropriation is often invoked in infrastructure projects, urban development, and environmental conservation, reflecting the EU's commitment to public interest while safeguarding property rights.",
