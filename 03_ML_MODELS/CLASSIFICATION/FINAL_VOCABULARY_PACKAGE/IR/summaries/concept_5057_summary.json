  "summary": "The \"ECSC operating budget\" refers to the financial framework established for the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which was a foundational institution of the European Union. This budget encompasses the allocation of resources necessary for the ECSC's operations, including administrative expenditures and funding for various projects aimed at promoting economic integration within the coal and steel sectors. The budget is subject to EU financial regulations and oversight, ensuring transparency and accountability in the management of funds. Although the ECSC was dissolved in 2002, its operating budget remains a significant historical reference in discussions of EU finance and budgetary practices.",
