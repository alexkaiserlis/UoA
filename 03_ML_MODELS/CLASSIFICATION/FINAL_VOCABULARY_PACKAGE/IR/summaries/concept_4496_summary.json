  "summary": "Technology transfer in the EU context refers to the transnationally regulated process of sharing innovations, particularly in sectors such as defense and dual-use goods. This encompasses the brokering of technologies that could contravene international prohibitions, especially concerning ballistic munitions and fissile materials like plutonium and enriched uranium. The EU maintains vigilance through frameworks like the Wassenaar Arrangement, which clarifies the conditions under which sensitive technologies can be launched or inspected. Additionally, the EU's regulatory measures aim to prevent disparities in technology access, ensuring that ventures do not unintentionally stimulate illicit activities in regions like Libya, Syria, or Myanmar.",
