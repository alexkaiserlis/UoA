  "summary": "The concept of \"only child\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to familial structures and their implications for various policies, including social security, taxation, and child welfare. An \"only child\" is defined as a child who has no siblings, which can influence eligibility for benefits and support systems designed to assist families. In EU legislation, considerations for \"only children\" may arise in contexts such as parental leave, educational assistance, and healthcare provisions. Understanding this concept is essential for ensuring compliance with regulations that aim to protect the rights and welfare of children within the family unit.",
