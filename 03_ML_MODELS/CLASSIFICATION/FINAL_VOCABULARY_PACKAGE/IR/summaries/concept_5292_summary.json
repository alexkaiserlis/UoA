  "summary": "Organ transplantation refers to the medical procedure of transferring organs or tissues from donors to recipients, a process regulated within the EU to ensure safety and efficacy. The procurement of organs involves complex legal frameworks addressing the donation process, which includes characterisation and typing of tissues to minimize adverse reactions. Regulatory bodies, such as the ECDC, monitor the prevalence of chronic conditions necessitating transplantation. The urgency of organ needs often leads to cumbersome logistics in the repartition of donated organs. Effective communication among healthcare partners is essential to handle the complexities of organ preservation and to alert potential recipients and donors about risks, including antibody responses and sexual health considerations.",
