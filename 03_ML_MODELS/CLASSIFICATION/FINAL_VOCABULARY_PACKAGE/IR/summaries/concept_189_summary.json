  "summary": "\"Financial control\" within the EU regulatory framework refers to the mechanisms and processes employed to ensure the prudent management of public funds and compliance with applicable legal provisions. It encompasses various activities, including onsite and offsite audits, which aim to capture financial data and assess the integrity of institutions. Administrators are tasked with liquidating assets when necessary, while also ensuring that recapitalising measures are prudentially applied to mitigate contagion effects. The concept involves a comprehensive review of filings and disposiciones, ensuring that all financial operations are conducted in a candid manner. This includes monitoring securitisations and tranching practices, as well as adhering to countercyclical policies to maintain financial stability across member states.",
