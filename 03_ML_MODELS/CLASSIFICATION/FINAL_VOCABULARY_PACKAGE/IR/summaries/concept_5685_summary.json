  "summary": "The concept of \"collective interest\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the protection and promotion of interests shared by a group, particularly in the context of justice and social equity. It encompasses the idea that certain rights and benefits should be safeguarded not only for individuals but also for communities, thereby fostering a sense of solidarity. This principle is often invoked in cases involving consumer protection, environmental law, and public health, where the collective interest may supersede individual claims. The EU institutions aim to balance these collective interests with individual rights, ensuring comprehensive legal protection across member states.",
