  "summary": "The European Monetary Cooperation Fund (EMCF) was established to facilitate multilateralization of monetary relations among EU member states, ensuring the convertibility of currencies and the stability of parities. It administers interventions and settlements, benefiting holders of European Currency Units (ECUs). The EMCF's statutes confer privileges and immunities to its governors, promoting concertation and convergence in monetary policy. As the fund evolved, it merged with other entities, dissolving its previous structures while maintaining irrevocable commitments to support prosperous economic conditions. The EMCF's role is crucial in assuring that contractual obligations are met, enabling automatic repayments and fine-tuning the basket of reserves necessary for effective monetary governance.",
