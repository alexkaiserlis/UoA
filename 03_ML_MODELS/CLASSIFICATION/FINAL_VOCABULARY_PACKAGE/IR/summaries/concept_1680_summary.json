  "summary": "The concept of \"poem,\" categorized under culture and religion, is redirected to the preferred term \"literature\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. This relationship underscores the significance of literary creations, which embody originality and creativity, as essential components of cultural heritage. The EU copyright law, notably influenced by the Berne Convention, harmonizes the protection of authorship, ensuring that rightholders, including authors and their descendants, enjoy perpetual rights over their works. This legal structure promotes merit and safeguards the moral rights of creators, allowing for lawful broadcasting and rental of literary collections. Furthermore, the lifespan of copyright protection extends to various formats, including phonograms and photographic publications, thereby enhancing the accessibility of artistic expressions across generations. The EU's commitment to fostering creativity is evident in its efforts to harmonize regulations that govern the fixation and dissemination of literary works, ensuring that they remain enjoyed by the public while respecting the rights of rightholders.",
