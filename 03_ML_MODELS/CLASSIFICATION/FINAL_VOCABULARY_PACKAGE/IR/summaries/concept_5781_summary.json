  "summary": "The concept of \"Central and Eastern European countries\" (CEEC) encompasses nations that have undergone significant economic transformation since the end of the Cold War. In EU legal and regulatory contexts, CEECs are often highlighted for their unique challenges and opportunities, particularly in negotiating alignment with EU standards. The Interreg program facilitates cross-border cooperation, fostering the exchange of best practices among CEECs. Issues such as agricultural production, including the breeding of cows and goats, are regulated to ensure quality and compliance. The EU's presidency plays a crucial role in stipulating policies that address the ambiguity surrounding economic development, ensuring that all member states, including CEECs, are proportionately represented in discussions on topics like trade and environmental sustainability. This modus vivendi is essential for fostering a cohesive economic geography within the EU, awaiting further integration and cooperation.",
