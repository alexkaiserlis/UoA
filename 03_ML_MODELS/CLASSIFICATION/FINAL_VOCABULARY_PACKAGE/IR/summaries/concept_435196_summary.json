  "summary": "The concept of \"EU law - international law\" encompasses the intricate relationship between European Union legal frameworks and broader international legal principles. This intersection serves as a catalyst for harmonizing regulations across diverse disciplines, including sports like football, athletics, and volleyball, where tournaments and championships are governed by both EU law and international standards. The EU's legal system commands respect in international arenas, influencing broadcasting rights for major competitions, such as the UEFA Champions League and Olympic Games. As audiences engage with these events through various audiovisual broadcasts, the overriding principles of EU law ensure that rights are protected, fostering fair play and equitable participation in global sports.",
