  "summary": "Road cabotage refers to the transport of goods or passengers by a carrier within a member state other than the carrier's home country, which is regulated under EU law. This practice entails specific conditions to safeguard fair competition and prevent inequalities among carriers. The European Court of Justice upholds regulations that monitor cabotage operations, ensuring compliance with defined rules. Infringements can lead to penalties, and the posting of workers is a critical aspect, particularly for resident and non-resident operators. The gradual removal of restrictions aims to foster a mutual relationship among member states, enhancing urban and suburban transport efficiency while maintaining justice in employment practices.",
