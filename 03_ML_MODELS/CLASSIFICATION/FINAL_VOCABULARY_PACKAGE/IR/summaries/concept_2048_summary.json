  "summary": "The \"Dillon Round\" refers to a series of trade negotiations that took place under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) framework, specifically aimed at reducing tariffs and other trade barriers among member states. Initiated in the 1960s, these negotiations are significant in the context of EU tariff policy as they laid the groundwork for subsequent trade agreements and the establishment of a more integrated European market. The outcomes of the Dillon Round influenced the EU's approach to external trade relations, shaping its regulatory framework and tariff structures, thereby facilitating economic cooperation and promoting free trade principles within the EU.",
