  "summary": "The concept of \"parliamentary vote\" pertains to the formal decision-making process within the European Parliament, where Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) cast votes on legislative proposals, resolutions, and other matters. This procedure is integral to parliamentary proceedings, ensuring democratic participation and accountability in the EU's legislative framework. Each parliamentary vote is recorded and contributes to the legislative history, influencing future regulatory actions. The outcomes of these votes can significantly impact EU policies and directives, reflecting the collective will of the elected representatives. Thus, parliamentary votes are pivotal in shaping the legal landscape of the European Union.",
