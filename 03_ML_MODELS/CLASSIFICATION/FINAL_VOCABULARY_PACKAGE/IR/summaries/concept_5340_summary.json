  "summary": "A \"papal bull,\" categorized under documentation, refers to a formal decree issued by the Pope, often concerning significant ecclesiastical matters. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such acts, also known as \"papal acts,\" can influence international relations and the legal status of religious entities within member states. Although the term \"papal bull\" is a historical reference, it is redirected to the preferred term \"papal act\" to encapsulate its broader implications in contemporary legal discourse. These documents may intersect with EU law, particularly in areas involving religious freedom, cultural heritage, and diplomatic recognition.",
