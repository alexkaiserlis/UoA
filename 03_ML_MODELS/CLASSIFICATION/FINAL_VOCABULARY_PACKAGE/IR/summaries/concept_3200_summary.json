  "summary": "Cultural relations within the EU framework encompass the facilitation and promotion of diverse cultures, aiming to foster understanding and awareness among peoples. This concept necessitates the enactment of policies that integrate educational initiatives, youth movements, and informal exchanges, thereby turning cultural treasures into valuable assets for tourism and mobility. The EU advocates for styles of teaching that complement cultural dimensions, resolving congestion in cultural discourse. By recommending expedient measures, cultural relations aim to acquire genuine engagement abroad, supporting the foundations of a cohesive European identity while confronting challenges and promoting the integration of various cultural realities.",
