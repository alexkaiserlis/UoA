  "summary": "The \"specification of tariff heading\" is a critical aspect of the EU's 2011 tariff policy, detailing the classification of goods for customs purposes. This process ensures that items such as seasoned broth, noodles, and various seafood like sailfish and spearfish are correctly categorized under the appropriate tariff headings. The anatomy of tariff classification involves understanding complex regulations, including the treatment of specific goods like tampons and napkins, which may require separable classifications. Moreover, the use of advanced methods, such as refractometric analysis, aids in determining the tariff status of products like pastilles and arrowroot. The role of institutions like the Hauptzollamt is vital in enforcing these classifications, ensuring compliance with EU regulations while addressing pathophysiological concerns related to product safety.",
