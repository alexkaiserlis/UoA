  "summary": "The concept of \"woman farmer\" within the EU regulatory framework highlights the critical role of female agricultural practitioners in farming systems. Recognized as vital contributors to rural economies, woman farmers face unique challenges, including access to resources, training, and decision-making processes. EU policies aim to promote gender equality in agriculture, ensuring that woman farmers receive equitable support and recognition. This includes initiatives under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) that encourage sustainable farming practices and enhance the visibility of women in the agricultural sector. By addressing these issues, the EU seeks to empower woman farmers and foster inclusive growth in rural communities.",
