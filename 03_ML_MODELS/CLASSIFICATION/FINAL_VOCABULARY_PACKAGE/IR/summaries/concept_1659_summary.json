  "summary": "\"Liguria,\" categorized under regions of EU Member States, refers to a scenic coastal area in Italy, notably encompassing the city of Genoa. This region is characterized by its rich culinary heritage, including gourmet specialties like focaccia and formaggio. In EU legal and regulatory contexts, Liguria's regional governance is subject to stipulations that dictate its economic prerogatives and development strategies. The region has historically faced challenges such as economic instability and ailing industries, necessitating readjustments in policy frameworks. Additionally, Liguria's coastal seabed management requires scrutiny to neutralise environmental impacts, ensuring sustainable practices while addressing the demands of local stakeholders and the broader EU directives.",
