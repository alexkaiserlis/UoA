  "summary": "The term \"government programme\" refers to a strategic framework established by a governing body to outline its policy objectives and priorities within the context of executive power and public service. In EU legal and regulatory documents, a government programme serves as a foundational document that guides the implementation of laws and regulations, ensuring alignment with broader EU goals. It delineates the responsibilities of various public institutions and facilitates accountability in governance. By articulating specific initiatives and resource allocations, the government programme plays a crucial role in the effective execution of public policy, fostering transparency and public engagement in the democratic process.",
