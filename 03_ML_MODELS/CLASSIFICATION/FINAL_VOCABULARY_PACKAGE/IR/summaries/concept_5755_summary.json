  "summary": "The concept of \"new type of employment\" refers to emerging forms of work arrangements that deviate from traditional employment models within the EU labour market. This includes gig work, remote employment, and other flexible arrangements that challenge conventional definitions of employment. The EU's regulatory framework aims to address the implications of these new types of employment, ensuring workers' rights, social protection, and fair working conditions. As the labour market evolves, EU institutions are tasked with adapting legislation to encompass these innovative employment forms, thereby fostering inclusivity and sustainability in the workforce while safeguarding fundamental rights.",
