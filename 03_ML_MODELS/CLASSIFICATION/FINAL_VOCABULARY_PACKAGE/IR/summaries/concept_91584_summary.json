  "summary": "The concept of \"LGBTQ rights,\" categorized under \"rights and freedoms,\" encompasses the legal protections and entitlements afforded to individuals identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or other sexual and gender minorities within the European Union. This framework aims to combat discrimination, promote equality, and ensure the full enjoyment of human rights for LGBTQ+ individuals. The EU's legal instruments, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights, underscore the commitment to uphold these rights, fostering an inclusive society. As a redirect to \"LGBTQ+ rights,\" this term emphasizes the evolving recognition and safeguarding of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities in EU regulatory contexts.",
