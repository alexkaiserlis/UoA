  "summary": "The concept of \"socioprofessional category\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework refers to the classification of individuals based on their employment status and occupational tasks. This classification is crucial for ascertaining unemployment rates and understanding labour market dynamics. Regular surveys are conducted to gather statistical data, which is then analyzed to identify differences in employment practices across regions. These statistics are harmonized to ensure reliability and facilitate comparison. The structure of socioprofessional categories is particularly important for developing policies that address the needs of various groups, thereby enabling the effective allocation of structural funds and resources to carry out necessary changes in the labour market.",
