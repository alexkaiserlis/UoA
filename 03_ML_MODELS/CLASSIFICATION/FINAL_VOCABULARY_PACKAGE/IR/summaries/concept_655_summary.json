  "summary": "The concept of \"national economy\" pertains to the economic structure of a member state within the European Union. It encompasses the aggregate of economic activities, policies, and regulatory frameworks that govern production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. In EU legal and regulatory contexts, understanding the national economy is crucial for implementing cohesion policies, ensuring compliance with competition law, and fostering sustainable development. The EU's regulatory framework often seeks to harmonize national economic policies to promote stability and growth across member states, thereby enhancing the overall economic integration of the Union.",
