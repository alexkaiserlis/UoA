  "summary": "Forestry statistics encompass the systematic collection, analysis, and dissemination of data related to forest resources and activities within the European Union. These statistics are crucial for informing policy decisions, ensuring sustainable forest management, and monitoring compliance with EU regulations. They provide insights into forest area, timber production, and biodiversity, thereby supporting the EU's commitment to environmental sustainability and climate action. The legal framework governing forestry statistics is primarily established through various EU directives and regulations, which mandate member states to report accurate and timely data. This enables the EU to assess progress towards its forestry-related objectives effectively.",
