  "summary": "Hinterland transport refers to the movement of goods and passengers from ports to inland destinations, playing a crucial role in the organization of transport within the European Union. This concept is essential for enhancing connectivity and efficiency in the logistics chain, as it facilitates the seamless transfer of cargo from maritime to land transport systems. EU regulatory frameworks, such as the Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T) policy, aim to improve hinterland transport infrastructure, ensuring sustainable and integrated transport solutions. Effective hinterland transport systems are vital for achieving the EU's objectives of economic growth, environmental sustainability, and regional cohesion.",
