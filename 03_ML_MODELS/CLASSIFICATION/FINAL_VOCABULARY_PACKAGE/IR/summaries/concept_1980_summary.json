  "summary": "In EU competition law, the term \"sole buyer\" is synonymous with \"monopsony,\" a market structure where a single buyer exerts significant control over the market. This concept is crucial in assessing market dynamics, as a monopsony can lead to reduced prices paid to suppliers, potentially harming competition and innovation. The European Commission monitors monopsonistic practices to ensure fair competition, as they can distort market equilibrium and disadvantage producers. Understanding the implications of a sole buyer is essential for regulatory compliance and maintaining a competitive marketplace within the EU, where the protection of both consumers and suppliers is a priority.",
