  "summary": "The \"free movement of persons\" is a fundamental principle within EU law, catering to the rights of individuals to reside and work across member states without unreasonable restrictions. This legal framework facilitates the mobility of workers, students, and families, enabling them to reapply for residency or visas as needed. It concurrently addresses issues such as migrant rights and the need for diplomatic support in cases of disappearances or crises, like those affecting Belarusian or Indonesian nationals. By stipulating preconditions for entry and residence, the EU aims to lift outdated barriers while ensuring tangible benefits for its sovereign states, enhancing democracy and electoral participation across borders.",
