  "summary": "Communism, as a political framework, represents a socio-economic ideology advocating for the collective ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, communism is often referenced in discussions surrounding human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. The EU, founded on principles of liberal democracy, contrasts sharply with communist ideologies, which have historically led to authoritarian regimes. Consequently, the EU's regulatory framework emphasizes the promotion of democratic values and the protection of individual freedoms, often positioning itself in opposition to communist doctrines in its external relations and internal policies.",
