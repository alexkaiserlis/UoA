  "summary": "The concept of \"cable television,\" classified under the category of communications, is primarily redirected to the preferred term \"cable distribution.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, cable distribution encompasses the transmission of television signals via coaxial or fiber-optic cables, facilitating access to a variety of audiovisual content. The regulatory landscape, shaped by directives such as the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD), aims to ensure fair competition, consumer protection, and content diversity within the cable distribution sector. This concept is integral to understanding the broader implications of media regulation and the evolving landscape of telecommunications in the EU.",
