  "summary": "The concept of \"relations between the State and the regions\" pertains to the intricate legal and regulatory framework governing the distribution of powers and responsibilities within the European Union. This framework is essential for ensuring effective governance and public safety, as it delineates the competencies of national governments and regional authorities. In the EU context, these relations are influenced by principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, which aim to enhance local autonomy while maintaining cohesive state policies. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for interpreting EU legislation and fostering cooperation among various governance levels, ultimately contributing to the stability and functionality of the Union.",
