  "summary": "The \"transfer of competence\" in the context of European Union law refers to the process by which member states delegate specific powers or responsibilities to the EU institutions. This legal mechanism is essential for the functioning of the EU, allowing for a more integrated approach to governance and policy-making. Competences can be transferred in areas such as trade, environmental protection, and consumer rights, enabling the EU to enact legislation that is binding on member states. The transfer is governed by treaties, which delineate the scope and limits of these competences, ensuring that the principle of subsidiarity is upheld.",
