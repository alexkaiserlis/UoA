  "summary": "The \"appeal to the European Court of Justice\" (redirected to \"appeal to the Court (EU)\") is a legal mechanism allowing individuals and entities to challenge acts or decisions made by EU institutions. This appeal is exercised within the framework of treaties that govern the EU's legal order, ensuring coherence and alignment with established rights. The Court has jurisdiction to annul decisions that are deemed invalid, thereby creating a regime that protects the legal personality of applicants. Appeals can be lodged in various fields, including commercial and industrial law, and are vital for safeguarding property rights and ensuring justice across different instances.",
