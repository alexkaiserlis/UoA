  "summary": "The concept of \"employment structure\" refers to the composition and distribution of employment across various sectors and demographics within the European Union. It encompasses the analysis of labor market trends, including the proportions of full-time, part-time, and temporary employment, as well as the representation of different age groups, genders, and educational backgrounds. Understanding the employment structure is crucial for EU policymakers to develop effective labor regulations and social policies aimed at promoting equitable employment opportunities and addressing disparities. This concept plays a vital role in shaping initiatives that enhance workforce participation and adapt to evolving economic conditions within the EU.",
