  "summary": "The concept of \"international finance\" encompasses the regulatory frameworks and legal instruments governing monetary relations between states and financial entities. Within the EU context, it involves the coordination of monetary policies, the establishment of financial regulations, and the promotion of economic stability across member states. International finance is critical for facilitating cross-border investments, managing exchange rates, and ensuring compliance with international financial standards. The EU's regulatory bodies, such as the European Central Bank and the European Securities and Markets Authority, play pivotal roles in overseeing these monetary relations, fostering transparency, and mitigating systemic risks in the global financial landscape.",
