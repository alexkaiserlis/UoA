  "summary": "In the context of EU parliamentary proceedings, \"quorum\" refers to the minimum number of members required to be present for the assembly to conduct its business legally. This concept is crucial for ensuring that decisions made during legislative sessions reflect a legitimate representation of the body. The absence of a quorum can invalidate proceedings, thereby affecting the legislative process and the enactment of regulations. Establishing a quorum is essential for maintaining the integrity of democratic processes within the EU, ensuring that all decisions are made with adequate participation and oversight from elected representatives.",
