  "summary": "The concept of \"small states and territories,\" redirected to the preferred term \"small state,\" pertains to the unique economic geography of nations with limited geographical size and population. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, small states often face distinct challenges and opportunities, particularly in areas such as trade, governance, and regional development. These jurisdictions may benefit from tailored policies that recognize their specific economic contexts, ensuring equitable participation in the single market. Understanding the dynamics of small states is crucial for effective EU policymaking, as it fosters inclusivity and addresses the diverse needs of all member states, enhancing overall cohesion.",
