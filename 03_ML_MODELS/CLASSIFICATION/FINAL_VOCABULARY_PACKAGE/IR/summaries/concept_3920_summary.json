  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"genocide\" is often addressed under the broader term \"crime against humanity,\" reflecting the EU's commitment to prosecuting serious violations of human rights. The EU emphasizes the importance of confronting impunity for perpetrators of such crimes, ensuring that they are prosecuted effectively across jurisdictions. This includes investigating genocidal acts, as seen in the tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia, which have enhanced the prosecution of war crimes. The EU's judicial framework supports transnational cooperation in bringing suspected criminals to justice, ratifying statutes that affirm responsibilities in combating these violations and providing refuge for victims seeking justice.",
