  "summary": "Commercial farming, categorized under farming systems in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to agricultural practices aimed at producing goods for sale rather than subsistence. This concept encompasses large-scale operations that utilize advanced techniques and technologies to maximize yield and efficiency. In the context of EU regulations, commercial farming is subject to various directives concerning environmental sustainability, food safety, and agricultural subsidies. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) plays a crucial role in shaping the operational landscape for commercial farmers, promoting competitiveness while ensuring compliance with EU standards. This regulatory oversight is essential for maintaining market stability and supporting rural development.",
