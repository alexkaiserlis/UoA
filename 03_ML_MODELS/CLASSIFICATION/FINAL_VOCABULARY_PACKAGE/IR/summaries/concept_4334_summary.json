  "summary": "Supranationality refers to a legal and regulatory framework where authority transcends national boundaries, particularly within the European Union (EU). It embodies the principle that EU institutions can enact laws and regulations that member states are obliged to follow, thereby enhancing integration and cooperation among nations. This concept is pivotal in international law, as it facilitates collective decision-making and harmonization of policies across diverse jurisdictions. Supranationality empowers EU bodies, such as the European Commission and the European Parliament, to operate beyond the confines of individual state sovereignty, promoting a unified legal order and fostering stability within the region.",
