  "summary": "The term \"single parent\" refers to an individual who is responsible for raising one or more children without the support of a partner. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, single parents often encounter unique challenges related to family law, social security, and welfare provisions. The EU recognizes the need for policies that support single-parent families, ensuring access to adequate resources and protections. This includes considerations in areas such as child custody, maintenance obligations, and non-discrimination in employment. The legal recognition of single parents is crucial for promoting family stability and social cohesion within the EU member states.",
