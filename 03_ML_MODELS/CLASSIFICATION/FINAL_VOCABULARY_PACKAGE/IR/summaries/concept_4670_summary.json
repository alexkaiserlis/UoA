  "summary": "Wholesale selling refers to the distribution of goods in bulk, typically to retailers or other businesses rather than directly to consumers. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, wholesale selling is governed by various directives and regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition, consumer protection, and market transparency. This concept plays a crucial role in the supply chain, influencing pricing strategies and market access. Regulatory bodies monitor wholesale transactions to prevent anti-competitive practices and ensure compliance with trade laws. Understanding wholesale selling is essential for businesses operating within the EU market, as it impacts their marketing strategies and operational compliance.",
