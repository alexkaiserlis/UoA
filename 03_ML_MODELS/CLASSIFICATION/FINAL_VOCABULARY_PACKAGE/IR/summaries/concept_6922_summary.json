  "summary": "International labour law encompasses the legal frameworks governing the rights and responsibilities of employers and employees across borders. Within the EU context, it plays a foundational role in setting standards for working conditions, health, and safety. The appointment of advisory boards, which include representatives from member governments such as Belgium, Hungary, and Slovakia, occurs to oversee compliance and improvement in labour practices. This law also facilitates the nomination of candidates for various posts within international organisations. Hereinafter, it ensures that all languages are respected in legal documents, promoting inclusivity and understanding among diverse member states like Italy, France, and Greece.",
