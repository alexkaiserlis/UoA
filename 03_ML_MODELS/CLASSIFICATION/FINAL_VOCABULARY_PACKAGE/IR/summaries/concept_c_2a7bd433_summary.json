  "summary": "Blended finance is a strategic approach within EU finance aimed at mobilizing private capital for sustainable development initiatives. It combines public and private funding sources to enhance investment in projects that align with EU regulatory frameworks and policy objectives. By leveraging concessional finance, blended finance mitigates risks and attracts additional investments, thereby fostering innovation and economic growth. This concept is crucial for achieving the EU's climate and sustainability goals, as it facilitates the financing of projects that may otherwise lack sufficient funding. As a redirect term, \"blending\" refers to the broader practice of integrating various financing sources, with \"blended finance\" being the preferred terminology in EU contexts.",
