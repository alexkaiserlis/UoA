  "summary": "Trade cooperation within the EU framework encompasses agreements aimed at enhancing interdependence among member states and external partners, such as Mercosur and ASEAN. These agreements facilitate trade by liberalising tariffs and regulations, thus boosting economic ties. The EU employs mechanisms like the Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) program and the Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) system to streamline processes. Additionally, trade cooperation often involves subcontracting arrangements and the supervision of insurers to ensure compliance. By consolidating efforts with industrialised nations and regions like Australasia, the EU seeks to endow its members with competitive advantages, while addressing diverse challenges, including racial and provincial disparities.",
