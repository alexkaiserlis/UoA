  "summary": "A \"post-election pact,\" often referred to as a \"political coalition,\" is a strategic agreement formed among political parties following electoral outcomes within the EU framework. This coalition aims to establish a stable governance structure, facilitating the enactment of legislative agendas and policy initiatives. Such pacts are crucial in parliamentary systems where no single party achieves an outright majority, necessitating collaboration to ensure effective governance. The legal implications of these coalitions are significant, as they influence the formation of government, allocation of ministerial positions, and the overall political landscape within EU member states. Thus, understanding political coalitions is essential for comprehending EU political dynamics.",
