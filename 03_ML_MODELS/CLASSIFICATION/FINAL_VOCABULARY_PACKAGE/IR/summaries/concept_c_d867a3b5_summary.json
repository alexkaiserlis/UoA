  "summary": "Urban migration refers to the movement of populations from rural to urban areas, a phenomenon increasingly relevant in EU legal and regulatory frameworks. This concept intersects with various policies, including those addressing social integration, housing, and labor market dynamics. The EU recognizes urban migration as a critical factor influencing demographic trends and economic development. Legal instruments, such as the European Social Fund, aim to support regions experiencing significant urban migration by promoting sustainable urban development and enhancing social cohesion. Understanding urban migration is essential for policymakers to address challenges related to infrastructure, public services, and community integration within urban environments.",
