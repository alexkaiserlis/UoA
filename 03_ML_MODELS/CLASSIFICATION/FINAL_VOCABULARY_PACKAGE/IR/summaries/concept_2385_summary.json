  "summary": "A \"cycle track\" refers to a designated pathway specifically designed for the exclusive use of cyclists, ensuring safe and efficient land transport within urban and rural environments. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, cycle tracks are integral to promoting sustainable mobility and reducing vehicular congestion. The establishment and maintenance of cycle tracks are often governed by national and local regulations, which align with EU directives aimed at enhancing transport infrastructure. These provisions support the European Green Deal's objectives by encouraging cycling as a viable alternative to motorized transport, thereby contributing to environmental sustainability and public health.",
