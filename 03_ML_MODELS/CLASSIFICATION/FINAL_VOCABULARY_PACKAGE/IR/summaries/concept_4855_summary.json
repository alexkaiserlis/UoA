  "summary": "The concept of \"financial requirements\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the stipulations governing the fiscal obligations that entities must adhere to in various contexts, including funding, compliance, and operational sustainability. These requirements are crucial for ensuring that financial institutions and businesses maintain adequate capital reserves, adhere to prudential regulations, and fulfill their obligations to stakeholders. In the context of EU legislation, such as the Capital Requirements Directive, financial requirements serve to mitigate systemic risks and enhance the stability of the financial market. Compliance with these requirements is essential for fostering trust and accountability in the EU's economic landscape.",
