  "summary": "The concept of \"pay freeze\" refers to a temporary halt on salary increases for personnel within the EU's regulatory framework. This measure is often implemented during periods of economic austerity or budgetary constraints, impacting staff remuneration policies across various EU institutions. A pay freeze can affect collective bargaining agreements and may lead to disputes regarding personnel management practices. In the context of EU law, such measures must align with principles of transparency and fairness, ensuring that they do not disproportionately affect specific groups of employees. Overall, a pay freeze serves as a strategic tool for financial management in public sector employment.",
