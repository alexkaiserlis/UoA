  "summary": "Water policy within the European Union encompasses a comprehensive framework aimed at sustainable water management, ensuring the protection of aquatic ecosystems and the promotion of water quality. This policy is guided by various legal instruments, including the Water Framework Directive, which establishes standards for water bodies and sets objectives for achieving good ecological status. The EU's water policy also addresses issues such as water scarcity, pollution control, and the equitable distribution of water resources. By integrating environmental considerations into sectoral policies, the EU seeks to foster a holistic approach to water governance, enhancing both environmental protection and public health.",
