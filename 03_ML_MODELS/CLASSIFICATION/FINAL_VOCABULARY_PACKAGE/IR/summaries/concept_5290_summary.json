  "summary": "The term \"xenon,\" categorized under chemistry, is a redirect to the preferred term \"rare gas.\" In EU legal and regulatory contexts, rare gases like xenon are often discussed in relation to their applications in various sectors, including specialized industries. Regulatory frameworks may inform firms about the use of rare gases, ensuring compliance with safety standards. The peculiar properties of xenon, akin to those of argon, can accrue benefits for employees in sectors experiencing expansion. However, the use of these gases must not threaten public health or create undue incompatibility with existing regulations. Thus, monitoring and notification processes are essential for maintaining safety and justifying their use abroad.",
