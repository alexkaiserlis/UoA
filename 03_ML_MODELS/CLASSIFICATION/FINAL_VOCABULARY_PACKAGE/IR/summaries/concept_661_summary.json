  "summary": "The term \"unofficial economy,\" which redirects to \"underground economy,\" refers to economic activities that occur outside formal regulatory frameworks, often evading taxation and oversight. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, the underground economy poses significant challenges for member states, undermining fiscal integrity and complicating economic policy enforcement. It encompasses various illicit transactions, including unregistered labor and undeclared income, which can distort market competition and hinder economic growth. Addressing the underground economy is crucial for enhancing transparency, ensuring compliance with EU regulations, and fostering a level playing field within the internal market.",
