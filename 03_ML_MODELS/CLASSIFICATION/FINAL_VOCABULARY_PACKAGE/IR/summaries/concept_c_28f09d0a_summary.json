  "summary": "The concept of \"self-production,\" commonly referred to as \"prosumer\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, pertains to individuals or entities that both produce and consume energy, particularly renewable energy. This dual role is increasingly recognized in EU legislation aimed at promoting sustainable consumption and energy efficiency. The prosumer model empowers citizens to engage actively in energy markets, fostering decentralization and enhancing energy security. Regulatory measures, such as the Clean Energy for All Europeans package, support the integration of prosumers into the energy system, facilitating their rights and responsibilities. This concept underscores the EU's commitment to a sustainable and participatory energy transition.",
