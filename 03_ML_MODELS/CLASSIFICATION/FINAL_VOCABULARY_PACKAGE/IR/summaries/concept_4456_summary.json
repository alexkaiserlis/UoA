  "summary": "The term \"thesis\" in the context of EU legal and regulatory documents refers to a formal written discourse that presents an argument or proposition, typically in the context of academic research or legal scholarship. Theses often serve as foundational documentation for the development of legal theories or regulatory frameworks within the European Union. They may analyze existing legislation, propose amendments, or critique legal principles, thereby contributing to the broader discourse on EU law. While not a primary regulatory instrument, a thesis can influence policy-making and legislative processes by providing in-depth analysis and recommendations based on rigorous research.",
