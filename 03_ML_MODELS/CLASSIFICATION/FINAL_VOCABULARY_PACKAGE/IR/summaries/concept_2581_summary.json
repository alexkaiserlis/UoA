  "summary": "The concept of \"power to negotiate\" within the EU legal framework refers to the authority granted to designated bodies, such as Europol, to engage in negotiations with third parties. This power is crucial for establishing effective operational agreements aimed at combatting organised criminality and enhancing police cooperation. The negotiations often involve authorising the transmission of personal data and laying down rules for data receipt and use. These agreements, which may require amending existing conventions, are governed by specific articles that outline the requirements for participation. The establishment of such relations is vital for ensuring that the EU can effectively address external security challenges.",
