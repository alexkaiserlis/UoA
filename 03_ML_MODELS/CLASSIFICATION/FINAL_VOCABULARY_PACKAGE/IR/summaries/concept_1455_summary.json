  "summary": "The term \"UN specialised agency\" refers to organizations within the United Nations system that are legally mandated to address specific global issues, such as disarmament and trafficking in arms. These agencies convene biennial meetings to discuss initiatives aimed at preventing the accumulation of illicit stockpiles of weapons and ammunition. The EU actively cooperates with these agencies, encouraging complementary approaches to combat the surpluses of conventional arms. Through successful conferences and timely declarations, the UN emphasises the importance of reliable tracing and marking of weapons. The EUâ€™s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) supports these efforts, identifying strategies to eradicate illicit trafficking and enhance global security.",
