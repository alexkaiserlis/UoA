  "summary": "The concept of \"film production\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses various aspects of creating and distributing films, including studios, cinemas, and the dubbing of titles in multiple languages. This sector is governed by regulations that aim to liberalise and consolidate the film industry, addressing issues such as quotas and the exploitation of films across borders. The attainment of professional standards is crucial, as is the freedom to export films, which poses challenges that must be solved satisfactorily. The EU supports bilateral agreements to enhance the distribution of films, ensuring that cultural diversity is preserved while progressively abolishing restrictions that distort market dynamics.",
