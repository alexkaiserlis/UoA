  "summary": "The concept of \"neo-Nazism,\" which is redirected to the preferred term \"National Socialism,\" encompasses ideologies that promote extreme nationalist and fascist beliefs, often characterized by racism and anti-Semitism. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the European Union actively combats the resurgence of such ideologies through various legislative measures aimed at protecting human rights and promoting social cohesion. The EU's commitment to democratic values necessitates vigilance against any manifestations of National Socialism, ensuring that member states uphold principles that reject hate speech and discrimination. This regulatory approach is essential for maintaining a stable and inclusive political framework within the Union.",
