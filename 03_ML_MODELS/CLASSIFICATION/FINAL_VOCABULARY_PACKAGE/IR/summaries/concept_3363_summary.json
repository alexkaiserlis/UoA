  "summary": "The concept of \"union representative\" pertains to individuals elected or appointed to represent the interests of employed workers within a union framework, particularly in the context of EU labour law and labour relations. These representatives play a crucial role in ensuring that workers' rights are respected and that they enjoy equal treatment in the workplace. The eligibility and rights of union representatives are specified in various EU regulations and treaties, including provisions amending earlier directives. Their function relates to the administration of trade and social policies, facilitating the movement of nationals across member states while safeguarding their rights within the European Community. The European Parliament and Council often engage in discussions to enhance the role of union representatives, reflecting the ongoing commitment to uphold workers' rights within the EU territory.",
