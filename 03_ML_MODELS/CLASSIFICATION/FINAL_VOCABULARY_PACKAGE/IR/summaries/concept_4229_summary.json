  "summary": "The term \"sub-proletariat\" refers to a socio-economic class characterized by precarious employment and limited access to resources, often existing beneath the traditional proletariat. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the sub-proletariat is significant for discussions on social inclusion, labor rights, and economic disparity. The EU aims to address the challenges faced by this group through various policies, including the European Social Fund and initiatives promoting social cohesion. Understanding the sub-proletariat is essential for developing effective regulations that foster equitable opportunities and protect vulnerable populations within the EU's social framework.",
