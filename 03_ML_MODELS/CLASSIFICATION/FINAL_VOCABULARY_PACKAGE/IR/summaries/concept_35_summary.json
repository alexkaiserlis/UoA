  "summary": "The concept of \"administrative powers\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to the authority exercised by competent authorities to implement and enforce decisions, agreements, and obligations. These powers are crucial for the recognition and enforcement of judgments across member states, ensuring cooperation in matters such as matrimonial and parental responsibilities. The mechanisms established under various protocols, including those listed in annexes, enable the effective exercise of these powers while respecting the principles of jurisdiction and control. Administrative powers are subject to applicable law and may involve repealing previous decisions to satisfy evolving legal requirements, thereby maintaining a unified legal position across the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, Ireland, and Finland.",
