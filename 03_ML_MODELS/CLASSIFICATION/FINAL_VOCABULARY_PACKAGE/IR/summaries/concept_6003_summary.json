  "summary": "The concept of \"upper class\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to a socio-economic stratum characterized by significant wealth, privilege, and influence. This demographic often plays a pivotal role in shaping policy and governance, impacting social cohesion and equity. The upper class's interests may intersect with various EU initiatives aimed at addressing social disparities, economic development, and inclusive growth. Understanding this concept is crucial for policymakers and regulators as they navigate complex socio-economic landscapes, ensuring that legislative measures promote fairness and mitigate the potential for socio-economic divides within the EU member states.",
