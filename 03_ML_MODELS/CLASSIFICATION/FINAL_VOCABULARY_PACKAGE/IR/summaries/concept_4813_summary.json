  "summary": "The term \"people's bank\" refers to a type of financial institution that is often established to serve the interests of the community, prioritizing public welfare over profit maximization. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, people's banks may be subject to specific regulations aimed at ensuring financial stability, consumer protection, and equitable access to credit. These institutions can play a crucial role in promoting financial inclusion, particularly in underserved regions. The European Union encourages the establishment of such banks as part of its broader strategy to foster sustainable economic development and enhance the resilience of the financial sector.",
