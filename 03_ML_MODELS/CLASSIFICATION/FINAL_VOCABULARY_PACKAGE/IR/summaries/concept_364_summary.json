  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"decree\" refers to a formal and authoritative order issued by a competent authority, often within the legislative or executive branches. Decrees are utilized to implement laws, establish regulations, or provide specific directives that have binding effects. They serve as essential instruments for ensuring compliance with EU legislation, facilitating uniformity across member states. Decrees can vary in scope and application, ranging from general provisions to specific mandates, thereby playing a crucial role in the harmonization of legal standards within the EU's multifaceted legal system.",
