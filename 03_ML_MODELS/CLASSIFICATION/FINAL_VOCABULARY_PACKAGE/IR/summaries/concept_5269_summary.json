  "summary": "Cartography, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the science and art of map-making, which plays a critical role in various sectors, including environmental management, urban planning, and transportation. Accurate cartographic representations are essential for the implementation of EU policies, such as spatial planning directives and environmental assessments. The integration of cartographic data enhances transparency and facilitates informed decision-making among stakeholders. Furthermore, cartography supports compliance with EU regulations by providing essential geographic information that underpins legislative measures, ensuring that member states adhere to established standards for land use and resource management.",
