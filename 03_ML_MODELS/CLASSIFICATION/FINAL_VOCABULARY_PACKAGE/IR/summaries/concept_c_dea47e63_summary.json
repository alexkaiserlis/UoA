  "summary": "Mechatronics is an interdisciplinary field that integrates mechanical engineering, electronics, computer science, and control engineering. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, mechatronics plays a crucial role in advancing automation and robotics, which are essential for enhancing productivity and innovation within the European Single Market. The EU recognizes the importance of mechatronics in developing standards and regulations that ensure safety, interoperability, and environmental sustainability. As mechatronic systems become increasingly prevalent in various sectors, including manufacturing and healthcare, EU legislation must adapt to address challenges related to intellectual property rights, liability, and data protection in automated environments.",
