  "summary": "The concept of \"self-improvement,\" redirected to \"personal development,\" encompasses initiatives aimed at enhancing individual capabilities and well-being within the EU's social affairs framework. This notion is pivotal in fostering social inclusion and empowerment, aligning with various EU policies that promote lifelong learning and personal growth. By prioritizing personal development, the EU seeks to address disparities in social cohesion and economic participation, thereby facilitating a more integrated society. Legal and regulatory documents often reference personal development as a fundamental aspect of social policy, emphasizing the importance of equipping citizens with the skills necessary for active participation in the labor market and community life.",
