  "summary": "In the context of EU law, \"resolution\" refers to a formal decision or expression of opinion adopted by the European Parliament or other EU institutions. Resolutions serve to articulate the EU's stance on various issues, influencing policy-making and legislative processes. They are not legally binding but carry significant political weight, often guiding the actions of member states and EU bodies. Resolutions can address a wide range of topics, including human rights, environmental concerns, and economic policies, thereby shaping the regulatory landscape within the EU. Their role is pivotal in fostering dialogue and consensus among EU institutions and stakeholders.",
