  "summary": "The \"convention of the Council of Europe,\" often redirected to the \"European convention,\" outlines fundamental principles governing international affairs, particularly in the context of human rights and legal cooperation. This framework, revisited during various sessions in Strasbourg, aims to address particularities such as corruption and parental rights, ensuring streamlined processes for member states. The convention endorses the protection of wildlife and vertebrate species, while also facilitating the renegotiation of treaties that impact matrimonial rights and the accommodation of diverse cultural expectations. By fostering collaboration among nations, it stabilises relationships and promotes the full participation of all addressees, including those from regions like Palestine and Haiti.",
