  "summary": "The concept of \"communications systems\" encompasses a range of technologies and regulatory frameworks essential for effective telecommunication within the EU. This includes radionavigation systems like Loran and Decca, which are vital for aeronautical and maritime navigation, as well as cellular technologies such as GSM and LTE. The EU's regulatory bodies, including CEPT and ETSI, facilitate the coexistence of various communication methods, ensuring efficient spectrum use. Legal frameworks govern aspects like numbering, portability, and the unauthorized tampering of signals. Notably, systems like DVB and UMTS enhance broadcasting capabilities, while initiatives like Fiscalis and SIRENE support cross-border communication among coastguard and law enforcement agencies.",
