  "summary": "The concept of \"social sciences\" encompasses a range of disciplines that study human behavior, societal structures, and cultural dynamics. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, social sciences play a critical role in informing policy development and implementation. They provide empirical evidence and theoretical insights that guide legislative actions, particularly in areas such as social justice, public health, and education. By integrating findings from social sciences, EU institutions can enhance their understanding of complex societal issues, ensuring that regulations are both effective and equitable. This multidisciplinary approach is essential for fostering informed decision-making within the EU's diverse legal landscape.",
