  "summary": "The \"holistic approach\" in EU legal and regulatory contexts refers to a comprehensive strategy that integrates various dimensions of policy management. This methodology emphasizes the interconnectivity of social, economic, and environmental factors, ensuring that legislation is not developed in isolation. By adopting a holistic approach, EU institutions aim to enhance coherence across different policy areas, facilitating sustainable development and effective governance. This concept is crucial in areas such as environmental law, where multifaceted challenges require coordinated responses. Ultimately, the holistic approach seeks to optimize regulatory frameworks, promoting synergy and reducing fragmentation in EU policy implementation.",
