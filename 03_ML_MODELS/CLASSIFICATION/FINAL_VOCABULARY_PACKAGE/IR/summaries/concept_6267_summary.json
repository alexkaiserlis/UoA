  "summary": "The concept of \"simulation model,\" categorized under research and intellectual property, is redirected to the preferred term \"simulation.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, simulations serve as vital tools for modeling complex systems, enabling policymakers and researchers to predict outcomes and assess impacts of various legislative measures. These models facilitate the evaluation of regulatory scenarios, thereby enhancing decision-making processes. The use of simulation in research underscores its significance in intellectual property discussions, particularly regarding the protection and commercialization of innovative methodologies. Consequently, simulations are integral to fostering a robust research environment within the EU.",
