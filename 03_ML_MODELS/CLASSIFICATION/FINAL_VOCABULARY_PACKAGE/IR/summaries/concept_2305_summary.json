  "summary": "Freshwater fishing refers to the practice of catching fish in inland water bodies, which is subject to various EU legal and regulatory frameworks aimed at sustainable fisheries management. The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) establishes guidelines for the conservation of fish stocks, ensuring that freshwater ecosystems are protected while allowing for responsible fishing activities. Regulations address issues such as fishing quotas, licensing, and environmental impact assessments to promote biodiversity and prevent overfishing. The EU also collaborates with member states to implement measures that enhance the sustainability of freshwater fisheries, balancing economic interests with ecological preservation.",
