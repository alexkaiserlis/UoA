  "summary": "The term \"reconstituted product\" refers to foodstuffs that have been processed to restore their original properties after dehydration or other forms of alteration. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, reconstituted products must comply with specific standards concerning composition, labeling, and safety to ensure consumer protection. These products are often subjected to rigorous assessments under EU food safety regulations, including the General Food Law and relevant directives. The classification of reconstituted products is crucial for market transparency and consumer awareness, as it helps delineate them from other food categories, ensuring informed choices for consumers within the EU market.",
