  "summary": "The concept of \"prior deduction,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"deduction at source,\" pertains to personnel management and staff remuneration within EU legal frameworks. This regulatory mechanism involves the automatic withholding of taxes or contributions from an employee's salary before it is disbursed. By implementing deduction at source, EU member states aim to streamline tax collection processes, ensuring compliance and reducing administrative burdens for both employers and employees. This practice enhances fiscal efficiency and promotes transparency in remuneration practices, aligning with broader EU objectives of harmonizing tax regulations and improving financial governance across member states.",
