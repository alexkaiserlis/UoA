  "summary": "The term \"work code\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"labour code,\" which refers to comprehensive legal frameworks governing labour law and labour relations within the European Union. A labour code typically encompasses regulations concerning employment contracts, workers' rights, workplace safety, and dispute resolution mechanisms. These codes are essential for harmonizing national legislation with EU directives, ensuring that fundamental rights of workers are protected across member states. By establishing clear standards, labour codes facilitate fair labour practices and promote social dialogue, thereby enhancing the overall regulatory landscape of employment within the EU.",
