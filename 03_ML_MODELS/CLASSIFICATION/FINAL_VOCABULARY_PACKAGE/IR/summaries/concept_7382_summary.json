  "summary": "A \"non-contributory benefit\" refers to social protection measures provided by EU member states that do not require prior contributions from beneficiaries. These benefits are designed to ensure a minimum standard of living and support vulnerable populations, such as the unemployed, elderly, or disabled individuals. Unlike contributory benefits, which are funded through social insurance schemes, non-contributory benefits are typically financed through general taxation. The EU regulatory framework encourages member states to implement these benefits as part of their social security systems, promoting social inclusion and cohesion across the Union. Such measures are crucial for addressing poverty and ensuring equitable access to essential services.",
