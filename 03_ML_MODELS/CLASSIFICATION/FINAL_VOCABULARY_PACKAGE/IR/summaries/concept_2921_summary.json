  "summary": "Halieutic research, often redirected to \"fishery research,\" encompasses the systematic study of fish populations and their ecosystems within EU fisheries regulations. This research is critical for reexamining the abundance and density of various species, including demersal and pelagic fish, to ensure sustainable practices. It involves exploratory voyages and the use of diverse gears, such as trawl and seine, to assess catch limits and the impact of fishing on marine herds. The findings inform regulatory frameworks, addressing limitations and promoting profitability while considering the ecological balance. Additionally, it plays a role in managing outbreaks of epizootic diseases that may affect fish stocks, ensuring the exportation of healthy products.",
