  "summary": "The concept of \"institutional activity\" within the EU context encompasses the structured actions undertaken by various EU bodies, including the appointment of interpreters and translators to facilitate communication across the Unionâ€™s diverse linguistic landscape. This activity is crucial for the effective representation of member states, such as Ireland, Slovakia, and Malta, in the formulation of treaties and proposals. Yearly adjustments and recruiting of experts ensure that the composition of these institutions remains aligned with the principles of justice and equality. Furthermore, the activities are bound by legal frameworks that govern the translation of judgments and the introduction of new acts, thereby enhancing the functioning of the enlarged society.",
