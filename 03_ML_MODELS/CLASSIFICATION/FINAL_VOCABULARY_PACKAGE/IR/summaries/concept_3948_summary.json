  "summary": "Customs fraud refers to unlawful activities that mislead customs authorities, thereby undermining tariff policy and regulations within the EU. This includes the circumvention of duties through practices such as transhipment and the use of counterfeit goods. Such actions can impede legitimate trade by diluting market integrity and depriving lawful owners of their rights. Allegations of customs fraud often arise from misleading declarations or the blending of goods to evade tariffs. The EU employs deterrent measures, including remedial actions and hearings, to discourage these practices. Ultimately, customs fraud poses injurious effects on both the economy and travellers, necessitating strict compliance with regulations like TARIC.",
