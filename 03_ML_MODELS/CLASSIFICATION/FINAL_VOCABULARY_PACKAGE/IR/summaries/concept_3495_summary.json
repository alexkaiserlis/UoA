  "summary": "The concept of \"occupied territory\" is crucial in the context of international security and EU legal frameworks, particularly concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The EU consistently recognises the complexities of administering occupied regions, such as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, where perspectives on peace and stability are recurrent. Legal documents often reference the need for timetables and grants to foster development in these areas, while also addressing the implications of subsidies and loans. The EU's approach includes offering support to Palestinian providers and ensuring that any borrowing is aligned with the principles of peace, thereby extending its commitment to a sustainable resolution in the Mediterranean region.",
