  "summary": "The concept of \"investment support,\" redirected to \"investment promotion,\" encompasses EU regulatory frameworks aimed at empowering economic growth through financing mechanisms. This support is paramount for realizing productive investments, particularly in sectors such as winegrowing and manufacturing factories. By tapping into various funding sources, including repayable borrowings, the EU seeks to boost creditworthiness and liquidity for businesses, especially during economic downturns. However, the effectiveness of these measures can be unevenly distributed, influenced by regional performances and the ability of managers to rationalise resources. Ultimately, investment promotion aims to stimulate an upturn in economic activity, ensuring that borrowed funds are utilized efficiently and effectively.",
