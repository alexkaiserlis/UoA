  "summary": "An \"institutional agreement\" in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to a formal understanding between EU institutions, such as the European Parliament, the Council, and the European Commission. These agreements are pivotal for delineating roles, responsibilities, and procedural norms, thereby enhancing cooperation and ensuring effective governance within the EU. They often address matters of legislative procedures, budgetary allocations, and inter-institutional relations, fostering transparency and accountability. Institutional agreements are essential for harmonizing the functioning of EU bodies, facilitating the implementation of policies, and ensuring compliance with the overarching legal framework of the Union.",
