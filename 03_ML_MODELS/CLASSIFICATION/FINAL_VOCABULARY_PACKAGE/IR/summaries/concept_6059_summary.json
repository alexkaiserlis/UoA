  "summary": "The \"scientific committee (EU)\" refers to expert bodies established to provide independent scientific advice on various regulatory matters, including microbiology, ecotoxicology, and preventive health measures. These committees, such as those evaluating the morphology of microbes or assessing the physiological impacts of substances, play a crucial role in the EU's regulatory framework. They consist of rapporteurs and scientists who analyze data and experimentation results, ensuring informed decision-making. Predecessors of current committees, like those led by figures such as Edouard and Klaus, have shaped their independence. Their work influences policies on health, safety, and environmental protection, addressing complex issues like parasites and prophylaxis.",
