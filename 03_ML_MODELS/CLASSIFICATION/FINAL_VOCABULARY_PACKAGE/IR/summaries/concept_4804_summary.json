  "summary": "The concept of \"suburban area\" pertains to regions situated on the periphery of urban centers, characterized by a blend of residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, suburban areas are significant for construction and town planning policies aimed at sustainable development. These areas often face unique challenges, including urban sprawl and infrastructure demands, necessitating regulatory measures that promote efficient land use and environmental protection. The EU encourages member states to adopt integrated planning approaches that address the specific needs of suburban areas, ensuring balanced growth and the enhancement of living conditions for residents.",
