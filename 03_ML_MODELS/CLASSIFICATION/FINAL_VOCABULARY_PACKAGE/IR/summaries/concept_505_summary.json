  "summary": "The concept of \"multiple nationality,\" commonly referred to as \"dual nationality,\" pertains to the legal status where an individual is recognized as a citizen by two or more states simultaneously. In the context of EU law, dual nationality raises complex regulatory issues, particularly concerning the rights and obligations of individuals in cross-border situations. The EU promotes the principle of free movement, which can be influenced by the implications of dual nationality on residency, voting rights, and access to social services. While EU member states maintain sovereignty over nationality laws, the interplay between national regulations and EU directives necessitates careful consideration of dual nationality's legal ramifications.",
