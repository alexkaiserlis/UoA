  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"joint committee,\" also referred to as an \"ad hoc committee,\" serves as a temporary assembly established to address specific issues or tasks that require collaborative decision-making among various stakeholders. These committees are often formed to facilitate dialogue and negotiation between the European Parliament and other institutions, ensuring that diverse perspectives are considered in the legislative process. The term \"joint committee\" is a redirect to \"ad hoc committee,\" emphasizing its temporary nature and focused mandate. Such committees play a crucial role in enhancing the efficacy of EU governance by fostering cooperation and consensus-building.",
