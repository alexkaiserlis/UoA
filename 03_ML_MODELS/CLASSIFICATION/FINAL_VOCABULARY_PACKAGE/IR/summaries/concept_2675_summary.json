  "summary": "The concept of \"single price,\" also referred to as \"imposed price,\" is significant in EU legal and regulatory frameworks concerning market pricing mechanisms. An imposed price represents a fixed price set by regulatory authorities, often to ensure fairness and transparency in markets, particularly in sectors like utilities and public services. This regulatory approach aims to prevent price discrimination and promote equitable access for consumers. The term \"single price\" is a redirect to \"imposed price,\" highlighting its function in maintaining stable pricing structures within the EU's internal market, thereby fostering competition and protecting consumer rights.",
