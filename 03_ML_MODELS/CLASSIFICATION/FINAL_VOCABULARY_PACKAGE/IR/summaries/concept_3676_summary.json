  "summary": "The Contadora Group, categorized under extra-European organisations, was established in the 1980s to mediate peace processes in Central America, particularly addressing conflicts in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Comprising several Latin American nations, the Group aimed to foster dialogue and promote regional stability. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the Contadora Group's efforts exemplify the EU's commitment to multilateral diplomacy and conflict resolution. Although not a formal EU entity, its initiatives resonate with the EU's foreign policy objectives, emphasizing cooperation and the promotion of democratic governance in third countries, thereby influencing EU external relations.",
