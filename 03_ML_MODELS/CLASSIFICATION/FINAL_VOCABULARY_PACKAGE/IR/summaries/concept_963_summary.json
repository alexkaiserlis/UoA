  "summary": "The concept of \"owner farming\" refers to a specific farming system where landowners actively engage in agricultural production on their own properties. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, owner farming is significant for its implications on land use policies, agricultural subsidies, and rural development initiatives. The EU promotes sustainable agricultural practices, and owner farming can contribute to biodiversity and environmental stewardship. Legal documents may address issues such as land tenure, property rights, and compliance with EU agricultural regulations. Understanding owner farming is essential for assessing its role in achieving the EU's broader agricultural and environmental objectives.",
