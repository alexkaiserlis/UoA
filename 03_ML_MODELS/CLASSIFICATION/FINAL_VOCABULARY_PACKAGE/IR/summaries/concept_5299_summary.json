  "summary": "The concept of \"atomic nucleus,\" redirected to the preferred term \"atom,\" is pivotal in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks concerning natural and applied sciences. The atomic structure, composed of protons and neutrons, is fundamental for understanding materials and their properties. Experts in fields such as electron microscopy, including notable manufacturers like Zeiss and Siemens, utilize advanced apparatus to examine atomic structures. In educational settings, research involving polymeric materials and their atomic configurations is essential for innovation. Regulatory representatives must invoke precise definitions and resolutions to ensure compliance in the importation and manufacturing of related scientific equipment, thus fostering cultural and scientific advancement across member states.",
