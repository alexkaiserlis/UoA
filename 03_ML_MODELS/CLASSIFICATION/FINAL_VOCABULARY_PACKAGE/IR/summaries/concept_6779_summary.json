The European Union has established regulations aimed at combating malware, emphasizing the need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect data processing and information technology infrastructure. Understanding the implications of malware, including worms, is crucial for compliance with EU directives, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Cybersecurity Act, which mandate the safeguarding of personal and sensitive data against such threats.",
