  "summary": "The concept of \"industrial structures\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the invaluable interdependence of various industries and their growth dynamics. It examines the extensive relations among branches of business, revealing discrepancies and gaps that may hinder progress. Through coordinated policies and recommendations, the EU aims to fill these gaps and address disturbances in industrial cycles. Monthly statistics and studies compile data on trends and regression, providing a coherent basis for formulating valid definitions and suggestions. This analysis is crucial for understanding the conjunctural tasks entrusted to regulatory bodies, ensuring that competing industries can thrive in a balanced environment.",
