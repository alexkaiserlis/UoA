  "summary": "The concept of \"older worker\" pertains to individuals in the labour market who are typically aged 55 and above. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this demographic faces unique challenges, including age discrimination and barriers to employment. The EU has implemented various directives aimed at promoting equal opportunities and combating discrimination based on age. These initiatives seek to enhance the employability of older workers, ensuring their integration into the workforce and addressing issues such as skills mismatch and retirement age policies. The recognition of older workers is crucial for fostering an inclusive labour market that values diverse age groups.",
