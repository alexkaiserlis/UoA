  "summary": "Zirconium, classified under the category of non-ferrous metals, plays a significant role in various EU legal and regulatory frameworks concerning metal industries. This versatile element is utilized in foundries for producing fusible alloys and in the manufacturing of antiperspirants, where its properties aid in dispersing active ingredients. Regulatory bodies monitor zirconium's application, particularly in relation to its eutectic behavior and potential environmental impacts, such as miasteczko contamination. The metal's involvement in the production of hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) and its derivatives necessitates compliance with stringent EU directives. As a redirect to \"non-ferrous metal,\" zirconium underscores the importance of calibrated regulations in the broader context of metal industries, including the management of scraps and the safe handling of materials in conduits and taps.",
