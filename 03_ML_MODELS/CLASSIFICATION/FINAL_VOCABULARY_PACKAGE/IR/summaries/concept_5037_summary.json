  "summary": "North Brabant, a region in the Netherlands, plays a significant role in EU regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning economic and social cohesion. The region is eligible for funding under the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), which aim to address redundancies and support reintegration of the labour force affected by globalisation. The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) classification includes North Brabant, facilitating the mobilisation of resources and appropriations for development. Statutory frameworks propose measures to evaluate and modify programming, ensuring that the region's unique perspectives are considered in broader EU policies, thereby satisfying the need for additionality and effective indexation of funds.",
