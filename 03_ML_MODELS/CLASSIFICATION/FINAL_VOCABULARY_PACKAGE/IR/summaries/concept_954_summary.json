  "summary": "The term \"extreme right\" refers to a political ideology often characterized by nationalist, xenophobic, and authoritarian principles. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, extreme right political parties may pose challenges to democratic values and the rule of law. These parties can influence electoral processes and public policy, raising concerns about their impact on social cohesion and minority rights. The EU monitors the activities of such parties to ensure compliance with fundamental rights and democratic standards. Understanding the implications of extreme right movements is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the EU's political landscape and upholding its foundational principles.",
