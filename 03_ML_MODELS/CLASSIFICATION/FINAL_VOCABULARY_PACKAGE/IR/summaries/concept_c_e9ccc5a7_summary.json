  "summary": "Heraldry, categorized under culture and religion within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, pertains to the study and design of coats of arms and emblems. This concept plays a significant role in the identification and representation of entities, including states, regions, and organizations, often enshrined in legal statutes and cultural heritage policies. In the EU context, heraldry is not merely an artistic expression but also a regulatory tool that can signify authority, legitimacy, and historical continuity. The preservation and regulation of heraldic symbols are essential for maintaining cultural identity and fostering respect for historical traditions across member states.",
