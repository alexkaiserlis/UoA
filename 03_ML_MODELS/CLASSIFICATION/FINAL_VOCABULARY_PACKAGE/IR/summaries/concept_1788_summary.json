  "summary": "The concept of \"agricultural market\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses the complex interplay of policies aimed at stabilizing and regulating agricultural productions. This includes interventions to avert market disturbances and ensure the viability of various crops, such as sunflower and colza. The EU employs mechanisms to manage the supply of products, including spirits and liqueurs, which may involve the forfeiture of unlawful goods or the replanting of affected crops. Particularities of the market, such as the labeling of aerated and sparkling beverages, are governed by strict regulations to maintain quality and consumer trust. The overarching goal is to protect farmers from sudden market shifts while promoting sustainable practices, thus ensuring that the agricultural sector remains resilient against external pressures, including those from the USA and other global markets.",
