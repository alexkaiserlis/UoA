  "summary": "Restorative justice is a legal framework within the EU that emphasizes repairing the harm caused by criminal behavior through inclusive processes. It seeks to involve all stakeholders, including victims, offenders, and the community, fostering dialogue and understanding. This approach contrasts with traditional punitive systems, aiming instead for rehabilitation and reconciliation. The EU has recognized restorative justice as a vital component of effective justice systems, promoting its integration into national legislation and practices. By prioritizing healing over retribution, restorative justice aligns with broader EU values of human rights and social cohesion, enhancing overall justice delivery across member states.",
