  "summary": "The concept of \"environmental offence\" within EU criminal law pertains to actions that recklessly violate environmental regulations, leading to pollution and degradation of natural resources. Offences may include illicit discharges by polluters, such as cargo from ships, which can result in significant deterioration of coastal ecosystems. The EU aims to dissuade such behaviour through proportionate sanctions and reinforced liability for offenders. Jurisdictional applicability varies, but repeated infringements can lead to strengthened penalties. The Charter obliges member states to ensure effective transposition of these regulations, illustrating a commitment to combat environmental violations and protect societies from the adverse effects of pollution.",
