  "summary": "The \"cost of credit,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"cost of borrowing,\" refers to the total expenses incurred by a borrower when obtaining a loan. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept encompasses interest rates, fees, and other charges associated with credit agreements. The European Union has established regulations to ensure transparency and protect consumers by mandating clear disclosure of these costs. This is crucial for fostering informed decision-making among borrowers and promoting fair competition among financial institutions. Understanding the cost of borrowing is essential for compliance with EU directives aimed at enhancing consumer rights in financial transactions.",
