  "summary": "\"Inter-Community migration,\" redirected to \"Community migration,\" refers to the movement of nationals within EU member states, governed by provisions that promote the freedom of movement and residence. This concept is rooted in the abolition of restrictions on workers and their families, allowing them to pursue employment and activities across borders. The applicable directives ensure that individuals can move without unjustified grounds for denial, thereby enhancing social security and public health rights. Consequently, the EU ordains rules that conform to the principles of equality and non-discrimination, ensuring that all persons enjoy the privileges accorded to them under EU law.",
