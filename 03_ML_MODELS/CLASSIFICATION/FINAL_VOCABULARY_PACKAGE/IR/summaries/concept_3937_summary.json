  "summary": "Time-sharing, within the context of EU civil law, refers to a legal arrangement that allows multiple parties to share the use of a property, typically for recreational purposes, such as holiday homes or resorts. This concept is governed by various EU regulations aimed at protecting consumers' rights, ensuring transparency in contracts, and regulating the obligations of providers. Time-sharing agreements must comply with the Directive 2008/122/EC on the protection of consumers in respect of certain aspects of timeshare, long-term holiday products, and resale services. This regulatory framework seeks to harmonize practices across member states, safeguarding the interests of consumers engaged in time-sharing transactions.",
