It encompasses a range of portable weapons that can be used by individuals or small groups, including firearms and light artillery. The term \"small arms\" serves as the preferred designation, reflecting its common usage in policy discussions and legislative texts. The EU actively regulates SALW through various directives and initiatives aimed at enhancing security, preventing illicit trafficking, and promoting disarmament. This regulatory focus underscores the EU's commitment to addressing the challenges posed by the proliferation of these weapons in conflict and post-conflict scenarios.",
