  "summary": "The term \"federal chamber\" refers to a legislative body within a federal system, typically representing the interests of various states or regions. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such a chamber may play a crucial role in the legislative process, particularly in matters that require regional representation. Unlike the European Parliament, which operates on a supranational level, a federal chamber emphasizes the federal structure of governance, ensuring that diverse regional interests are considered in decision-making. This concept is pivotal in understanding the dynamics of power distribution and legislative authority within the EU's multi-layered governance system.",
