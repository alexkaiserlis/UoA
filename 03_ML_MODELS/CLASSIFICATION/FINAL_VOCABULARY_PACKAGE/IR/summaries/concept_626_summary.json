  "summary": "The concept of \"lighting\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses the standards and directives related to luminaires and their technical specifications. This includes the adaptation of laws and measures aimed at the elimination of barriers to trade in the lighting sector. The European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) plays a crucial role in updating and producing standards that simplify compliance with requirements. Directives relating to lighting address issues such as fluorescent lighting and interference from radio apparatus. The last amendments, drawn from experience in the field, reflect progress in the approximation of technical requirements across communities, ensuring safety and efficiency in lighting applications.",
