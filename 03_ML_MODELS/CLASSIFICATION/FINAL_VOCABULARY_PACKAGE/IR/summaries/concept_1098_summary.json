  "summary": "The concept of \"truancy,\" categorized under the organisation of teaching, is redirected to the preferred term \"school attendance.\" In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, school attendance is crucial for ensuring educational rights and promoting social inclusion. Truancy, defined as the unauthorized absence from school, poses challenges to educational institutions and policymakers, necessitating effective strategies to enhance attendance rates. The EU emphasizes the importance of attendance in fostering equal opportunities for all students, thereby aligning educational policies with broader social objectives. Addressing truancy through regulatory measures is essential for improving educational outcomes and supporting the overall development of young individuals within the EU.",
