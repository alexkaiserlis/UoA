  "summary": "The term \"ore-reducing process\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"ore processing,\" which encompasses various methods employed in the coal and mining industries to extract valuable minerals from ores. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, ore processing is subject to stringent environmental and safety regulations aimed at minimizing ecological impact and ensuring worker protection. The European Union's directives on mining operations emphasize sustainable practices, requiring operators to adhere to best practices in ore processing. This ensures compliance with both environmental standards and the promotion of resource efficiency within the coal and mining sectors.",
