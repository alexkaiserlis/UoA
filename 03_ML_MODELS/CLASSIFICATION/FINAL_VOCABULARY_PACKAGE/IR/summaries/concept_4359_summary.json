  "summary": "The \"on-line system,\" a redirect to the preferred term \"information system,\" plays a crucial role in EU legal and regulatory frameworks. These systems function as bureaucratic tools for managing vast data interdependencies, ensuring compliance with liabilities and minimizing contraventions. They facilitate advancements in usability and synchronicity, allowing for efficient processing of information. In the context of globalised operations, such systems are vital for tracking entities like forwarders and managing data on aliens and translocations. The integration of disclaimers and backup protocols enhances reliability, while the systems' design must accommodate everyday needs and specific requirements, such as those outlined in regulations like VDR and LRIT.",
