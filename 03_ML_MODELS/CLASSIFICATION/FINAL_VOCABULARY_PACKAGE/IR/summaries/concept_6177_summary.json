  "summary": "The concept of \"intranet\" refers to a private network that utilizes internet protocols to facilitate communication and information sharing within an organization, particularly in the context of EU institutions. In regulatory frameworks, intranets are essential for ensuring secure and efficient internal communications, enabling compliance with data protection regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). They serve as platforms for disseminating legal documents, policy updates, and operational guidelines, thereby enhancing transparency and accessibility within the EU's administrative structure. The effective use of intranets can significantly improve workflow and collaboration among various EU bodies, contributing to a more integrated and responsive governance system.",
