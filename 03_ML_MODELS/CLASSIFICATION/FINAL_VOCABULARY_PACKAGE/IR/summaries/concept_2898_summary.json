  "summary": "The \"approximation of policies\" in the EU context refers to the gradual harmonization of laws and regulations among Member States to ensure a cohesive legal framework. This process is essential for entities wishing to operate lawfully across borders, particularly in areas such as immigration and the movement of refugees. By aligning customs and visa regulations, the EU aims to facilitate the crossing of frontiers while keeping security concerns in mind. Such harmonized policies represent a collective endeavour to address differing national laws, ensuring that all nationals are recognized and exempt from illegal practices. The implications of this approximation are significant, as it holds the potential to enhance cooperation and communication among Member States, thereby fostering a more integrated and secure territorial environment.",
