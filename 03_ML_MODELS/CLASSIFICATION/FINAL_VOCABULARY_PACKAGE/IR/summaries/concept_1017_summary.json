  "summary": "The concept of \"municipal finances,\" redirected to the preferred term \"local authority finances,\" pertains to the financial management and budgetary policies of local government entities within the European Union. This area of public finance encompasses the revenue generation, expenditure, and fiscal accountability of municipalities, which are crucial for ensuring sustainable development and effective governance. Local authority finances are regulated under EU law to promote fiscal discipline and transparency, aligning with broader budgetary frameworks. Understanding this concept is essential for analyzing the financial autonomy of local authorities and their role in implementing EU policies at the grassroots level.",
