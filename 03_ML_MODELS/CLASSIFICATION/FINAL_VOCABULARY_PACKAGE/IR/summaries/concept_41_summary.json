  "summary": "The concept of \"regulatory autonomy,\" redirected to the preferred term \"powers of parliament,\" pertains to the authority and discretion granted to parliamentary bodies within the European Union. This autonomy enables parliaments to legislate, oversee, and influence regulatory frameworks independently, thereby ensuring democratic accountability and representation. In the context of EU legal documents, regulatory autonomy is crucial for the effective functioning of member states' parliaments, allowing them to adapt and implement EU directives while considering national interests. This balance between EU obligations and national legislative powers underscores the importance of parliamentary sovereignty in the EU's multi-level governance system.",
