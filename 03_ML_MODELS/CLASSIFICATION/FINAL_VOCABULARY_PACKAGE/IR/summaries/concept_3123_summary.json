  "summary": "Trade regulations within the EU framework encompass a multilaterally agreed set of rules governing the exchange of goods and services. These regulations address various sectors, including the aquaculture industry, where specific standards are established for buques and palangreros. The legal landscape also includes provisions for actionable measures against infringers, such as pirates who violate intellectual property rights. Additionally, trade regulations facilitate the operation of companies like Hyundai and Samsung, ensuring compliance with standards for products ranging from toiletry to perfumery. The EU's commitment to fair trade practices is reflected in its support for associations like IFPI, which protect the rights of creators and their repertoires.",
