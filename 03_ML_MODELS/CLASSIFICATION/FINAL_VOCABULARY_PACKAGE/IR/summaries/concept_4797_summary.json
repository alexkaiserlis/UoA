In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, humid zones are critical for the implementation of environmental protection directives, such as the Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive. These areas often serve as vital habitats for various flora and fauna, necessitating specific conservation measures to maintain ecological balance. The EU recognizes the importance of humid zones in combating climate change and promoting sustainable land use practices, thereby ensuring the preservation of natural environments across member states.",
