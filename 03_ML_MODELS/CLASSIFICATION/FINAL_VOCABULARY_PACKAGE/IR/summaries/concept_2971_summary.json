  "summary": "The \"physical improvement plan,\" redirected to the preferred term \"farm development plan,\" is a crucial component of EU agricultural policy aimed at addressing underdevelopment in rural areas. This plan integrates various aspects of agricultural and horticultural management, focusing on the rejuvenation of rugged landscapes and the rationalization of agricultural practices. It encourages the replantation of crops and the modernization of infrastructure, ensuring that institutions in agriculture and horticulture can effectively manage resources. By granting financial support and revising management accounts, the plan aims to foster the development of less favoured regions, promoting sustainable practices and enhancing productivity.",
