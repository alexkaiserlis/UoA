  "summary": "Local pollution refers to the degradation of environmental quality in specific geographic areas, often resulting from anthropogenic activities such as industrial emissions, agricultural runoff, and urban waste. Within the EU legal framework, local pollution is addressed through various directives aimed at mitigating its adverse effects on public health and ecosystems. The EU's regulatory instruments, such as the Ambient Air Quality Directive and the Water Framework Directive, establish standards and obligations for member states to monitor and reduce local pollution levels. Effective management of local pollution is crucial for achieving the EU's broader environmental objectives and ensuring sustainable development across regions.",
