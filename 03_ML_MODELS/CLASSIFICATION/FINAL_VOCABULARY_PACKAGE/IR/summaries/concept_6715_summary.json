  "summary": "The concept of \"science of danger,\" redirected to \"hazard science,\" pertains to the systematic study of risks associated with various natural and anthropogenic phenomena. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, hazard science plays a crucial role in risk assessment and management, particularly in environmental protection, public health, and safety regulations. It informs legislation by providing empirical data and methodologies for evaluating potential hazards, thereby aiding policymakers in developing effective strategies to mitigate risks. The integration of hazard science into EU directives ensures that member states adopt a precautionary approach, enhancing overall societal resilience against identified dangers.",
