  "summary": "The concept of \"municipal international cooperation,\" also known as \"decentralised cooperation,\" refers to collaborative efforts between local authorities across borders to address shared challenges and enhance mutual development. Within the EU legal and regulatory framework, this form of cooperation is pivotal for promoting regional integration and fostering sustainable development. It enables municipalities to engage in partnerships that leverage local resources and expertise, thereby facilitating the exchange of best practices. The EU encourages such initiatives through various funding mechanisms and policy frameworks, recognizing their importance in achieving broader cooperation policy objectives and enhancing the effectiveness of local governance in a globalized context.",
