  "summary": "The concept of \"freedom of trade\" is a fundamental principle enshrined in EU law, promoting the unobstructed exchange of goods and services across member states. This right is integral to the functioning of the internal market, ensuring that barriers to trade, such as tariffs and discriminatory practices, are eliminated. The freedom of trade is closely linked to the principles of non-discrimination and mutual recognition, fostering competition and economic integration. It underpins various EU regulations and directives aimed at harmonizing standards and facilitating cross-border commerce, thereby enhancing consumer choice and economic growth within the Union.",
