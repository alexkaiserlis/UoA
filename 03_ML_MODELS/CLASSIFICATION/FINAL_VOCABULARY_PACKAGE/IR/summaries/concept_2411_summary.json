  "summary": "The concept of \"aquatic plant\" encompasses various organisms, including species such as Pomacea insularum, which pose significant threats to watercourses and ecosystems. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the identification and regulation of aquatic plants are critical for combating the spread of harmful species. Intensive surveys and analysis are conducted to assess their presence and potential impact on demarcated regions. The movement of these organisms is often restricted to prevent their proliferation, with specific measures aimed at eradicating invasive taxa. Protective legislation may prohibit the planting of certain seeds, ensuring the sustainable management of aquatic environments and safeguarding biodiversity.",
