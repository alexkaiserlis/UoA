  "summary": "The concept of \"release on licence\" pertains to criminal law within the EU framework, signifying a conditional release of an offender from incarceration. This mechanism allows individuals to reintegrate into society under specific obligations, such as regular reporting to authorities or compliance with rehabilitation programs. The process aims to balance public safety with the rehabilitation of offenders, promoting their reintegration while maintaining oversight. In the context of EU legal instruments, \"release on licence\" reflects the broader principles of restorative justice and the rights of individuals, aligning with various directives that emphasize humane treatment and reintegration strategies within member states' criminal justice systems.",
