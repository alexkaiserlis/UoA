  "summary": "The concept of \"copyright limitation,\" also referred to as \"copyright exception,\" pertains to specific provisions within EU law that allow for the use of copyrighted material without the need for authorization from the rights holder. These exceptions are crucial for balancing the interests of copyright owners with the public's access to information and cultural works. They facilitate research, education, and innovation by permitting certain uses, such as quotation, parody, and private copying. The legal framework governing these exceptions is primarily found in the EU Copyright Directive, which aims to harmonize national laws while ensuring the protection of intellectual property rights across member states.",
