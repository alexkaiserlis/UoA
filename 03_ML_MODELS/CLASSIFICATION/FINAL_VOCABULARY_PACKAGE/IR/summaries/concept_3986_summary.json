  "summary": "The term \"international tribunal\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"international court,\" which refers to judicial bodies established to adjudicate disputes between states or individuals under international law. Within the EU legal framework, international courts play a crucial role in interpreting treaties and ensuring compliance with international obligations. They contribute to the organization of the legal system by providing mechanisms for dispute resolution and upholding human rights standards. These courts often address issues such as trade disputes, humanitarian law, and environmental regulations, thereby reinforcing the EU's commitment to a rules-based international order.",
