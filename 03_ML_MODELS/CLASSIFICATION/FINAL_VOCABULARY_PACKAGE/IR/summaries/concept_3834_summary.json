  "summary": "Antimony, categorized under the iron, steel, and other metal industries, is a metalloid with significant implications in EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Its applications range from flame retardants to alloys, necessitating compliance with various directives, including REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals). The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) monitors antimony's usage to mitigate health and environmental risks. Regulatory measures aim to ensure safe handling and minimize exposure, reflecting the EU's commitment to sustainable industrial practices. As such, antimony's regulation is pivotal in balancing industrial innovation with public health and environmental protection within the EU's legislative landscape.",
