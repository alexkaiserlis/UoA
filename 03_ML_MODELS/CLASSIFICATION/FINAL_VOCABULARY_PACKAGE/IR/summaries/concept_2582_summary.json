  "summary": "The \"power of ratification\" refers to the authority vested in certain EU institutions and member states to formally approve international treaties and agreements. This power is crucial within the political framework of the EU, as it ensures that commitments made at the international level align with the legal and regulatory standards of the Union. Ratification typically involves a thorough examination of the treaty's implications, requiring consensus among member states. Consequently, the power of ratification serves as a mechanism for maintaining the integrity of EU law and fostering cooperation among member states in the global arena.",
