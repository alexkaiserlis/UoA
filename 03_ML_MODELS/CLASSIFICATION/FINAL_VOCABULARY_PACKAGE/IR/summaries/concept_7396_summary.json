  "summary": "A \"living will,\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to an advance directive that allows individuals to express their healthcare preferences in situations where they are unable to communicate their wishes due to incapacity. This legal instrument is crucial for ensuring that patients' autonomy is respected, particularly in end-of-life scenarios. The concept is governed by various EU member states' laws, which may differ in terms of requirements and enforceability. Living wills serve to guide healthcare providers and family members, thereby facilitating informed decision-making in alignment with the patient's expressed desires regarding medical treatment.",
