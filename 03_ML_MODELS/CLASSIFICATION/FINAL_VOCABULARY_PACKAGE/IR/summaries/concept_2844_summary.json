  "summary": "Protectionism refers to economic policies implemented by states to restrict imports and promote domestic industries, often through tariffs, quotas, and subsidies. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, protectionism can conflict with the principles of the single market, which aims to ensure free movement of goods, services, capital, and labor. The EU's legal instruments, such as the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), seek to mitigate protectionist measures that could distort competition and hinder economic integration among member states. Consequently, the EU monitors and regulates protectionist practices to uphold market unity and foster fair trade.",
