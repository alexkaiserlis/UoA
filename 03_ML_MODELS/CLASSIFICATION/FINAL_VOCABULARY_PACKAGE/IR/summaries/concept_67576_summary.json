  "summary": "A \"frozen conflict\" refers to a geopolitical situation where active hostilities have ceased, yet no comprehensive peace agreement has been reached, leaving underlying tensions unresolved. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, frozen conflicts pose significant challenges for international security and stability. The EU often engages in diplomatic efforts to address these situations, promoting conflict resolution and the rule of law. Such conflicts can hinder regional cooperation, affect trade relations, and complicate the EU's foreign policy objectives. Understanding frozen conflicts is crucial for developing effective strategies to foster peace and uphold EU values in affected regions.",
