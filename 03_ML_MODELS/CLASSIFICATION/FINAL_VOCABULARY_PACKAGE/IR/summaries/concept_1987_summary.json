  "summary": "The concept of \"mountain\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to the natural environment, specifically addressing the ecological, geographical, and cultural significance of mountainous regions. Mountains are often subject to various EU directives aimed at environmental protection, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable development. These areas may be included in initiatives such as the Natura 2000 network, which aims to safeguard habitats and species. Additionally, mountains play a crucial role in regional development policies, promoting tourism and local economies while ensuring the preservation of their unique ecosystems. Thus, the legal discourse surrounding mountains is integral to achieving balanced environmental governance in the EU.",
