  "summary": "Cyber-bullying, categorized under criminal law in the EU, refers to the use of digital platforms to harass, intimidate, or harm individuals, particularly minors. This phenomenon poses significant challenges for legal frameworks, as it often transcends national boundaries, complicating jurisdictional issues. The EU has recognized the need for comprehensive regulatory measures to address cyber-bullying, emphasizing the protection of victims and the accountability of perpetrators. Initiatives such as the Digital Services Act aim to create safer online environments, while also fostering cooperation among member states to combat this form of digital violence effectively. Legal definitions and penalties for cyber-bullying vary across jurisdictions, necessitating harmonization efforts within the EU.",
