  "summary": "Market intervention within the EU trade policy framework refers to measures aimed at stabilizing markets, particularly in situations of undersupply or severe price fluctuations. These interventions can include the storage of surplus products, where processors are incentivized to store goods to manage supply levels. The process involves various stakeholders, including offerers and processors, who may need to rearrange their operations to comply with regulatory standards. Measures referred to in this context may also include the diversion of resources or curtailing production to address market imbalances. Such interventions are calculated to ensure market stability and protect the interests of consumers and producers alike, particularly during critical periods like harvests or regional crises.",
