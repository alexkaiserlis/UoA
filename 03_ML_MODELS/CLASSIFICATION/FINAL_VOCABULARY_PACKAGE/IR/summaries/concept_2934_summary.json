  "summary": "The concept of \"conversion to horticulture\" pertains to the transition of agricultural practices towards the cultivation of horticultural products within the EU's regulatory framework. This process is often guided by specific legal provisions aimed at promoting sustainable agricultural structures and enhancing production efficiency. The EU encourages conversion through various support mechanisms, including financial aid and technical assistance, to ensure compliance with environmental standards and market demands. Such initiatives are integral to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which seeks to foster innovation and resilience in the agricultural sector, thereby contributing to food security and rural development across member states.",
