  "summary": "Glaciology, a branch of natural environment studies, focuses on glaciers and their dynamics, which are critical for understanding climate change impacts. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, glaciology informs environmental protection policies, particularly those addressing climate adaptation and biodiversity conservation. The preferred term \"glacier\" encompasses the physical formations studied within glaciology, emphasizing their significance in ecological assessments and climate monitoring. As glaciers are sensitive indicators of climate fluctuations, EU legislation increasingly integrates glaciological research to formulate effective environmental strategies. This redirect highlights the importance of glaciers in the broader context of natural environment regulation within the EU.",
