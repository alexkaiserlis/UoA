  "summary": "Rearmament refers to the process of re-establishing or enhancing a state's military capabilities, often through the acquisition of new weapons systems or the modernization of existing forces. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, rearmament is closely monitored due to its implications for regional security and defense policy. The EU emphasizes cooperative defense initiatives and arms control measures to prevent escalation and promote stability among member states. Regulatory documents may address the implications of rearmament on international relations, compliance with treaties, and the balance of power within the EU, ensuring that such activities align with broader security objectives.",
