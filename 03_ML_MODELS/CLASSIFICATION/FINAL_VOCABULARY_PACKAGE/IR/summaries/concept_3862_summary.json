  "summary": "An \"administrative sanction\" within the EU legal framework refers to a regulatory measure imposed by authorities to penalise violations of administrative laws. Such sanctions can include pecuniary penalties or the disapplication of certain privileges, aimed at ensuring compliance and deterring future violations. These measures may be applied in various contexts, including telecommunications, where corporations may face sanctions for non-compliance with regulatory standards. The process is often cumbersome, requiring an expeditious referral to an auditor or regulatory body. Administrative sanctions uphold the rule of law, addressing issues such as inequality and ensuring that unspent donations are appropriately managed, thereby fostering accountability in public service.",
