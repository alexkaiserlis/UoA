  "summary": "The concept of \"public responsibility,\" categorized under politics and public safety, is closely related to the preferred term \"public office.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, public responsibility encompasses the duties and obligations that officials in public office must uphold to ensure accountability, transparency, and the rule of law. This concept is integral to maintaining public trust and safeguarding democratic governance within EU member states. As a redirect, \"public responsibility\" emphasizes the broader implications of holding a public office, where officials are expected to act in the public interest and adhere to ethical standards.",
