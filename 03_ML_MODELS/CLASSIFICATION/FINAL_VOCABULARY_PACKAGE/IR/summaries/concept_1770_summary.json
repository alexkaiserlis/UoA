  "summary": "Malnutrition, categorized under health in EU regulatory frameworks, refers to a condition resulting from an inadequate or imbalanced intake of nutrients. It encompasses both undernutrition and overnutrition, impacting public health significantly. The EU has established various directives and regulations aimed at addressing malnutrition, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. These legal instruments promote nutritional standards, food safety, and public health initiatives to combat malnutrition. Furthermore, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) plays a crucial role in assessing nutritional guidelines and ensuring compliance with health regulations, thereby fostering a holistic approach to mitigate malnutrition across member states.",
