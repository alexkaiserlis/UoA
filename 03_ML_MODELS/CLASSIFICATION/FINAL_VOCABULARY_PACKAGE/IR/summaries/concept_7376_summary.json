  "summary": "The term \"extra-parliamentary party\" refers to a political party that operates outside of the formal parliamentary system, often engaging in advocacy, grassroots mobilization, and public discourse without holding elected office. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such parties may influence policy-making through public opinion and civil society engagement. While they do not participate directly in legislative processes, their activities can shape political landscapes and electoral dynamics. Understanding the role of extra-parliamentary parties is crucial for comprehending the broader political ecosystem within the EU, particularly regarding democratic participation and representation.",
