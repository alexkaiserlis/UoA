  "summary": "A \"confederal State\" refers to a political framework characterized by a union of sovereign entities that retain significant autonomy while delegating certain powers to a central authority. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, this concept is pivotal in understanding the balance of power between member states and the European Union. Unlike a federal state, where authority is more centralized, a confederal State emphasizes cooperation and voluntary association among its constituent entities. This structure influences legislative processes, treaty negotiations, and the implementation of EU policies, reflecting the diverse governance models within the Union.",
