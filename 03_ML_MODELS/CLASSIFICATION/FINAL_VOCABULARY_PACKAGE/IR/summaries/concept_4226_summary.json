  "summary": "Self-financing refers to the capacity of an entity, such as a public body or private organization, to generate sufficient revenue to cover its own operational costs and investments without relying on external funding sources. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, self-financing is crucial for ensuring financial sustainability and independence, particularly in sectors like public services and infrastructure. This concept is often evaluated in relation to compliance with EU state aid rules, which aim to prevent distortions in competition. By promoting self-financing mechanisms, the EU encourages responsible fiscal management and supports the long-term viability of projects within its member states.",
