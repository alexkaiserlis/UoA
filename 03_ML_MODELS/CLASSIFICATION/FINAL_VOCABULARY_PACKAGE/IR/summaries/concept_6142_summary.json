  "summary": "The Treaty of Amsterdam, signed in 1997 and effective from 1999, represents a pivotal amendment to the foundational treaties of the European Union (EU). It aimed to enhance the EU's capacity for decision-making and to streamline its institutional framework. Notably, the Treaty introduced significant reforms in areas such as the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and justice and home affairs, thereby expanding the EU's competencies. Additionally, it laid the groundwork for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into EU law, reinforcing the protection of fundamental rights within the regulatory framework. The Treaty of Amsterdam thus serves as a crucial legal instrument in the evolution of EU governance.",
