  "summary": "The concept of \"political theory,\" categorized under the political framework, is a redirect to the preferred term \"political philosophy.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, political philosophy encompasses the foundational principles and ideologies that inform the governance structures and policy-making processes within the Union. It provides a critical lens through which to examine the legitimacy of EU institutions, the rule of law, and the protection of fundamental rights. Understanding political philosophy is essential for interpreting EU treaties and regulations, as it shapes the normative frameworks that guide legislative actions and the overarching objectives of European integration.",
