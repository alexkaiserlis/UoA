  "summary": "The term \"import monopoly\" refers to a market condition where a single entity holds exclusive rights to import specific goods into a jurisdiction, significantly influencing competition dynamics. Within the EU legal framework, such monopolistic practices can contravene competition law, particularly under Article 101 and Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). These articles prohibit anti-competitive agreements and abuse of dominant positions, respectively. The European Commission actively monitors and regulates import monopolies to ensure fair competition, prevent market distortion, and promote consumer welfare across member states, thus maintaining a balanced internal market.",
