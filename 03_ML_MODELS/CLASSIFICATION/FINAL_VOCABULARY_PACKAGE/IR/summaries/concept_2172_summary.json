  "summary": "The concept of \"Asian regional organization,\" categorized under extra-European organisations, is redirected to the preferred term \"Asian organisation.\" This term encompasses various multilateral entities that facilitate cooperation among Asian nations, addressing issues such as trade, security, and cultural exchange. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these organizations are significant as they often engage in partnerships with the EU, influencing policies on international relations and development aid. Understanding the dynamics of Asian organisations is crucial for EU institutions when formulating strategies that promote stability and collaboration in the Asia-Pacific region, thereby enhancing global governance.",
