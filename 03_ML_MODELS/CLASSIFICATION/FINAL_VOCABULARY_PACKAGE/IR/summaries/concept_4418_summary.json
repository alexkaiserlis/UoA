  "summary": "The concept of \"materials technology\" encompasses the development and application of various materials, including steel, iron, and hollow profiles, essential for numerous sectors within the EU. Regulatory frameworks often address the introduction of customs duties on imports, particularly for pipes and tubes originating from countries like Croatia, Slovenia, and the former Yugoslav republics. The EU may adopt preferential arrangements to exempt certain materials from tariffs, thereby facilitating trade. Surveillance measures are implemented to ensure compliance with regulations, especially when damage or serious violations occur. This evolving landscape requires continuous adaptation to new technologies and market demands, impacting the overall economic situation in the region.",
