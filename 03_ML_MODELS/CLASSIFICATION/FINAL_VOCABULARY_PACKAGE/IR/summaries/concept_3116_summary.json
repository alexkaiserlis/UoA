  "summary": "The \"driving period\" in EU transport policy refers to the defined times during which drivers operate vehicles, crucial for ensuring road safety and compliance with regulations. This concept includes specific provisions for breaks and rest periods, which are recorded using digital tachographs or driver cards. These cards facilitate the downloading of driving data, allowing for precise reporting and checks on driver activity. The harmonisation of driving periods across member states complements efforts to reduce the burden on drivers while ensuring that exceptions are clearly defined. Regular updates and the inclusion of mobile units enhance the convenience of monitoring driving periods, promoting safer road usage.",
