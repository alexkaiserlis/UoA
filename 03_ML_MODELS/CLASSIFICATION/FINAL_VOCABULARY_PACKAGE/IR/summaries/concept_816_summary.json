  "summary": "A \"joint venture\" in EU legal and regulatory contexts refers to a collaborative agreement between two or more entities to undertake specific business activities while sharing risks and rewards. This structure often involves the pooling of resources, such as technolgie and expertise, to enhance competitiveness against larger firms. For instance, companies in sectors like kernkraftwerklingen may form joint ventures to develop advanced technologies. Regulatory scrutiny ensures compliance with competition laws, preventing exclusivities that could foreclose market access for other purchasers. The cooperation can also extend to scientific and technological research, as seen in initiatives like iccti and jnict, fostering innovation in fields such as automotive and media, where firms like endemol and kpn operate.",
