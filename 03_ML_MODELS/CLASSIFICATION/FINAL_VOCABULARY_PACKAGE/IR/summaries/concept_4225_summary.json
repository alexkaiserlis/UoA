  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"agricultural by-product\" refers to materials generated during agricultural activities that can be utilized rather than disposed of, such as tallow, manure, and husked grains. These by-products can be channelled into bioenergy production, including biogas and biodiesel, through processes like hydrolysis and fermentation. The treatment of agricultural by-products is subject to regulations to mitigate risks associated with impurities and untreated materials, ensuring safe application in sectors like biotechnology and fertilisers. Additionally, by-products may be processed in distilleries or used in winemaking, contributing to a circular economy and reducing landfill reliance.",
