  "summary": "Hybrid warfare refers to a strategic approach that combines conventional military tactics with irregular methods, such as cyber attacks and disinformation campaigns, to achieve political objectives. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, hybrid warfare poses significant challenges to international security, necessitating a coordinated response among member states. The EU has developed policies to enhance resilience against such threats, focusing on cybersecurity, intelligence sharing, and legal measures to counteract disinformation. By addressing hybrid warfare, the EU aims to safeguard its democratic institutions and maintain stability within its borders, reinforcing its commitment to collective security and defense.",
