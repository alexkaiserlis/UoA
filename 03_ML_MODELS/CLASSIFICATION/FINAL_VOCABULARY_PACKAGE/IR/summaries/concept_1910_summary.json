  "summary": "The concept of \"work journey,\" classified under the category of migration, is redirected to the preferred term \"commuting\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Commuting refers to the regular travel undertaken by individuals between their residence and place of employment. This term is significant in discussions surrounding labor mobility, cross-border employment, and the socio-economic implications of migration policies. Understanding commuting patterns is essential for formulating regulations that address the rights of workers, access to employment, and the integration of migrant labor within the EU. The legal context emphasizes the importance of facilitating efficient commuting to enhance workforce participation across member states.",
