  "summary": "The concept of \"regions of Greece\" encompasses various prefectures, including Crete, Lesbos, and Evros, which exhibit unique geographical and cultural characteristics. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these regions face intrinsic handicaps stemming from remoteness and varying infrastructre levels. The emphasis on tourism and agricultural practices, such as irrigation and geothermal energy exploitation, highlights the regions' potential for economic growth. However, challenges like backlog in development and a shortfall in resources persist. The EU's facilitation of accessions and reclassification of regions aims to address these issues, promoting vigorous regional development and harmoniously integrating them into the broader EU fabric.",
