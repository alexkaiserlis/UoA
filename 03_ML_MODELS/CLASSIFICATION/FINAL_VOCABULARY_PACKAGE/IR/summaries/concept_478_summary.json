  "summary": "In the context of EU competition law, \"exclusive sales rights,\" often referred to as \"exclusive distribution agreements,\" are contractual arrangements that grant a distributor exclusive rights to market and sell specific products within a designated territory. Such agreements can be restrictive, potentially limiting competition among distributors. For instance, a jeweller may enter an exclusive agreement with a mainframe productvertrieb, thereby preventing other retailers from commercializing similar products. While these arrangements can enhance efficiency and ensure quality workmanship, they may also raise concerns about market monopolization, particularly in sectors like radiotelevisione and music, where artistes and singers rely on fair access to distribution channels. The EU regulatory framework seeks to balance these interests, ensuring that exclusive agreements do not lead to disparaging practices or market abuse.",
