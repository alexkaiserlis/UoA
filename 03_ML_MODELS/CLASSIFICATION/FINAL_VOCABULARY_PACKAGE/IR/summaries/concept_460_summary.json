  "summary": "The concept of \"price disparity\" refers to the differences in pricing for similar goods or services across various markets or regions within the EU. This phenomenon can arise from various factors, including market segmentation, regulatory frameworks, and competitive practices. In the context of EU law, price disparity is significant as it may contravene principles of the internal market, such as the free movement of goods and services. Regulatory bodies monitor price disparity to ensure fair competition and protect consumers from unjustified price variations. Addressing price disparity is crucial for promoting equitable access to goods and fostering a cohesive economic environment across member states.",
