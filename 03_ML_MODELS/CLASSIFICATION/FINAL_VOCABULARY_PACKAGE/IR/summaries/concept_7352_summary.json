  "summary": "The concept of \"rights of access\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the entitlements granted to individuals and entities to obtain information held by public authorities. This principle is crucial for ensuring transparency and accountability in governance, facilitating informed participation in democratic processes. The rights of access are enshrined in various EU directives and regulations, notably the Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on public access to European Parliament, Council, and Commission documents. These rights empower citizens to request and receive documents, thereby promoting the principles of openness and good administration, essential for the functioning of the EU's legal order.",
