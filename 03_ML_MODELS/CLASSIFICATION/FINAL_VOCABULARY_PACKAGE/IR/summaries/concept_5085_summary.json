  "summary": "The concept of \"top management,\" which is redirected to \"senior management,\" pertains to the highest level of organizational leadership within the context of the EU labour market. Senior management is responsible for strategic decision-making, ensuring compliance with EU regulations, and overseeing the implementation of policies that affect workforce dynamics. This includes adherence to directives on employment rights and corporate governance. In regulatory frameworks, senior management plays a crucial role in fostering a culture of accountability and transparency, thereby influencing the overall effectiveness of labour market policies across member states. Understanding this hierarchy is essential for navigating EU legal and regulatory landscapes.",
