  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the term \"prisoner\" refers to individuals who have been detained under criminal law provisions. The implications of their status are significant, particularly concerning the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and military operations, such as those conducted by Eufor. Agreements and protocols governing the treatment and transfer of prisoners are negotiated to ensure compliance with human rights guarantees. The adoption of detailed arrangements for their welfare is crucial, as is the role of member states, such as Denmark, in authorising actions on behalf of the EU. The implementation of these policies requires careful consideration of security and operational mandates, ensuring that all decisions align with the overarching objectives of justice and rehabilitation.",
