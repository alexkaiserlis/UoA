  "summary": "The concept of \"supplementary aid for products\" within EU agricultural policy pertains to financial support mechanisms aimed at enhancing the market stability of specific agricultural goods. This aid can assist producers, including middlemen and bottlers, in navigating fluctuating market realities. For instance, the regulation may cover products like tinned pineapples or dried figs, providing a safety net against price drops. The aid aims to neutralize the impact of imitation products and support the development of fortified goods. By simplifying the regulatory framework, the EU seeks to activate market dynamics, ensuring that valuable products, such as oryza and lupins, receive necessary backing for sustainable growth.",
