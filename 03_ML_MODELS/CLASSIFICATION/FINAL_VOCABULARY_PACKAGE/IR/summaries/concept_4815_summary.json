  "summary": "A \"public bank\" refers to a financial institution owned and operated by a government or public authority, primarily aimed at serving public interests rather than maximizing profit. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, public banks play a crucial role in financing public projects, promoting economic development, and ensuring financial stability. They are subject to specific regulations that govern their operations, including compliance with EU state aid rules and banking regulations. Public banks can facilitate access to credit for underserved sectors, thereby contributing to social and economic cohesion within the EU. Their operations are essential for achieving broader EU policy objectives, such as sustainability and regional development.",
