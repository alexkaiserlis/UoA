  "summary": "Patent law within the EU framework encompasses the legal principles governing the protection of inventions through patents, which dispenses exclusive rights to proprietors. The complexities of patent law are often instigated by issues such as obviousness and counterclaims in litigation, where defendants may be sued for infringement. The European Patent Office (EPO) plays a pivotal role in examining patent applications, while the Unitary Patent Court (UPC) furthers harmonization across member states. Legal practitioners must navigate criticisms and potential inequitable outcomes, particularly in cases involving unlicensed use. The interplay of national laws and EU directives creates a rich tapestry of legal challenges for claimants and defendants alike, often resulting in irreconcilable disputes.",
