  "summary": "Mechanical vibration refers to oscillations of mechanical systems that can lead to the deterioration of the environment, particularly in the context of EU regulatory frameworks. Such vibrations may adversely affect both human health and ecological systems, prompting the need for stringent regulations under EU directives aimed at minimizing environmental impacts. The European Union has established guidelines to monitor and mitigate mechanical vibrations, particularly in industrial settings, to ensure compliance with environmental protection standards. These regulations are essential for safeguarding public health and promoting sustainable practices within member states, thereby addressing the broader implications of environmental deterioration.",
