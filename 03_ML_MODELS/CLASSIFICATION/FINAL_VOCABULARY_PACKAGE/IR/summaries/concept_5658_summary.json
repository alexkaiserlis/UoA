  "summary": "The European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG) is a legal form of organization established under EU law, specifically designed to facilitate cross-border cooperation among businesses and professionals. It allows members from different EU member states to collaborate without the need for full integration into a single entity. The EEIG aims to enhance economic activities, promote joint ventures, and share resources while maintaining the distinct legal identities of its members. This regulatory framework supports innovation and competitiveness within the internal market, fostering synergies that can lead to increased efficiency and economic growth across the European Union.",
