  "summary": "The \"law of banking\" encompasses a framework of regulations governing financial institutions within the EU, focusing on accountability and the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. Supervisors and regulators, including the European Central Bank (ECB) and national authorities, scrutinise banks' adherence to statutory requirements, ensuring the adequacy of their operations. This legal context advocates for enhanced awareness and procedural transparency, particularly regarding the transposed directives that address issues like duplication in regulatory practices. The law also covers the roles of branches and conglomerates, ensuring that institutional frameworks serve the broader objectives of financial stability and consumer protection, particularly in pensions and deposit insurance.",
