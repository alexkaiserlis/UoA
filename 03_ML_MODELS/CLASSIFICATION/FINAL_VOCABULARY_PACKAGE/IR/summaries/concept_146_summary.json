  "summary": "\"Domestic consumption\" within the EU regulatory framework refers to the utilization of agricultural products, such as cereals, maize, and sorghum, primarily within member states. This concept is crucial for understanding the mechanisms that govern market interventions and the accumulation of crops. The Common Market Organization (CMO) aims to reinforce the stability of domestic markets, countervailing disturbances that threaten food security. Legal instruments may include compensatory measures and preferential trade agreements, particularly with African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries. By simplifying regulations and addressing difficulties, the EU seeks to ensure that domestic consumption aligns with predetermined agricultural policies, ultimately supporting sustainable development and food sovereignty.",
