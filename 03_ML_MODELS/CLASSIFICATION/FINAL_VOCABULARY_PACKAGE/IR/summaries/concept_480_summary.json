  "summary": "The concept of \"diversification of exports\" within the EU trade policy framework refers to the strategic approach aimed at expanding the range of goods and services exported by EU member states. This regulatory initiative seeks to mitigate economic risks associated with over-reliance on specific markets or products, thereby enhancing trade resilience. By promoting a varied export portfolio, the EU aims to foster sustainable economic growth and strengthen its global trade position. This concept is integral to the EU's broader objectives of ensuring competitive trade practices and supporting member states in navigating the complexities of international markets.",
