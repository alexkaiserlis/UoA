  "summary": "The \"film industry\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework encompasses various aspects of film production, distribution, and exhibition. It involves the liberalisation of markets, allowing for the seamless exploitation of films across member states. Key regulations aim to safeguard the rights of creditors and ensure that distributors and cinemas can operate without undue restrictions. The industry is characterised by the dubbing and subtitling of films to cater to diverse nationalities, thus promoting cultural exchange. Challenges such as the distortion of competition and the need for self-regulation are addressed through progressive legislation, which aims to consolidate the sector while abolishing barriers to entry and ensuring satisfactory attainment of objectives.",
