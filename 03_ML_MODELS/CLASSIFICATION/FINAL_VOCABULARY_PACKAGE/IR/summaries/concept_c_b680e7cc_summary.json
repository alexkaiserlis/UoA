  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"tactical intelligence\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"strategic intelligence.\" This concept encompasses the systematic collection and analysis of information to inform decision-making processes at various governance levels. Tactical intelligence focuses on immediate operational needs, while strategic intelligence provides a broader perspective, aiding in long-term policy formulation and risk assessment. Within EU institutions, the effective processing of strategic intelligence is crucial for enhancing security, fostering cooperation among member states, and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. Thus, understanding the nuances between these terms is essential for accurate application in legal contexts.",
