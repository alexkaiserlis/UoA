  "summary": "The concept of \"visible trade balance,\" categorized under monetary relations, pertains to the difference between a country's exports and imports of tangible goods. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this term is often redirected to the preferred term \"trade balance,\" which encompasses both visible and invisible trade components, including services. The visible trade balance is crucial for assessing economic health and formulating monetary policies within the EU. It provides insights into trade dynamics, influencing decisions on tariffs and trade agreements. Understanding this balance is essential for maintaining economic stability and fostering competitive markets across member states.",
