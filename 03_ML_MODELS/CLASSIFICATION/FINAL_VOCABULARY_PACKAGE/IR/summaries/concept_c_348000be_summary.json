  "summary": "The concept of \"underweight\" is redirected to the preferred term \"body mass index\" (BMI) within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. BMI serves as a critical metric for assessing individual health status, particularly in the context of nutritional guidelines and public health policies. Regulatory documents often utilize BMI to define thresholds for underweight classifications, which can influence health interventions and social welfare programs. Understanding BMI is essential for compliance with EU health regulations, as it informs strategies aimed at combating malnutrition and promoting overall well-being among populations. Thus, \"underweight\" is intrinsically linked to the broader discourse on health metrics and regulatory compliance.",
