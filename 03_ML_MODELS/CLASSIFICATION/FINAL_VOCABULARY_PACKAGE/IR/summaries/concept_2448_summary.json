  "summary": "The \"yearly nature of the budget\" concept, redirecting to \"budget policy,\" underscores the cyclical and dynamic aspects of public finance within the EU framework. This policy outlines how budgets are crafted annually, allowing for projections that can modulate economic outlooks and respond to recessionary pressures. By frontloading expenditures, the EU aims to seize opportunities for expansionary fiscal measures, thereby boosting recoveries. However, imprecision in forecasts can lead to shortfalls or slippage, dampening the intended impact. The interconnectedness of economic factors necessitates a reorientation of budgetary strategies, ensuring that stabilisers are effectively underpinned to manage unexpected declines and support growth amidst a slowing backdrop.",
