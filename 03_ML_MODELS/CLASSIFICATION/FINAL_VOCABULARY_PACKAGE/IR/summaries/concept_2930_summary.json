  "summary": "The \"ECSC recommendation\" refers to guidelines issued under the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which was established to regulate the coal and steel industries in Europe. These recommendations serve as a regulatory framework aimed at fostering cooperation among member states, ensuring fair competition, and promoting sustainable practices within the construction sector. Although the ECSC has ceased to exist, its legacy influences contemporary EU legal instruments and regulatory policies. The recommendations provided a foundational approach to addressing market imbalances and enhancing industrial efficiency, thereby contributing to the broader objectives of European integration and economic stability.",
