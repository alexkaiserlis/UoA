  "summary": "The concept of \"digital economy taxation\" addresses the legal and regulatory challenges posed by the rapid evolution of digital business models within the EU. As traditional taxation frameworks struggle to capture the value generated by digital services, the EU has initiated discussions to establish a coherent approach to taxation that ensures fairness and efficiency. This includes proposals for a digital services tax and measures to prevent tax avoidance by multinational corporations. The term \"taxation of the digital economy\" serves as a redirect to \"digital economy taxation,\" highlighting the EU's focus on adapting its regulatory landscape to the unique characteristics of the digital marketplace.",
