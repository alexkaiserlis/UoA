  "summary": "The term \"subsidiary budget\" refers to a financial framework utilized by subordinate entities within the broader context of public finance and budget policy in the European Union. This concept is integral to ensuring that regional or local authorities can effectively manage allocated resources while adhering to overarching EU fiscal regulations. Subsidiary budgets facilitate the decentralization of financial responsibilities, allowing for tailored budgetary allocations that reflect specific local needs. In the EU legal context, these budgets must align with the principles of sound financial management and transparency, ensuring accountability and compliance with EU directives and regulations governing public expenditure.",
