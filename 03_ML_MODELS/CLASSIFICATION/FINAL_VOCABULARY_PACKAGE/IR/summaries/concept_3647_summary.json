  "summary": "The concept of \"international standard\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to established norms that facilitate interoperability and compliance across various sectors, including technology and technical regulations. These standards are crucial for adopters in the marketplace, ensuring that products and services are certificated and meet specific quality benchmarks. Institutions liaise with international bodies to implement these standards, which can involve complex processes such as recertificated assessments and restatements of compliance. In hyperinflationary contexts, the need for robust standards becomes even more critical, as they help mitigate risks associated with distressed assets and misprints in documentation. The establishment of these standards often requires detailed verification and may involve the reclassification of existing norms to accommodate evolving technologies, such as transponders and aeronautical systems. Ultimately, international standards serve as a foundational framework for ensuring that all stakeholders, including preparers and readers of regulatory documents, can navigate the intricacies of compliance effectively.",
