  "summary": "Zambia, located in Southern Africa, plays a significant role in the economic geography of the region, particularly in relation to the EU's external action and trade policies. The Zambian government has engaged in cooperative agreements, such as the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), to facilitate trade with EU member states. Lusaka, the capital, is pivotal in mobilization efforts for regional peace initiatives, signified by ceasefire agreements involving neighboring countries like Malawi and Zimbabwe. Furthermore, Zambia's strategic partnerships with nations like Ethiopia and Djibouti enhance its diplomatic outreach. The EU's regulatory frameworks accommodate Zambian interests, fostering economic development and stability in the region.",
