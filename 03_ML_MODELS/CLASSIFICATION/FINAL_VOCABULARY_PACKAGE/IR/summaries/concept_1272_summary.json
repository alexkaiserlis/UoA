  "summary": "In the context of the EU legal system, a \"bailiff\" is a judicial officer responsible for executing court orders and ensuring compliance with legal decisions. Operating within the framework of national legal systems, bailiffs play a crucial role in the enforcement of judgments, including the collection of debts and the eviction of tenants. Their functions may vary across member states, reflecting diverse legal traditions and regulatory environments. Bailiffs are often involved in facilitating access to justice by ensuring that court rulings are effectively implemented, thereby upholding the rule of law within the EU's legal architecture.",
