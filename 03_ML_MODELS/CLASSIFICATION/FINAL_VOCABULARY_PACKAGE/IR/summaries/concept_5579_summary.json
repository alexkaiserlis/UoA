  "summary": "Operational expenditure (EU) refers to the chargeable expenditures incurred by EU institutions in the course of their regular functions. These expenditures are crucial for the efficient utilization of resources and are subject to strict legality and regularity examinations. The EU stipulates that operational expenditures must be accounted for transparently, ensuring that refunds and financial interventions are appropriately managed. In discussions regarding budgetary programming, operational expenditure plays a vital role in stabilising rural development and addressing outbreaks of danger, such as animal diseases. The underlying framework for these expenditures is designed to facilitate the closure of financial gaps and to declare compliance with EU regulations, mutatis mutandis.",
