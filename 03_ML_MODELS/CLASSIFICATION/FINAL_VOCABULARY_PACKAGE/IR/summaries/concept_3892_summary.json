  "summary": "The concept of \"synthetic fibre,\" redirected to the preferred term \"man-made fibre,\" encompasses a range of materials produced through chemical processes, including phenyleneterephthalamide and modacrylic. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these fibres are crucial in the leather and textile industries, influencing legislation that governs their production and marketing. Companies like Courtaulds and Snia are key players in this sector, with manufacturing facilities in regions such as Kingsport, Tennessee, and Montemurlo. The regulation of these fibres involves standards for warp and dress applications, ensuring quality and safety in textiles. The industry also addresses issues related to discontinuous fibres and their environmental impact, promoting sustainable practices among imalciligi and fabrikalari across Europe.",
