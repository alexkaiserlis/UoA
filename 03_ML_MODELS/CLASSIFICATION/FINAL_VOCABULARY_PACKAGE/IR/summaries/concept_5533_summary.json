  "summary": "The concept of \"deposit on a polluting product\" pertains to an environmental policy mechanism within the European Union aimed at mitigating the ecological impact of hazardous goods. This regulatory instrument requires manufacturers or importers to pay a deposit on products deemed polluting, which incentivizes the reduction of environmental harm. The deposit system encourages sustainable practices by promoting the recycling and proper disposal of such products. In the EU legal framework, this concept aligns with broader environmental protection goals, ensuring that the costs associated with pollution are internalized by producers, thereby fostering accountability and responsibility in product lifecycle management.",
