  "summary": "Mitigating circumstances refer to factors that may reduce the culpability of an individual in criminal law within the EU legal framework. These circumstances can influence the severity of penalties imposed by judicial authorities. In assessing mitigating circumstances, courts consider aspects such as the defendant's mental state, the context of the offense, and any external pressures that may have contributed to the criminal behavior. The recognition of mitigating circumstances is crucial for ensuring proportionality in sentencing, aligning with the principles of justice and fairness enshrined in EU regulations. This concept underscores the importance of individualized justice in the criminal law system.",
