  "summary": "The \"liability of the State\" in EU law refers to the legal responsibility of a Member State for damages caused to individuals due to breaches of EU law. This concept is pivotal in ensuring accountability and upholding the rule of law within the Union. It encompasses scenarios where a State's actions or omissions lead to violations of EU regulations or directives, resulting in harm to citizens or entities. The principle of State liability is grounded in the need for effective judicial protection, as established by the Court of Justice of the European Union, which mandates that individuals can seek redress for such infringements.",
