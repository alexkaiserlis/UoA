  "summary": "The \"temperate zone\" refers to a biogeographical region characterized by moderate climatic conditions, which significantly influences biodiversity and ecosystems within the European Union. In EU legal and regulatory contexts, understanding the temperate zone is crucial for environmental protection directives, such as the Habitats Directive, which aims to preserve natural habitats and species. The temperate zone's unique flora and fauna necessitate specific conservation measures to mitigate the impacts of climate change and human activities. Thus, the concept is integral to EU policies aimed at sustainable development and ecological balance, ensuring compliance with environmental standards and promoting biodiversity conservation.",
