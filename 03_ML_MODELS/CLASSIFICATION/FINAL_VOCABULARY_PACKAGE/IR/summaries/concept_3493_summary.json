  "summary": "The concept of \"territorial occupation,\" redirected to the preferred term \"military occupation,\" pertains to the legal framework governing the control of territory by foreign armed forces. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, military occupation is addressed under international humanitarian law, particularly the Geneva Conventions. This legal construct establishes the rights and responsibilities of occupying powers and the protections afforded to civilian populations. The EU actively engages in monitoring and responding to situations of military occupation to uphold international security and promote compliance with human rights standards. Thus, understanding military occupation is crucial for EU policies on conflict resolution and humanitarian assistance.",
