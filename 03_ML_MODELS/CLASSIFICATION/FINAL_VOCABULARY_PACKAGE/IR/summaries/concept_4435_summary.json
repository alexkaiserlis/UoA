  "summary": "The \"rest period\" concept is crucial in the organization of work and working conditions, particularly for seafarers in the EU maritime sector. It mandates that crew members on merchant ships are afforded adequate time to rest, thereby preventing fatigue and ensuring safety at sea. The International Labour Organization (ILO) emphasizes the importance of these periods to rectify deficiencies in working hours, which can manifestly lead to hazardous conditions. Shipowners, unions, and inspectors must enforce regulations that designate legitimate rest periods, reflecting a commitment to the welfare of seafarers. Compliance records are essential for addressing complaints and ensuring that excessively long working hours do not occur, especially in busy ports.",
