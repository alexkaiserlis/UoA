  "summary": "\"Residential mobility\" refers to the ability of individuals, particularly workers, to change their place of residence within the EU, which is crucial for ensuring equality in access to employment opportunities. This concept entails the freedom to reside successively in different member states, thereby enhancing occupational mobility. It addresses issues such as the maintenance of rights upon retirement or in the event of unforeseen circumstances like death or disease. The legal framework secures workers' rights, enabling them to enjoy the benefits of their residence without disadvantage. This mobility is interpreted as a corollary of the EU's commitment to active labor market policies, which progressively lead to a more integrated and dynamic workforce.",
