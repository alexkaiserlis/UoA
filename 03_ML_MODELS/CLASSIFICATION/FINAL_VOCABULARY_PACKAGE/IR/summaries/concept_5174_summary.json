This model promotes lifelong learning and inclusivity, aligning with EU objectives to enhance educational standards and mobility. By facilitating flexible learning environments, open universities contribute to the EU's commitment to fostering knowledge-based economies and social cohesion. The summer university format typically offers intensive courses, enriching the open university's offerings during the academic break.",
