  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"financial account\" is often redirected to the preferred term \"account,\" which encompasses various financial instruments and reporting standards. Financial accounts, including those governed by IFRS and GAAP, are crucial for ensuring transparency among counterparties, such as issuers and borrowers. They facilitate the capitalisation of intangible assets and the booking of disbursements, while also alleviating concerns regarding defaults. Regulatory frameworks, like those outlined in prospectuses and advertisements, require accountants to reconcile accounts and report on portfolios. The convergence of standards, as seen in the CMFB and ESMA guidelines, ensures that financial accounts fit within a coherent regulatory landscape, addressing conditionality and retroactivity in financial reporting.",
