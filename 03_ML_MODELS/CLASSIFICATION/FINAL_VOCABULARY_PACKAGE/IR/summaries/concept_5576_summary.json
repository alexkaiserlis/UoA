  "summary": "The concept of \"EU expenditure,\" a redirect to \"European Union expenditure,\" encompasses the financial outlays made by the EU in various sectors, including health, defence, and development. This includes the procurement of vaccines, where the EU administers doses to member states, ensuring the availability of inactivated strains for public health. The EU's financial framework details instalments for projects in regions like Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iraq, while also forecasting revenue from tenders and collecting data on expenditures. The EU decides on funding allocations based on nominated projects, ensuring assurance of resources for forthcoming initiatives, such as pilot programs in Asia and concentrated efforts in military and police support.",
