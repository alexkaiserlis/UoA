  "summary": "The \"capacity to contract\" is a fundamental concept in EU civil law, empowering individuals and entities to engage in legal agreements. This capacity is crucial for promoting economic activity and facilitating investments, as it enables parties to realize their desired projects and policies. The integration of this concept within EU regulations helps reinforce creditworthiness and stimulates greater financial mechanisms. By ensuring that all parties are willing and able to enter contracts, the EU aims to create a more even distribution of opportunities, enhancing the size and scope of borrowings and loans. This legal framework supports the convergence of diverse economic bodies, ultimately contributing to a robust market environment.",
