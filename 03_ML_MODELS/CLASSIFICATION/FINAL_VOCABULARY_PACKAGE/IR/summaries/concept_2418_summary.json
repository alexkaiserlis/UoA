  "summary": "The term \"tropical plant\" refers to a category of plant products within EU regulations, encompassing various species such as Salvia hispanica, commonly known as chia. These plants are often packed as ingredients in foods, necessitating compliance with specific legal frameworks. The regularity of their transit across EU frontiers is subject to scrutiny, where companies must provide proof of compliance to avoid charges of irregularity. Waivers may be granted under certain conditions, but applicants must present reasoned explanations for any deviations. The intake of these novel ingredients must meet safety standards, alleviating potential toxicological concerns and ensuring consumer satisfaction.",
