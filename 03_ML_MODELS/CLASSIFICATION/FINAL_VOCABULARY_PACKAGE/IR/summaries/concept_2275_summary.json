  "summary": "A \"free-trade agreement\" (FTA) is a pivotal instrument in international trade, aimed at liberalising trade between parties by reducing or eliminating tariffs and other trade barriers. Within the EU context, FTAs are established to oversee trade relations with various countries, such as the DCFTA with Eastern Partnership nations. These agreements often include provisions on the application of standards, ensuring that products like automobile gearboxes and camshafts meet regulatory requirements. The negotiations involve subcommittees and arbitrators to resolve disputes, with talks often requiring unanimity among member states. As the EU consolidates its trade strategy, FTAs are crucial for accruing economic benefits and fostering ambitious partnerships, such as with Panama.",
