  "summary": "A \"motion of censure\" is a formal procedure within the European Parliament that allows Members of Parliament (MEPs) to express disapproval of the actions or policies of the European Commission or its members. This mechanism serves as a critical tool for parliamentary oversight, enabling MEPs to hold the executive accountable. If a motion of censure is adopted by a two-thirds majority, it can lead to the resignation of the Commission. This process underscores the principles of democratic accountability and transparency within the EU's institutional framework, ensuring that the executive remains responsive to the legislative body.",
