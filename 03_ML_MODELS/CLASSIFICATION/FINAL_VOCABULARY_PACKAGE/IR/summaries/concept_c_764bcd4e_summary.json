  "summary": "The Arctic Council is a prominent intergovernmental forum that facilitates cooperation among Arctic states, indigenous communities, and other stakeholders on issues related to sustainable development and environmental protection in the Arctic region. Established in 1996, it plays a crucial role in addressing challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and maritime safety. The European Union, as an observer, engages with the Council to influence regulatory frameworks and promote collaborative efforts in Arctic governance. The Council's initiatives align with EU policies aimed at fostering international cooperation and ensuring the sustainable use of Arctic resources, thereby reinforcing the EU's commitment to global environmental stewardship.",
