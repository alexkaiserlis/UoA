  "summary": "The concept of \"publishing of prices\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the obligation of sellers to provide unambiguous and standardized pricing information. This practice is crucial for fostering healthy competition among retailers and ensuring that buyers can make meaningful comparisons. Prices must be arranged in catalogues or invoices, typically expressed in common units such as kilogramme or litre, to facilitate easy understanding. By triggering transparency, this regulation invites consumers to anticipate their choices without being overly burdened by complex pricing structures. The fixation of prices must be clear and printed, allowing for straightforward comparisons across various branches of commerce, thereby waiving any ambiguity that could arise in the marketplace.",
