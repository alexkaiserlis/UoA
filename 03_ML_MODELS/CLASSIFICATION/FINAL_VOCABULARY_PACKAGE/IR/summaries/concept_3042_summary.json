  "summary": "The concept of \"federation of States,\" redirected to \"federalism,\" pertains to a political framework where multiple sovereign entities unite under a central authority while retaining distinct legal identities. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, federalism is crucial for understanding the distribution of powers between the EU and its Member States. This paradigm facilitates cooperation and governance across diverse jurisdictions, enabling the EU to enact regulations that harmonize laws while respecting national sovereignty. The principles of federalism underpin the EU's legal structure, influencing legislative processes and the balance of authority, thereby shaping the Union's political landscape.",
