  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"dissident\" is often redirected to the preferred term \"dissidence,\" which encompasses the expression of opposition to established political authority or prevailing ideologies. Dissidence can manifest in various forms, including political activism, protests, or critiques of government policies. The European Union recognizes the importance of safeguarding fundamental rights, including freedom of expression and assembly, which are essential for fostering a democratic society. Legal frameworks within the EU aim to protect dissidents from persecution, ensuring that diverse political opinions can coexist without infringing on public safety or order.",
