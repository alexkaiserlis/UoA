  "summary": "The \"right to property\" is a fundamental principle enshrined in EU law, specifically articulated in Article 17 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This right safeguards individuals' ownership and use of property, ensuring protection against arbitrary deprivation. In the regulatory context, it serves as a critical framework for balancing public interests, such as urban development and environmental protection, with private ownership rights. The right to property is also subject to limitations, provided they are lawful, necessary, and proportional. This concept is essential in upholding legal certainty and fostering economic stability within the EU's internal market.",
