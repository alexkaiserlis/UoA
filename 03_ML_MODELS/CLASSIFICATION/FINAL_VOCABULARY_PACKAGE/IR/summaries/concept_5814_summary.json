  "summary": "The infringement procedure (EU) is an arduous legal mechanism employed by the European Commission to contest violations of EU law by member states. When a state is unnotified of its obligations, the Commission may initiate proceedings, often resulting in injunctions to enjoin compliance. This procedure involves statistical analyses, such as economiques and statistique data, to substantiate claims. Member states may repetitively deny allegations, leading to further legal complexities. The process aims to smooth relations and ensure adherence to EU regulations, addressing issues ranging from environmental standards to market competition, thereby reinforcing the integrity of the EU legal framework.",
