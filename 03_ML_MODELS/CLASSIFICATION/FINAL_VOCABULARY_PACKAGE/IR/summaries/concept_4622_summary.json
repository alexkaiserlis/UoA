  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"transport user\" refers to individuals or organizations that utilize various transport services, including travellers and shipping entities. This concept encompasses those who cross frontiers, such as those entering Ceuta and Melilla, and highlights the importance of maintaining efficient routes and navigation links. The harmonization of transport regulations aims to simplify the experiences of transport users, addressing distortions and raising allowances for personal luggage. By jointly promoting specialized organizations, the EU seeks to provide reliefs for transport users, ensuring that their needs are met while gradually improving the overall transport system across continental and coastal routes.",
