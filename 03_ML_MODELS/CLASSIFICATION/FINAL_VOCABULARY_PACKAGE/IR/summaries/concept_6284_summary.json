  "summary": "In the context of EU law, an \"opinion\" refers to a formal expression of views or recommendations issued by various EU institutions, particularly the European Commission, the European Parliament, or the European Court of Justice. These opinions serve as advisory instruments, guiding legislative processes or judicial interpretations without possessing binding legal force. They can address a wide range of issues, from regulatory compliance to policy development, and are crucial for ensuring coherence within the EU legal framework. While opinions are not legally enforceable, they significantly influence the formulation of EU legislation and the interpretation of existing laws, thereby shaping the regulatory landscape.",
