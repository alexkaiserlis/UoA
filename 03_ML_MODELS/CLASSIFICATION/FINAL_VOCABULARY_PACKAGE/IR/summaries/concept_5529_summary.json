  "summary": "The concept of \"leave for political activities\" pertains to the provisions within EU electoral procedures and voting regulations that allow individuals, particularly public servants or employees, to take time off from their professional duties to engage in political activities. This leave is essential for ensuring democratic participation and facilitating the exercise of electoral rights. It underscores the EU's commitment to fostering active citizenship and political engagement among its populace. By legislating such leave, the EU aims to balance professional obligations with the fundamental right to participate in the democratic process, thereby enhancing the integrity and inclusiveness of electoral systems across member states.",
