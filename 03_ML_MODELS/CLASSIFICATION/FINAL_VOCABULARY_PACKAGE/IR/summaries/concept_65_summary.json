Counties serve as essential units for local governance, facilitating the implementation of EU regulations and directives at a regional level. They are responsible for various public services, including education, transportation, and social welfare, thereby ensuring compliance with both national and EU standards. The delineation of counties enhances the efficiency of public administration, allowing for tailored governance that meets the specific needs of local populations while adhering to overarching EU legal principles.",
