  "summary": "Censorship, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the suppression or control of information dissemination, particularly in communications. It encompasses various forms of restrictions imposed by authorities on content deemed inappropriate, harmful, or contrary to public interest. The EU emphasizes the balance between freedom of expression and the need to protect societal values, often addressing censorship in directives and regulations concerning digital media, broadcasting, and online platforms. Legal instruments aim to safeguard fundamental rights while ensuring that censorship does not infringe upon democratic principles. The ongoing discourse around censorship remains pivotal in shaping EU policies on communication and information access.",
