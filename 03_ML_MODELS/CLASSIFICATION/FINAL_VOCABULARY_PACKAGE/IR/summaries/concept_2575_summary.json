  "summary": "The concept of \"purchasing power\" is pivotal in the context of national accounts within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. It refers to the capacity of individuals or households to acquire goods and services, reflecting the economic well-being of a population. In EU regulations, purchasing power is often analyzed to assess economic disparities among member states, influencing policy decisions and funding allocations. Accurate measurement of purchasing power is essential for formulating effective economic policies, ensuring equitable resource distribution, and enhancing overall economic stability within the Union. Thus, it serves as a critical indicator for evaluating the socio-economic landscape across the EU.",
