  "summary": "The concept of \"activating price\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to a mechanism that triggers specific pricing structures for perishable goods, such as fruits, vegetables, and poultrymeat. This price is calculated by combining various factors, including seasonal availability and market demand. For instance, the activating price may be fixed for fresh produce like cherries and peas, ensuring that farmers receive fair compensation for their unprocessed products. Additionally, it pertains to the grading of goods, where the chairman of relevant committees may issue permits that guide market quotations. Henceforth, this concept is crucial for maintaining stability in the agricultural sector, particularly for products like eggs, pigmeat, and lactalbumin.",
