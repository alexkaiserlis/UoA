  "summary": "A \"securities settlement system\" refers to a framework that facilitates the transfer of securities and the corresponding payments between parties, ensuring the finality of transactions. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, it is crucial for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of financial markets, thereby supporting the free movement of capital. This concept is often redirected to the preferred term \"payment system,\" which encompasses broader mechanisms for processing payments. The regulatory oversight of securities settlement systems is essential for mitigating risks and enhancing transparency in financial transactions, aligning with EU objectives for a unified financial market.",
