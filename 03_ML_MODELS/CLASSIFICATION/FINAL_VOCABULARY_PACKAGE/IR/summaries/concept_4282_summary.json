  "summary": "\"Financial autonomy\" refers to the capacity of public authorities within the European Union to independently manage their financial resources, ensuring sustainable budgetary practices. This concept is pivotal in the context of public finance and budget policy, as it underpins the ability of local and regional governments to generate revenue, allocate funds, and implement fiscal policies without excessive reliance on external sources. Financial autonomy promotes accountability and efficiency in public spending, aligning with the EU's objectives of enhancing governance and economic stability. It is essential for fostering local development and ensuring that public services meet the needs of citizens effectively.",
