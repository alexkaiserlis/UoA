  "summary": "Isolationism, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to a foreign policy approach characterized by a deliberate withdrawal from international engagement and cooperation. This concept can impact international security, as it may lead to reduced participation in collective security arrangements and multilateral treaties. The EU, as a prominent actor in global governance, often advocates for collaborative strategies to address security threats. Isolationism could undermine the EU's ability to promote stability and peace, necessitating a careful balance between national interests and the collective security obligations of member states. Thus, understanding isolationism is critical for evaluating EU foreign policy dynamics.",
