  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"veto\" refers to the power of a member state or institution to reject a proposed decision or legislation, thereby preventing its adoption. This mechanism is crucial in maintaining the balance of power within the EU, particularly in areas requiring unanimous consent, such as foreign policy and certain budgetary matters. The veto serves as a safeguard for national interests, allowing states to block measures perceived as detrimental. Its application underscores the complexities of decision-making processes in the EU, highlighting the interplay between collective governance and individual state sovereignty.",
