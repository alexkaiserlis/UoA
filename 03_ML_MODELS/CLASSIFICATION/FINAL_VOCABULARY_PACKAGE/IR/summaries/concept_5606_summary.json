  "summary": "The \"drafting of EU law\" involves a meticulous process that requires interpreters and translators to ensure precise communication across linguistic boundaries. This lawmaking process is overseen by supervisors who advocate for clarity and coherence in legal texts. The drafting phase includes the recruitment of assistants who help lengthen and refine documents, ensuring that all signatures are duly obtained. It is essential for the legal framework to govern various sectors, including environmental protections for migratory species like sardines and shellfish. Extensions and indemnities may be discussed, while the prestige of the EU is upheld through accomplished and smart drafting practices that avoid incidents of ambiguity. The relationship between this concept and the preferred term highlights the importance of precise legal language in creating effective and enforceable regulations.",
