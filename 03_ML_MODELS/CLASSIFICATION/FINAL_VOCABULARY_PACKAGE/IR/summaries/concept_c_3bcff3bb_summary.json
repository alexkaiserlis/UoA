  "summary": "The concept of \"urban waste,\" which is redirected to the preferred term \"municipal waste,\" pertains to the broader category of environmental deterioration within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Municipal waste encompasses the waste generated by households and similar sources, significantly impacting urban environments. The EU has established directives aimed at minimizing the generation of municipal waste, promoting recycling, and ensuring proper waste management practices to mitigate environmental degradation. Effective regulation of municipal waste is crucial for achieving sustainability goals and protecting public health, thereby addressing the challenges posed by urbanization and population growth in EU member states.",
