  "summary": "\"Hidden unemployment\" refers to individuals who are not actively seeking employment but are nonetheless available for work, thus remaining unaccounted for in official unemployment statistics. This phenomenon poses challenges for EU labor market assessments and policy formulation, as it obscures the true state of employment and economic health. Legal and regulatory frameworks within the EU aim to address hidden unemployment by promoting active labor market policies and enhancing data collection methods. By recognizing and addressing this issue, the EU seeks to ensure comprehensive employment strategies that reflect the realities of the labor market, ultimately fostering economic stability and growth.",
