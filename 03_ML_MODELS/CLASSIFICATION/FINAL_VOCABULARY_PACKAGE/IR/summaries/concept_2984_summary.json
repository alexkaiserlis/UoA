  "summary": "The concept of \"farm return\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the systematic reporting and analysis of agricultural outputs and incomes. It is a methodological approach that ensures farmers, particularly in Portugal and other regions, undertake rationally planned activities, such as the cultivation of citrus and mushrooms. This process involves the completion of chargeable returns, which are essential for determining gainful agricultural practices. The typology of farm returns varies, reflecting diverse farming systems, including nurseries and distant hill farms. By delivering accurate data, farmers can overcome uncontrollable variables and enhance their accountancy practices, thereby facilitating the codification of agricultural regulations and instructions.",
