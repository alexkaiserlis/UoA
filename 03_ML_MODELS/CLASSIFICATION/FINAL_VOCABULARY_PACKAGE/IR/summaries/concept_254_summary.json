  "summary": "Chartering, within the EU regulatory framework, refers to the practice of hiring vessels for the transportation of goods, which can include tramp and liner shipping. This concept is enshrined in various jurisdictions, facilitating the efficient movement of shippers' cargo across waterways. The liberalization of chartering has led to alliances and consortia that enhance logistical efficiencies but also raise concerns about overcapacity and saturation in certain lanes. The weakening of traditional cabotage laws has resulted in a more competitive environment, where carriers must tailor their services to fluctuating market demands. This dynamic landscape presents both achievements and anomalies, as stakeholders navigate the causal relationships between surcharges, groupings, and the undoing of previous regulations. Ultimately, chartering embodies a complex interplay of commercial interests, citizen rights, and regulatory challenges that continue to evolve in the EU context.",
