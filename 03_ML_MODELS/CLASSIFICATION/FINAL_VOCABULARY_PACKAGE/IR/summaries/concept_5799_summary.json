  "summary": "The concept of \"native,\" as categorized under demography and population, redirects to the preferred term \"indigenous population.\" In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"indigenous population\" refers to groups that have historical ties to a specific territory and maintain distinct cultural identities. This concept is crucial in discussions surrounding minority rights, social inclusion, and cultural heritage protection within EU legislation. The recognition of indigenous populations is essential for ensuring their participation in decision-making processes and safeguarding their rights under various EU frameworks, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.",
