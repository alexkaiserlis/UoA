  "summary": "Beryllium, categorized under the iron, steel, and other metal industries, is a lightweight metal with significant applications in aerospace, electronics, and nuclear sectors. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, beryllium is subject to stringent regulations due to its toxicological properties and potential health risks, including chronic beryllium disease. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) oversees the registration, evaluation, and authorization of beryllium under the REACH Regulation, ensuring that its usage complies with safety standards to protect human health and the environment. Regulatory measures also aim to mitigate exposure risks in industrial processes involving beryllium.",
