  "summary": "Intra-EU trade refers to the exchange of goods and services between member states of the European Union, governed by comprehensive legal frameworks and trade policies established since 2006. This concept is crucial for ensuring that incoterms are uniformly applied, facilitating smooth transactions. Documentation requirements, such as EMCS and NCTS, are vital for compliance, particularly in sectors like agricultur and zootechnic. The regulatory environment addresses issues like retrograde infections and serovars, ensuring that products, including chorizo and ham, meet health standards. Additionally, intra-EU trade supports economic stability, allowing for the identification and eradication of serious threats to public health, such as tuberculins and Aujeszky's disease.",
