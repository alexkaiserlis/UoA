  "summary": "The \"producer responsibility scheme,\" commonly referred to as \"extended producer responsibility\" (EPR), is a pivotal concept in EU environmental policy aimed at enhancing sustainability. EPR mandates that producers bear the financial and operational responsibility for the lifecycle of their products, particularly concerning waste management and recycling. This regulatory framework incentivizes manufacturers to design eco-friendly products and reduces environmental impact by promoting resource efficiency. Under EU directives, such as the Waste Framework Directive, EPR schemes are integral to achieving circular economy goals, ensuring that producers contribute to waste reduction and recovery efforts, thereby fostering accountability and environmental stewardship.",
