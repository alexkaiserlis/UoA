  "summary": "Unfair dismissal refers to the termination of an employee's contract without just cause or proper procedure, contravening established legal protections under EU employment law. The concept is pivotal in ensuring that workers are safeguarded against arbitrary or discriminatory practices in the workplace. EU directives, such as the Directive 2001/23/EC on the protection of employees in the event of transfers of undertakings, emphasize the necessity for fair treatment during dismissals. Member States are required to implement regulations that provide remedies for unfair dismissal, thereby promoting equitable labor relations and upholding fundamental rights within the employment sector.",
