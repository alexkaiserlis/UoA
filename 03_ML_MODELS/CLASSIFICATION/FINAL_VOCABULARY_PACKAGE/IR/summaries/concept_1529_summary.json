  "summary": "The concept of \"young worker\" within the EU legal framework predominantly refers to individuals engaged in employment who are typically in the early stages of their careers. This demographic is crucial for labour market reforms aimed at reducing unemployment and enhancing socioeconomic outcomes. The EU encourages member states to invest in vocational training modules that equip young workers with specialised skills, helping them to navigate job markets effectively. By promoting initiatives that broaden opportunities for youth, the EU aims to retain talent and support migrants seeking employment. Employers are urged to rethink recruitment strategies, ensuring that young workers are adequately supported and protected from workplace accidents.",
