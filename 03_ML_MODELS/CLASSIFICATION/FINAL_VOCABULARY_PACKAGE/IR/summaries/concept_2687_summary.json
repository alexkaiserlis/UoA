  "summary": "The concept of \"representative price\" in EU legal and regulatory contexts refers to a benchmark price used for the valuation of goods, particularly in sectors like landbouw and visserij. This price is crucial for ensuring marketable transactions and is often derived from quotations in major trading hubs, such as Rotterdam and Minneapolis. It aids in the assessment of overpayments and deductions, ensuring that deviations from standard pricing are addressed. For example, when evaluating the price of grains, such as rye and sorghum, authorities may disregard unreliable data or invalid quotations. The representative price emerges as a useful tool for maintaining fairness in trade, particularly when subjects like albumin and lactalbumin are involved in complex transactions. By opting for a representative price, regulators can effectively manage discounts and ensure that all parties are settled on a fair value, thus preventing abandoned claims and fostering transparency in the market.",
