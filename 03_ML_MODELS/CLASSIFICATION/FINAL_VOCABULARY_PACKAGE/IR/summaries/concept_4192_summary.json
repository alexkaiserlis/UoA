  "summary": "A \"professional partnership\" is a legal form of organisation prevalent within the European Union, primarily designed for individuals engaged in professions such as law, medicine, and accounting. This structure allows professionals to collaborate while maintaining individual liability for their actions. In EU regulatory frameworks, professional partnerships are subject to specific legal requirements that govern their formation, operation, and dissolution. These partnerships facilitate shared resources and expertise, promoting efficiency and innovation within professional services. Furthermore, they are often regulated by national laws, which may vary across member states, reflecting the diverse legal landscapes within the EU.",
