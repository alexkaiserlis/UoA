  "summary": "In the context of EU international trade, the term \"primary product\" refers to unprocessed goods that serve as the foundational inputs for further manufacturing or processing. These products, which include items like casein, inulin, and various syrups, are crucial for industries such as pastry and spirituous beverage production. Regulatory frameworks often involve arrangements for prefinancing and rectification of trade practices to prevent misinterpretation of product classifications. The cumulated earnings from primary products can be jeopardized by diverging interpretations of trade agreements, necessitating clear citation and documentation. Thus, the placement of primary products within trade regulations is vital for ensuring compliance and easing market access.",
