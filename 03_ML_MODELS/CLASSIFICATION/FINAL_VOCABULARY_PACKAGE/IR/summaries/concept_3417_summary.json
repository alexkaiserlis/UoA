  "summary": "The concept of \"requisitioning of workers\" pertains to the legal framework governing the temporary allocation of labor during emergencies or significant disruptions within the EU. This practice allows governments to mandate the employment of individuals in essential sectors, ensuring the continuity of critical services and economic stability. Under EU labour law, requisitioning must adhere to principles of proportionality and necessity, safeguarding workers' rights while addressing urgent societal needs. This regulatory mechanism is particularly relevant in contexts such as public health crises or national emergencies, where the swift mobilization of human resources is imperative for effective response and recovery efforts.",
