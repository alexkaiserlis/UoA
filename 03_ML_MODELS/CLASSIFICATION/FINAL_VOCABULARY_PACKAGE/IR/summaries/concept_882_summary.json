  "summary": "The term \"gold standard\" in the context of EU monetary relations refers to a benchmark for evaluating the stability and reliability of currencies. Historically, the gold standard involved pegging currency values to a specific quantity of gold, ensuring a fixed exchange rate and fostering trust in monetary systems. In contemporary EU regulatory frameworks, the concept underpins discussions on monetary policy, inflation control, and the credibility of the euro. While the EU operates under a fiat currency system, the gold standard serves as a historical reference point for assessing the robustness of financial instruments and the integrity of economic governance within member states.",
