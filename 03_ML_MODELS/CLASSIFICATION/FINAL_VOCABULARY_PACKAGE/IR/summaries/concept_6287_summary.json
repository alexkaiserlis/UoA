  "summary": "The term \"democratic deficit\" refers to a perceived shortfall in the democratic legitimacy of the European Union's institutions and decision-making processes. This concept highlights concerns regarding the distance between EU governance and the citizens it serves, often critiquing the limited direct electoral accountability of key bodies such as the European Commission and the European Council. Critics argue that this deficit undermines the EU's democratic foundations, as citizens may feel disenfranchised and disconnected from the regulatory frameworks that govern their lives. Addressing the democratic deficit is essential for enhancing transparency, participation, and trust in the EU's institutional architecture.",
