  "summary": "The concept of \"neutrality\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the stance of non-alignment in international security matters. It signifies a stateâ€™s commitment to abstain from participating in military alliances or conflicts, thereby fostering a climate of impartiality. In EU documents, neutrality is often discussed in relation to the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), where member states may adopt varying positions on military engagements. This principle is crucial for maintaining peace and stability, allowing for diplomatic resolutions without the influence of military obligations, thereby enhancing the EU's role as a mediator in international disputes.",
