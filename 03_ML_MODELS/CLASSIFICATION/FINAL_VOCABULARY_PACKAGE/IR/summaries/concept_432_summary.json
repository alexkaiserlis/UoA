  "summary": "The concept of \"social progress,\" redirected to \"social development,\" is pivotal in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, focusing on the alleviation of inequalities among marginalised minorities. It underpins the Union's commitment to fostering democratic values and peaceful reconciliation among peoples, particularly in fragile regions like Yemen and Gaza. The EU's initiatives aim to bridge gaps in social advancement, ensuring that all counties, including those lagging behind, can benefit from restored synergies and modernised policies. By affirming the need for credible contributions and backing from member states, the EU seeks to structure its foundations for a more equitable society, addressing recurrent challenges through a unified approach.",
