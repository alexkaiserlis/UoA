  "summary": "The concept of \"replacement of resources\" within the context of EU environmental policy pertains to the strategic substitution of depleted or harmful resources with sustainable alternatives. This regulatory framework aims to mitigate environmental degradation by promoting the efficient use of resources and encouraging the adoption of renewable materials. The EU's commitment to circular economy principles underscores the importance of resource replacement as a means to enhance ecological resilience and foster sustainable development. Legal instruments and directives, such as the Waste Framework Directive, support this initiative by establishing guidelines for resource management and encouraging innovation in resource recovery and recycling practices.",
