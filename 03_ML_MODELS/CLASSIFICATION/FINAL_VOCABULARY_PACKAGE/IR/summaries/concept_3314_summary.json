  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"natural descendant\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"descendant.\" This concept encompasses individuals who are direct offspring of a person, including children, grandchildren, and further generations. The classification of \"descendant\" is crucial in various legal frameworks, particularly in matters of inheritance, family law, and citizenship rights. Understanding the implications of being a \"descendant\" can influence legal entitlements and obligations within the EU, ensuring that rights are preserved across generations. This term is significant in establishing familial relationships in legal documents and regulatory compliance.",
