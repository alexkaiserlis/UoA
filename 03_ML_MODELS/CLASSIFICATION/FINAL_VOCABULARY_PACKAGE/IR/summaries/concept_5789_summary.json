  "summary": "The \"theory of law,\" a concept often redirected to the \"philosophy of law,\" encompasses the foundational principles that underpin legal systems, including those within the EU. This discipline examines the nature, purpose, and interpretation of law, influencing regulatory frameworks and judicial reasoning. In the context of EU legal documents, the philosophy of law informs the development of legislation, the application of treaties, and the adjudication of disputes by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Understanding this theory is essential for comprehending the complexities of EU law and its interaction with member states' legal traditions.",
