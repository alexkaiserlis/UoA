It involves the systematic integration of gender considerations into the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of policies and legislation. This approach seeks to identify and address gender disparities, ensuring that both women's and men's needs and experiences are taken into account. By embedding gender perspectives into decision-making processes, the EU aims to foster an inclusive environment that enhances rights and freedoms for all individuals, ultimately contributing to the achievement of substantive equality in society.",
