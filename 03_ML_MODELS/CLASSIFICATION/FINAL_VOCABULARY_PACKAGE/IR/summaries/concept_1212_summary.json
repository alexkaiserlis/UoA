  "summary": "The concept of \"war of independence\" pertains to conflicts aimed at achieving self-determination and sovereignty from colonial or foreign rule. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such wars often invoke international security considerations, necessitating the application of various legal instruments and treaties governing armed conflict and humanitarian law. The EU's approach to these conflicts emphasizes the importance of diplomacy, conflict resolution, and adherence to international norms. Furthermore, the EU may engage in peacekeeping missions or provide support to nations emerging from such wars, reinforcing its commitment to stability and security within the international community.",
