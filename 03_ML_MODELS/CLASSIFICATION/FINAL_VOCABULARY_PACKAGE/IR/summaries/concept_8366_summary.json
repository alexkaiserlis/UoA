  "summary": "The concept of \"countries of the Pacific Community\" pertains to the economic geography of the Pacific region, particularly focusing on states such as Papua New Guinea and Fiji. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these countries are often involved in negotiations for Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) under the ACP (African, Caribbean, and Pacific) grouping. Such agreements, concluded in conjunction with the EU, require consent from the respective states and are aimed at enhancing trade relations. The Lisbon Treaty has further facilitated these partnerships, allowing for new agreements to be laid down and followed by the European Parliament's decision-making process. Hereinafter, these agreements enter into force, promoting economic cooperation and development within the community of Pacific islands.",
