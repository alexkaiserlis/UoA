  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"white wine\" refers to a category of beverages produced primarily from the fermentation of grapes, necessitating precise standards for quality and preservation. Oenological practices in distilleries across regions such as the Loire are governed by regulations that address the distillation process, including the use of sulphur dioxide as a preservative. Growers must comply with contracts that specify delivery quantities and quality, while also facing insurmountable challenges related to climate change and market discrimination. The EU supports these growers through permits and reserves, ensuring that white wines marketed within the Union meet established proof and quality standards.",
