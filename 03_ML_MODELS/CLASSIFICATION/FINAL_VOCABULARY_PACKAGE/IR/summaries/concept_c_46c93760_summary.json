  "summary": "The concept of \"food systems\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses the intricate networks involved in food production, processing, distribution, and consumption. It is pivotal in addressing public health, sustainability, and food security. The EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and various health regulations aim to promote safe, nutritious food while minimizing environmental impacts. Furthermore, food systems are integral to the EU's Green Deal, which seeks to enhance biodiversity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By fostering resilient food systems, the EU aims to ensure food safety and quality, aligning with its broader health and environmental objectives.",
