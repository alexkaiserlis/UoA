  "summary": "The \"common tariff policy\" is a fundamental aspect of the EU's 2011 tariff policy framework, designed to ensure predictability and uniformity in trade relations. It culminates in the establishment of a cohesive tariff structure that applies bilaterally to member states, thereby enhancing economic integration. This policy addresses various goods, including semiconductors and chicory, while also considering the implications of nullification and retaliation in trade disputes. By modernised approaches, the EU aims to avoid onerous barriers that could impair trade. The policy's enforcement is crucial for maintaining a depository of authenticated trade agreements, ensuring compliance and fulfillment of international obligations, while also addressing concerns regarding inhuman or degrading treatment in trade practices.",
