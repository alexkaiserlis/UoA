  "summary": "Circular migration refers to a legal framework within the EU that facilitates the temporary movement of individuals between their home countries and EU member states for work or study purposes. This concept aims to enhance mutual benefits for both the migrants and the host countries, promoting cultural exchange and addressing labor shortages. Circular migration is distinguished from permanent migration, as it allows for the return of migrants to their countries of origin after a defined period. The EU's regulatory approach emphasizes the need for coherence in migration policies, ensuring that circular migration aligns with broader objectives of sustainable development and social integration.",
