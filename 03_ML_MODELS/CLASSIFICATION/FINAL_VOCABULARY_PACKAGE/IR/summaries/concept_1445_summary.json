  "summary": "Veterinary inspection is a critical component of EU agricultural policy, ensuring the health and safety of live animals and animal products. This process encompasses the monitoring of diseases such as isavirus and prrs, which can lead to debilitating conditions in livestock, including abortions and subclinical infections. Inspections are conducted in various regions, including zachodniopomorskie and małopolskie, to ensure compliance with health regulations. The role of veterinary inspectors includes assessing the pharmacodynamic properties of veterinary medicines and ensuring that untested substances, like bisulphate, are not administered. Additionally, they oversee itineraries for travelers transporting live animals, ensuring adherence to guidelines that prevent the spread of pathogens from orthomyxoviridae. The integration of advanced methodologies, such as monotiring, enhances the efficacy of these inspections, contributing to overall bee_health_en and animal welfare across the EU.",
