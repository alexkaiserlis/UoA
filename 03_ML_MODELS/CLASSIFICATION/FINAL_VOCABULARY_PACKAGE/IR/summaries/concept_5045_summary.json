  "summary": "Sulphuric acid, a dominant inorganic acid, plays a critical role in various EU regulatory contexts, particularly in the production of fertilizers, detergents, and paint. Its significance outstrips many competing chemicals, making it advantageous for haulage and terminal operations. The EU negotiates strict regulations to assure safe handling and storage of sulphuric acid, especially at dockside terminals where cargo is frequently resold. Discontinuation of certain uses may occur as environmental intentions evolve. The alteration of regulations often commences with consultations involving indigenous stakeholders. As industries renew their practices, the optimum use of sulphuric acid remains a focal point, ensuring compliance while addressing safety and environmental concerns.",
