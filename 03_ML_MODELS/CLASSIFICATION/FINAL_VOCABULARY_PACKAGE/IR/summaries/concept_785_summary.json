  "summary": "The concept of \"free education\" within the EU legal framework emphasizes the right to receive educational services without tuition fees, facilitating the integration of children, including migrants, into the host country's educational system. This principle is designed to promote social inclusion and cultural diversity, ensuring that all children, regardless of their origin, are able to access suitable educational environments. Various directives and resolutions outline actions that member states must take to improve educational conditions, particularly for disadvantaged groups. The EU prioritizes educational programmes that enhance language skills and teaching quality, thereby reinforcing the freedom of movement and integration of workers and their families.",
