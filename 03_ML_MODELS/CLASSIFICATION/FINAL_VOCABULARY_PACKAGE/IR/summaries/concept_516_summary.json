  "summary": "The \"right to trial,\" also referred to as the \"right to justice,\" is a fundamental legal principle enshrined in EU law, ensuring that individuals, including minors, receive thorough and impartial adjudication of their disputes. This right manifests through various remedies that dissuade infringements on freedoms, particularly in the context of digital commerce and intellectual property. It recognizes disparities in access to justice, facilitating equitable outcomes for all peoples. The EU framework encodes protections against illicit practices, ensuring that providers of services, including audiovisual broadcasting, are held accountable for breaches. This right underscores the importance of pluralism and expression in a democratic society.",
