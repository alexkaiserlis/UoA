  "summary": "A \"blank ballot paper\" refers to a voting instrument that is intentionally left unmarked by the voter. In the context of EU electoral procedures, the use of blank ballot papers is significant as it reflects the voter's choice to abstain from expressing a preference for any candidate or party. This practice is governed by various regulations aimed at ensuring the integrity and transparency of the electoral process. Blank ballots are typically counted separately to provide insights into voter sentiment and participation rates. Understanding the implications of blank ballot papers is essential for analyzing electoral outcomes and enhancing democratic engagement within the EU.",
