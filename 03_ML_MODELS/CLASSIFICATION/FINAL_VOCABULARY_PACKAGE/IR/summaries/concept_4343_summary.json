  "summary": "The concept of \"population overcrowding,\" redirected to \"overpopulation,\" pertains to demographic challenges within the European Union. Overpopulation signifies a condition where the number of individuals exceeds the capacity of a given area to sustain them, leading to significant socio-economic and environmental pressures. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, overpopulation is addressed through policies aimed at sustainable development, urban planning, and resource management. The EU emphasizes the need for balanced population distribution to mitigate adverse effects such as strain on public services, housing shortages, and environmental degradation. Effective management of overpopulation is essential for fostering social cohesion and ensuring long-term sustainability.",
