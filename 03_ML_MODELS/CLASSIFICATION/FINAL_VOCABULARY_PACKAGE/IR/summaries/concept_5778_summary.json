  "summary": "The \"Mercosur countries\" refer to the member states of the Southern Common Market, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, with Venezuela's membership currently suspended. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, Mercosur represents a significant economic bloc with which the EU seeks to enhance trade relations through agreements aimed at reducing tariffs and fostering economic cooperation. The EU's engagement with Mercosur is pivotal for aligning regulatory standards and promoting sustainable development, particularly in areas such as environmental protection and labor rights. This relationship underscores the EU's commitment to multilateralism and regional integration in global economic governance.",
