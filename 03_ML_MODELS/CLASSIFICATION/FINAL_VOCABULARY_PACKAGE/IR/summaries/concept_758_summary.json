  "summary": "The Eurovoc concept \"children,\" redirecting to the preferred term \"child,\" encompasses a demographic category crucial in EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Children, often viewed as vulnerable, face various challenges, including emotional and physical infirmity. Regulations aim to childproof environments, mitigating risks such as strangulation from corded drapery or suffocation due to constricted windpipes. The EU emphasizes the importance of safeguarding children's rights, addressing issues like hospitalisation and the scourge of neglect. Legal frameworks also consider the substitutability of resources for children's welfare, ensuring access to safe, age-appropriate products, from timepieces to educational materials, fostering their holistic development.",
