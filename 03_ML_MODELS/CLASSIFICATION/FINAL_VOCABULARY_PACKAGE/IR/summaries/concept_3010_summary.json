  "summary": "The concept of \"email,\" redirected to the preferred term \"electronic mail,\" is integral to EU communications, particularly in regulatory frameworks. It encompasses messaging systems that are processable and interoperable across various telecommunication networks. The European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services (ERGA) and the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) emphasize the importance of secure, trusted electronic mail systems to prevent unauthorized tampering and ensure legibility of messages. Regulatory bodies also advise on the use of electronic signatures and the management of data, such as fingerprints in systems like Eurodac, to enhance security and compliance. As telematic communication evolves, the need for effective forecasting and blocking mechanisms becomes increasingly demanding, ensuring that electronic mail remains a reliable tool for communication within the EU.",
