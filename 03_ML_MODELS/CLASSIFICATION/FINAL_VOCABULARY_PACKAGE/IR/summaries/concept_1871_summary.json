  "summary": "The \"Baltic Sea\" is a critical natural environment within the EU, subject to various legal and regulatory frameworks aimed at sustainable management of its resources. Key issues include the misreporting of fish stocks, such as clupea harengus and turbot, which impacts livelihoods of fishers in ports like Gdynia and Gdansk. Regulatory measures address highgrading and the discarding of species like flounder and sprat, emphasizing selectivity in fishing practices. The EU's Baltic Sea strategy promotes the regeneration of fish populations through initiatives like tagging and monitoring of smolt and alfonsinos. Additionally, the management of IUU (Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated) fishing is crucial for maintaining the ecological balance and ensuring the survivability of flatfish and other species. The integration of aquaculture practices and the minimization of entangling gear, such as fyke and pots, are essential for sustainable exploitation of this vital marine ecosystem.",
