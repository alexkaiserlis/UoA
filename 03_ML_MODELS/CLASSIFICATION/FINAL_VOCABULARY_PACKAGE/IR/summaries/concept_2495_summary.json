  "summary": "The concept of \"credit volume,\" categorized under financial institutions and credit, is a redirect to the preferred term \"credit policy.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, credit policy encompasses the strategic guidelines and measures that govern the allocation and management of credit within the financial system. It plays a crucial role in ensuring financial stability, influencing lending practices, and regulating the flow of capital. By establishing parameters for credit volume, EU institutions aim to mitigate risks associated with excessive borrowing and promote sustainable economic growth. Thus, understanding credit policy is essential for compliance with EU regulations and fostering a resilient financial environment.",
