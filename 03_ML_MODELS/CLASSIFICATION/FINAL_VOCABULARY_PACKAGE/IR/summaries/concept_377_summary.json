  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"consumer demand\" pertains to the need for products that meet specific quality and regional characteristics, particularly in the wine sector. The EU stipulates that wines must satisfy qualitative requisites, which include indications of geographical origin, such as \"vino\" or \"vin,\" and the designation of \"landwein\" for certain varieties. Governments are tasked with granting authorizations for planting vines in specified areas, ensuring that production exceeds demand while maintaining authenticity. Applications for recognition of regional wines undergo scrutiny to ensure they fulfill the requisite standards, thereby supporting consumer preferences for high-quality, typical products from designated regions, such as Spain.",
