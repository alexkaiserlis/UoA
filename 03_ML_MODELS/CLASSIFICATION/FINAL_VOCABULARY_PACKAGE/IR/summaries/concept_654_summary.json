  "summary": "A \"mixed economy\" refers to an economic structure that incorporates both private and public sector elements, facilitating a blend of market-driven and government-regulated activities. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, mixed economies are significant as they allow for the coexistence of free enterprise and state intervention, promoting social welfare while ensuring competitive markets. This dual approach enables member states to address economic disparities and enhance public services, aligning with the EU's objectives of cohesion and sustainable development. The mixed economy model is pivotal in shaping policies that balance economic efficiency with social equity across the Union.",
