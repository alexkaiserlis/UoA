  "summary": "The concept of \"self-sufficiency in food\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks constitutes a strategic aim to ensure that member states can efficiently manage their food supply. This involves developing integrated policies and multiannual programmes aimed at improving food security and enabling a steady flow of deliveries to recipients. The EU undertakes various projects and agreements that link humanitarian aid with agricultural strategies, thereby replacing reliance on external sources. By improving overall capacities and ensuring conformity with established standards, the EU seeks to enhance its interests in food supply, thereby allowing member states to participate fully in achieving greater self-sufficiency.",
