  "summary": "The concept of \"seasonal work,\" redirected to \"seasonal employment,\" pertains to employment arrangements that arise during specific periods of the year, often linked to agricultural, tourism, or other cyclical industries. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, seasonal employment is governed by directives that ensure fair treatment and protection of workers' rights. These regulations address issues such as working conditions, remuneration, and social security entitlements for seasonal workers. The EU emphasizes the importance of harmonizing these standards across member states to promote equitable labor practices and facilitate the mobility of seasonal workers within the internal market.",
