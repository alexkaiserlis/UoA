  "summary": "\"Middle-water fishing,\" a term redirected to \"deep-sea fishing,\" encompasses fishing practices targeting species in deeper marine environments, often around seamounts and hydrothermal vents. In the EU regulatory framework, this practice is scrutinized due to its potential for destructive impacts on ecosystems, including irreparable damage to coral reefs and sponge beds. The EU emphasizes cautious management of these fisheries to conserve depleted stocks, such as roundnose grenadier and roughy, while addressing the livelihoods of local communities. Unsustainable practices, particularly by flagged trawlers and seiners, necessitate particularised regulations to prevent overfishing and ensure the abundance of straddling species like sharks and seabream.",
