  "summary": "Document indexing is a crucial process in the context of EU legal and regulatory documentation, facilitating the systematic organization and retrieval of texts. This process involves assigning specific identifiers or metadata to documents, enabling efficient access to legislative texts, directives, and regulations. Effective document indexing enhances the transparency and accessibility of EU law, allowing stakeholders, including legal practitioners and policymakers, to navigate complex regulatory frameworks. By employing standardized indexing methods, the EU ensures that relevant documents are easily locatable, thereby supporting informed decision-making and compliance with legal obligations across member states.",
