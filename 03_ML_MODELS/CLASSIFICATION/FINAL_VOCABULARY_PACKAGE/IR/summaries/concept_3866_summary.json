  "summary": "In the context of EU law, a \"sanction\" serves as a crucial mechanism for enforcing compliance and deterring offences that impinge upon the integrity of the Union. Sanctions can be applied to states or entities that breach established regulations, thereby accentuating the importance of adherence to EU principles. The legal framework governing sanctions is interlinked with macroprudential policies, which aim to uphold financial stability. As the EU navigates the complexities of democratization and electoral integrity, sanctions may also play a role in addressing divergences in member state practices. The reactivation of sanctions can occur when unauthorized actions are identified, reflecting a durable commitment to rule of law. By summarizing the implications of sanctions, the EU seeks to promote stronger governance and mitigate irrecoverable damages caused by non-compliance.",
