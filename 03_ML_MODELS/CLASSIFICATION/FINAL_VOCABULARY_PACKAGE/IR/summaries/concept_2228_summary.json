  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"pulp\" is a term that subsumes various processes and materials related to the wood industry, specifically in the production of \"paper.\" This encompasses the pulping of coniferous and deciduous trees, which results in substrates for diverse applications, including lightweight stationery, notebooks, and newsprint. The production process often involves the use of kraft methods and may include additives such as lignin and clay for improved quality. Regulatory frameworks may address environmental impacts, including the use of watermarks and the recycling of shredded paper. Ecolabels are increasingly relevant, ensuring products meet sustainability standards.",
