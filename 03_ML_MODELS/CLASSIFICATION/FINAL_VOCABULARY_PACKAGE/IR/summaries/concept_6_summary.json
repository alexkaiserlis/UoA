  "summary": "Wholesale trade, categorized under distributive trades, encompasses the sale of goods in large quantities, primarily to retailers or other businesses rather than to end consumers. This sector has been remodelled to adapt to market dynamics, including the liberalisation of trade practices across the EU. Wholesalers, such as independents and entities like Veba, engage in aggregating products, which can include items like briquettes from the Ruhr area or pharmaceuticals from Darmstadt. The regulatory framework entitles wholesalers to exploit market opportunities while ensuring compliance with EU directives. Notably, the shrinkage of traditional retail channels has reigned in new wholesaling strategies, impacting regions like Hesse and Mannheim.",
