  "summary": "The concept of \"social rights\" within the EU legal framework encompasses a range of entitlements aimed at ensuring dignity, equality, and social justice for individuals. These rights are integral to the EU's commitment to uphold fundamental freedoms and promote social cohesion among Member States. Social rights include access to education, healthcare, and social security, reflecting the EU's dedication to enhancing the quality of life for its citizens. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union explicitly recognizes these rights, emphasizing their importance in fostering a fair and inclusive society. Thus, social rights are pivotal in shaping EU policies and regulatory measures.",
