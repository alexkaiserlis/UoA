  "summary": "The concept of \"term of office,\" redirected to \"elective office,\" pertains to the duration and conditions under which officials, such as members of the European Parliament, serve in their roles. This mandate is crucial for ensuring independence and cohesion within the EU's governance framework. The length of the term is often set to five years, with provisions for renewal or replacement, thereby limiting unnecessary disruptions in function. Committees, chaired by appointed officials, play a vital role in steering legislative designs. The wording of regulations emphasises confidentiality and accountability, ensuring that the responsibilities of these elected representatives are correctly fulfilled throughout their consecutive terms.",
