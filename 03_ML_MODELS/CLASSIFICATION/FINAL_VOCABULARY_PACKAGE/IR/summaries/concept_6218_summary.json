  "summary": "The concept of \"EU policy - national policy\" encapsulates the dynamic interplay between European Union regulations and member states' domestic policies. It highlights how national policies must align with overarching EU objectives, ensuring coherence in governance and regulatory frameworks. This relationship is crucial for the effective implementation of EU directives and regulations, as it fosters a unified approach to issues such as trade, environmental standards, and social rights. The redirect from \"national policy-Community policy\" to \"EU policy - national policy\" underscores the necessity of integrating national interests within the broader context of EU legislation, promoting synergy and compliance across member states.",
