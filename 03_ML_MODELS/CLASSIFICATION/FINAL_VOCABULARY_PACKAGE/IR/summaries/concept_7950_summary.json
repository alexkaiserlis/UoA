  "summary": "The concept of \"web address,\" redirected to the preferred term \"Internet address,\" is crucial in EU legal and regulatory frameworks concerning digital communications. This term encompasses various elements, including top-level domains (TLDs) and country code top-level domains (ccTLDs), which are managed by registrars and registries. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) supervises the allocation and management of these domains, ensuring compliance with GAC guidelines. Queries related to domain registration and revocation processes are vital for maintaining online visibility and privacy. The regulatory landscape also addresses abusive practices and the need for a scorecard approach to evaluate domain management, enhancing the overall topology of the Internet.",
