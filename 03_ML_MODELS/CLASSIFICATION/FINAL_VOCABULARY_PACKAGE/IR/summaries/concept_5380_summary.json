  "summary": "The term \"champagne\" refers to a specific category of sparkling wine produced in the Champagne region of France, which is protected under EU law. The European Union has established stringent regulations governing the production, labeling, and marketing of champagne to ensure its authenticity and quality. This includes adherence to the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) standards, which dictate the geographical boundaries, grape varieties, and production methods. The protection of the term \"champagne\" is vital for maintaining its reputation and preventing misleading practices. As such, it is classified under beverages and sugar, reflecting its significance in EU agricultural and trade policies.",
