  "summary": "The concept of \"law in war,\" redirected to \"international humanitarian law,\" encompasses the legal frameworks governing the conduct of armed conflict and the protection of individuals. Within the EU legal and regulatory context, international humanitarian law is pivotal in ensuring compliance with treaties and conventions that safeguard human rights during warfare. It delineates the obligations of states and non-state actors, emphasizing the principles of distinction, proportionality, and necessity. The EU actively promotes adherence to these legal standards, reinforcing its commitment to international security and humanitarian principles, thereby enhancing the protection of civilians and combatants alike in conflict situations.",
