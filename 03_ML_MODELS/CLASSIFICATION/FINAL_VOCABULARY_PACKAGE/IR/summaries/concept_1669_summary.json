  "summary": "The term \"slab\" in the context of EU legal and regulatory documents is a redirect to the preferred term \"ingot.\" Both terms refer to a semi-finished metal product, typically produced through casting processes. In regulatory frameworks concerning technology and technical regulations, the classification of materials such as slabs or ingots is crucial for compliance with standards related to manufacturing, safety, and environmental impact. Understanding the nuances between these terms aids in the precise application of regulations governing the production and trade of metal products within the EU, ensuring adherence to established technical specifications and quality assurance protocols.",
