  "summary": "The concept of \"government-in-exile\" refers to a political entity that operates outside its home territory, typically due to the occupation or overthrow of its legitimate authority. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a government-in-exile may seek recognition from the European Union and its member states, advocating for support in restoring democratic governance. This status can influence international relations, humanitarian aid, and diplomatic negotiations. The EU's approach to governments-in-exile is guided by principles of legitimacy, sovereignty, and human rights, ensuring that such entities align with the EU's foundational values and objectives in promoting stability and democracy in affected regions.",
