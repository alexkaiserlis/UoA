  "summary": "Non-motorised transport refers to modes of transportation that do not rely on motorized vehicles, such as walking, cycling, and the use of non-motorized vehicles like scooters and skateboards. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, non-motorised transport is increasingly recognized for its role in promoting sustainable mobility, reducing carbon emissions, and enhancing urban livability. The European Union encourages member states to integrate non-motorised transport into their transport policies, emphasizing the need for infrastructure development, safety regulations, and public awareness campaigns. This concept aligns with broader EU objectives to foster environmentally friendly transport solutions and improve overall transport organization.",
