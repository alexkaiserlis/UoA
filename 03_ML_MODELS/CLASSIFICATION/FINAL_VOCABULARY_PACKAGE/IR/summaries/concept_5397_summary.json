  "summary": "The term \"boiler\" refers to a critical component in mechanical engineering, specifically within the context of energy production and thermal efficiency. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, boilers are subject to stringent standards aimed at ensuring safety, efficiency, and environmental sustainability. The Ecodesign Directive and Energy Labelling Regulation establish requirements for the design and performance of boilers, promoting the use of high-efficiency models to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Compliance with these regulations is essential for manufacturers and importers, as non-compliance can lead to penalties and market restrictions. Thus, the regulation of boilers is integral to the EU's broader environmental objectives.",
