The European Union recognizes the significance of religious tourism in promoting intercultural dialogue and fostering community cohesion. Regulatory measures may address issues such as accessibility, environmental sustainability, and the protection of cultural assets associated with religious sites. Additionally, the EU may support initiatives that enhance the experience of religious tourists while ensuring compliance with relevant legal standards and social affairs objectives.",
