  "summary": "Town-planning regulations are essential legal frameworks governing land use and development within urban areas across the European Union. These regulations ensure that construction projects comply with zoning laws, environmental standards, and community needs. They facilitate orderly urban development, promote sustainable practices, and protect public interests. In the EU context, town-planning regulations are influenced by directives and policies aimed at harmonizing urban development across member states. They encompass various aspects, including building codes, land allocation, and infrastructure planning, thereby playing a crucial role in shaping the spatial organization and functionality of towns and cities within the EU.",
