  "summary": "The \"launching of a product\" refers to the process by which a new product is introduced into the market, a critical phase in marketing strategies governed by EU regulations. This concept encompasses various legal considerations, including compliance with consumer protection laws, intellectual property rights, and advertising standards. In the EU, the launching of a product must adhere to the principles of transparency and fairness, ensuring that consumers are adequately informed about the product's features and risks. Regulatory frameworks, such as the General Product Safety Directive, play a vital role in overseeing this process, safeguarding public interests while fostering innovation and competition within the internal market.",
