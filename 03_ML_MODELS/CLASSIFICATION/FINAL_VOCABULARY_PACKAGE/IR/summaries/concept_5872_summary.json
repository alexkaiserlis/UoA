  "summary": "The \"revision of financial perspectives\" refers to the interinstitutional agreement (IIA) process aimed at modernisation and reform of the EU's multiannual financial framework (MFF). This revision addresses challenges such as the need for sustainable finance and the modulation of appropriations to ensure sound budgetary discipline. It encompasses commitments to strengthen infrastructures, particularly in rural and broadband projects, while raising ceilings for various subheadings. The trilogue negotiations facilitate a joint approach to offset decreasing funding in certain areas, ensuring solidarity among member states. Ultimately, this revision aims to keep the EU's financial tools aligned with evolving policies and recovery objectives.",
