  "summary": "The concept of \"pine tree,\" categorized under forestry, is redirected to the preferred term \"conifer,\" encompassing various species within the Coniferae family. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, conifers like Abies, Picea, and Larix are crucial for sustainable forestry practices, including lumber production and habitat preservation. Regulations may address issues such as the infestation of scolytidae, which intensifies the need for effective management strategies. Additionally, practices like transplanting and repotting are regulated to ensure the biological integrity of ecosystems. The legal framework also considers the ecological roles of conifers, including nesting habitats for diverse species and the use of thicker collars for tree protection against pests.",
