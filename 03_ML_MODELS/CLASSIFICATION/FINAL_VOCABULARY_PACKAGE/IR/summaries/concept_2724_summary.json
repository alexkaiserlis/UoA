  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"productivity\" serves as a cornerstone for economic growth and stability, emphasizing the need for modernising infrastructures and skills. The concept is crucial in formulating guidelines that aim to enhance adaptability and exploit synergies among various sectors. By systematically addressing backwardness and retaining a focus on economically viable practices, the EU seeks to attract investments and improve benchmarks for productivity. Initiatives such as flexicurity are designed to support the unemployed, amplifying their skills and matching them with job opportunities. Additionally, the emphasis on saving energies and reducing greenhouse gases reflects a prudent approach to sustainable development, aligning with global commitments made in forums like Copenhagen and Rio.",
