  "summary": "Market enlargement within the EU trade policy context refers to the strategic initiative aimed at expanding market access and fostering international trade relations. This concept necessitates a reasoned approach to lowering barriers and promoting equitable competition among contractors. By stimulating promotional campaigns and executing agreements, the EU seeks to widen its market presence and gather support from member states. The involvement of stakeholders is crucial, as misinterpretation of regulations can lead to clashes in responsibilities. Consequently, the EU institutes measures that ensure the admissibility of foreign products while precluding unfair practices. Such efforts are essential for the accomplishment of trade objectives and the prolongation of economic growth.",
