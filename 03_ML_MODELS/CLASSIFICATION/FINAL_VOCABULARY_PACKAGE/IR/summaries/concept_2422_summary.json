  "summary": "A \"political programme\" is a foundational document that outlines the objectives, principles, and strategies of a political party within the European Union. It serves as a guiding framework for the party's activities, articulating its stance on various legislative and regulatory issues. In the context of EU legal documents, a political programme is crucial for understanding a party's electoral manifesto and its alignment with EU values, such as democracy and rule of law. This document also plays a significant role in the political landscape, influencing party cohesion and voter engagement during elections, thereby shaping the broader EU policy discourse.",
