  "summary": "The Eurovoc concept \"youth,\" redirecting to the preferred term \"young person,\" encompasses a demographic category crucial in EU legal and regulatory frameworks. This concept addresses the multifaceted challenges faced by minors, including emotional and psychological injuries, often perpetrated through violence and trafficking. Initiatives like the Daphne Programme advocate for the dignity and rights of young beings, fostering community engagement and multidisciplinary approaches. The EU promotes tangible solutions through networking and exchanging ideas, bolstered by foundations and NGOs. By understanding the essence of youth, the EU aims to curb the scourge of social issues, ensuring that young persons acquire the abilities necessary for a secure future.",
