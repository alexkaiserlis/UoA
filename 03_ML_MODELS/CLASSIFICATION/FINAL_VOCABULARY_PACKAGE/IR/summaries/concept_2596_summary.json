  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"tilling\" is a term that redirects to \"soil preparation,\" a critical process in the cultivation of agricultural land (category 5621). Soil preparation encompasses various practices aimed at enhancing soil structure and fertility, thereby optimizing agricultural productivity. The EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) emphasizes sustainable soil management, which includes effective tilling techniques that minimize soil erosion and degradation. Regulations may stipulate specific tilling methods to ensure compliance with environmental standards, promoting biodiversity and soil health. Understanding the nuances of soil preparation is essential for farmers and policymakers to align agricultural practices with EU sustainability goals.",
