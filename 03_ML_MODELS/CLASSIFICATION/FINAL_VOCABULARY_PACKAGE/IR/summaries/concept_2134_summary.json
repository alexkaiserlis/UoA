  "summary": "An oligopoly is a market structure characterized by a limited number of firms that dominate the market, leading to reduced competition. In the context of EU competition law, oligopolistic behavior can raise concerns regarding anti-competitive practices, such as collusion or price-fixing, which may infringe upon Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The European Commission actively monitors oligopolistic markets to ensure compliance with competition regulations, promoting fair competition and consumer welfare. Effective regulatory oversight is essential to mitigate the risks associated with oligopolies, fostering a competitive environment that benefits both consumers and the economy.",
