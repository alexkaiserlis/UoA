  "summary": "The concept of \"language policy\" within the EU legal framework encompasses the freedoms and rights of individuals and parties in relation to language use in various fields. It is attached to specific provisions within agreements and regulations that aim to extend cooperation among member states. The language policy is implemented through articles in official documents, including amendments and proposals adopted by the Parliament and the Council. This policy includes arrangements concerning the functioning of the European Economic Area (EEA) and is reflected in decisions made by the Commission. The joint position of the parties involved is crucial for ensuring that language rights are appropriately addressed in all relevant areas.",
