  "summary": "The concept of \"land forces\" pertains to military capabilities specifically deployed on terrestrial terrain, forming a critical component of national and collective defense strategies within the EU framework. In legal and regulatory contexts, land forces are often discussed in relation to the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), which aims to enhance the EU's ability to respond to crises. The deployment, coordination, and operational readiness of land forces are subject to various EU regulations and directives that govern defense cooperation among member states. This ensures interoperability, strategic alignment, and adherence to international law, thereby reinforcing the EU's commitment to maintaining peace and security.",
