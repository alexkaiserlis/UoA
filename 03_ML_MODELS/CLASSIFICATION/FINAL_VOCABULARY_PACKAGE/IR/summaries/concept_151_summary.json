  "summary": "The concept of \"control of constitutionality\" pertains to the judicial review process that ensures compliance of legislation with constitutional norms within the European Union. This mechanism is vital for upholding the rule of law and protecting fundamental rights. It allows courts to assess whether laws enacted by EU institutions or member states align with the principles enshrined in the EU treaties and national constitutions. The control of constitutionality serves as a safeguard against arbitrary governance, promoting legal certainty and stability within the EU legal framework. This process is essential for maintaining the integrity of the legal order and the democratic values of the Union.",
