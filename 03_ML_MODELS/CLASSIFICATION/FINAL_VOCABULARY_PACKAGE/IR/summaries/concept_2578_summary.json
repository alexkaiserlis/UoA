  "summary": "The \"right of initiative,\" also referred to as the \"power of initiative,\" is a crucial element within the EU political framework, empowering elected representatives and citizens to propose legislative changes. This process begins with organisers collecting signatures from at least one million citizens across several Member States, fulfilling a minimum requirement for registration. Once registered, initiatives are forwarded to the European Commission, which handles verification and communication. The Commission may then propose modifications or amendments to existing legislation, ensuring that the needs of citizens are addressed. This mechanism facilitates democratic participation, allowing citizens to influence EU policies effectively.",
