  "summary": "The concept of \"soft technology\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework refers to non-material innovations that enhance processes, systems, and methodologies, particularly in the context of technology and technical regulations. Unlike hard technologies, which involve physical devices, soft technologies emphasize knowledge transfer, organizational practices, and collaborative frameworks. The EU recognizes the importance of soft technology in fostering innovation, improving efficiency, and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. This concept is pivotal in shaping policies that encourage sustainable development and competitiveness in the digital economy, aligning with the EU's strategic objectives for technological advancement and regulatory coherence.",
