  "summary": "The concept of \"control of communications\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to the oversight and regulation of telecommunication networks and services. This includes ensuring compliance with directives aimed at safeguarding consumer rights, promoting competition, and protecting privacy. The control mechanisms may involve monitoring practices to prevent abuse, ensuring transparency, and fostering an environment conducive to innovation. Regulatory bodies, such as the European Commission and national authorities, play pivotal roles in enforcing these regulations, thereby enhancing the integrity and reliability of communications across member states. This concept is integral to the EU's broader objectives of digital single market and data protection.",
