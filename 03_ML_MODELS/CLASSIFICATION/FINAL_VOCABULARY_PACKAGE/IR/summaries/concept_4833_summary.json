  "summary": "The concept of \"industrial fittings,\" redirected to \"industrial building,\" encompasses structures integral to various industrial processes within the EU regulatory framework. These buildings often incorporate advanced technologies, such as turbines and combustion systems, necessitating compliance with environmental standards, including desulphurisation and NOx emissions limits. Regulatory documents frequently require entities to submit templates for emissions reporting, ensuring the correctness and completeness of data in registries. Inconsistent reporting can jeopardise entitlements under the Kyoto Protocol, demanding recalculations and explanations for discrepancies. As industrial buildings evolve, the aggregation of emissions data and the linking of thermal efficiency metrics become crucial for compliance and sustainability, particularly in the context of biomass and stationary sources.",
