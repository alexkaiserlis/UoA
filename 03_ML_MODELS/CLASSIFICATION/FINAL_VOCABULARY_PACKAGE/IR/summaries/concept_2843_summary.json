  "summary": "The concept of \"protection of mothers,\" redirected to \"care of mothers and infants,\" encompasses various EU legal and regulatory frameworks aimed at promoting equality and safeguarding the rights of women during pregnancy and motherhood. This includes binding provisions that confer equal opportunities in employment, ensuring that workers, including mothers and their spouses, are engaged in vocational training and activities that respect their integral roles. The EU pursues progressive actions that address differences in treatment and pay, thereby fostering a supportive environment for mothers. Such regulations are classified under health and employment, reflecting a commitment to the well-being of families and the promotion of self-capacity among women.",
