  "summary": "The \"law of obligations\" is a fundamental aspect of civil law within the EU, encompassing contractual and non-contractual obligations that create enforceable claims between parties. Established through various protocols and documents, including the Rome I Regulation, this body of law adapts to the needs of member states, such as Ireland and the United Kingdom, following their accession. It contains standards for the enforcement of obligations, ensuring that parties can participate in a predictable legal framework. The adoption of these laws is crucial for maintaining positive relationships in commercial contexts, as they replace outdated provisions and provide a clear procedure for claims.",
