  "summary": "The Eurovoc concept \"men,\" categorized under demography and population, serves as a redirect to the preferred term \"man.\" In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the term \"man\" encompasses not only biological aspects but also sociocultural dimensions relevant to gender representation and equality. This concept is pivotal in discussions surrounding demographic statistics, labor market policies, and social inclusion initiatives. Understanding the implications of \"man\" within these contexts aids in the formulation of regulations that promote gender equity and address demographic challenges faced by the EU. Thus, the term \"man\" is integral to the legal discourse on population dynamics and societal structures.",
