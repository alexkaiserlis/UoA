  "summary": "The concept of \"building performance\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework encompasses the assessment of a building's energy efficiency, sustainability, and overall functionality. It is integral to various directives, such as the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), which mandates member states to establish minimum energy performance requirements. This concept is pivotal in promoting environmentally friendly construction practices and ensuring compliance with EU sustainability goals. By evaluating building performance, the EU aims to enhance energy conservation, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and foster the development of resilient infrastructure, thus aligning with broader environmental and economic objectives.",
