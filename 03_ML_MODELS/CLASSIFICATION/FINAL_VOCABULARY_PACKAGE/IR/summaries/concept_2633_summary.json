  "summary": "The term \"bracket price\" refers to a regulatory pricing mechanism within EU legal frameworks, particularly in the context of agricultural and market policies. It establishes a price range, or bracket, within which market prices are expected to fluctuate. This concept is crucial for ensuring price stability and protecting producers from extreme market volatility. By setting a bracket price, the EU aims to facilitate fair competition and safeguard consumer interests. This mechanism is often employed in conjunction with other regulatory tools to promote market efficiency and transparency, thereby contributing to the overall integrity of the EU's internal market.",
