  "summary": "The term \"maritime area\" refers to the expansive regions of the sea that are subject to international law and regulation, particularly within the context of the European Union's legal framework. This concept encompasses various zones, including territorial waters, exclusive economic zones, and continental shelves, each governed by specific legal provisions. The EU's maritime policies aim to ensure sustainable use and protection of these areas, balancing economic activities such as fishing and shipping with environmental conservation. Understanding the legal status of the maritime area is crucial for compliance with international treaties and EU regulations, which seek to harmonize member states' maritime practices.",
