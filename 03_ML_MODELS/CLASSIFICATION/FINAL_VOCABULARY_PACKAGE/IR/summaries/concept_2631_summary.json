  "summary": "The concept of \"forfeiture of civil rights,\" also referred to as \"deprivation of rights,\" pertains to the legal consequences imposed on individuals following a criminal conviction within the EU framework. This regulatory measure may result in the loss of specific civil liberties, such as the right to vote or hold public office. The application of this concept varies across member states, reflecting differing national legal traditions. In EU legal documents, the term \"deprivation of rights\" is preferred, emphasizing its broader implications in criminal law. Understanding this concept is essential for assessing the balance between justice and individual rights in the EU legal landscape.",
