  "summary": "The concept of \"immediate effect,\" often referred to as \"direct applicability,\" is a fundamental principle in European Union law. It denotes the capacity of certain EU regulations and directives to confer rights and obligations upon individuals and entities without the need for national implementation. This principle ensures that EU law is uniformly applied across member states, promoting legal certainty and coherence within the internal market. The direct applicability of EU legislation facilitates immediate enforcement by national courts, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of EU law. As such, \"immediate effect\" underscores the supremacy of EU law in the legal hierarchy of member states.",
