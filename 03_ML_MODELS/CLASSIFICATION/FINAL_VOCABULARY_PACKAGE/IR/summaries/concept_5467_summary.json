  "summary": "The concept of \"tropical wood\" pertains to the wood industry, specifically focusing on logs and timber sourced from tropical forests. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the management and trade of tropical wood are subject to strict provisions aimed at sustainable forestry practices. The EU has revisited resolutions that prohibit the importation of illegally harvested timber, reinforcing a ban on unsustainable practices. This includes recommendations from international bodies like UNCTAD and the UNSCR, which presuppose the necessity for reform in logging practices. The EU's determination to renew and modify regulations ensures that tropical wood trade remains compliant with environmental standards, successfully addressing issues related to deforestation and illegal logging.",
