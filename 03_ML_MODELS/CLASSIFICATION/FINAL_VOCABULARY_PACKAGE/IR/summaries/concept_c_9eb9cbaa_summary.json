  "summary": "The concept of \"posting of workers\" refers to the temporary assignment of employees to work in a different EU Member State while maintaining their employment relationship in their home country. This practice is governed by EU regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and protecting workers' rights. The preferred term \"posted worker\" encapsulates individuals who are sent by their employer to perform services in another Member State. The legal framework, primarily established by Directive 96/71/EC and its amendments, mandates that posted workers receive certain rights and protections, including adherence to local labor laws regarding wages and working conditions.",
