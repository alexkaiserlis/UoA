  "summary": "Military sanctions refer to restrictive measures imposed by the European Union in response to violations of international law or threats to peace and security. These sanctions may include arms embargoes, restrictions on military cooperation, and asset freezes targeting individuals or entities involved in military activities that contravene EU policy. The legal framework for military sanctions is established through Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) regulations, which aim to uphold international norms and promote stability. Such measures are critical in the EU's external action strategy, reflecting its commitment to global security and the rule of law in international affairs.",
