  "summary": "The concept of \"joint authority\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to a collaborative governance structure where multiple entities exercise executive power and public service responsibilities. This arrangement is often established to enhance efficiency and accountability in decision-making processes, particularly in areas requiring coordinated action among member states or institutions. Joint authorities facilitate the implementation of EU policies by pooling resources and expertise, thereby ensuring compliance with legal obligations. This concept is crucial in sectors such as environmental regulation, where cross-border cooperation is essential for effective governance and sustainable development.",
