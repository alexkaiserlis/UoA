  "summary": "The concept of \"complementarity of trade\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to the principle that trade agreements and policies should enhance and support each other, fostering a cohesive international trade environment. This principle is crucial for ensuring that various trade regulations and agreements do not conflict but rather complement one another, promoting synergy among member states. By emphasizing complementarity, the EU aims to create a unified approach to international trade that aligns with its broader economic objectives, thereby enhancing competitiveness and facilitating smoother trade relations both within the EU and with external partners.",
