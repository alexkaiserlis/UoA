  "summary": "The concept of \"information technology\" encompasses a broad spectrum of tools and systems pivotal in the EU's legal and regulatory framework. It includes the use of cryptographic methods, such as domainkeys and dkim, for secure communications. The integration of extensible technologies, like ebxml and ubl, facilitates the replication and dissemination of data across globalised networks. Legal debates often hinge on the implications of scalable solutions in everyday applications, where computational efficiency is paramount. The IETF's RFCs provide foundational guidelines for protocols, while LDAP directories enhance data querying. As technology evolves, the EU must navigate the inextricable relationship between innovation and regulation, ensuring that procurers can effectively leverage these multipurpose tools while minimizing downtime and maintaining security.",
