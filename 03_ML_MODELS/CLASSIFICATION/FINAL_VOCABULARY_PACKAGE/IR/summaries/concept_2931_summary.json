  "summary": "The \"Euratom recommendation,\" also referred to as \"EAEC recommendation,\" is a regulatory instrument within the framework of the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC). This concept pertains to guidelines or suggestions issued by the Euratom institutions aimed at enhancing nuclear safety, promoting research, and ensuring the responsible use of nuclear energy across EU member states. As a non-binding directive, the recommendation serves to inform and influence national policies while fostering cooperation among member states in the field of nuclear energy.
