  "summary": "Discounting, in the context of EU financial institutions and credit regulation, refers to the practice of reducing the present value of future cash flows or receivables to account for the time value of money. This concept is crucial for assessing the viability of financial instruments and credit transactions. Regulatory frameworks within the EU, such as the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), often incorporate discounting methodologies to ensure transparency and risk assessment in financial reporting. Understanding discounting is essential for compliance with EU regulations, as it impacts credit risk evaluation and financial stability.",
