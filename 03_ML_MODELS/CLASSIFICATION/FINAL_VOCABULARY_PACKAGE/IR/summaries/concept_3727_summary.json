  "summary": "The Central American Common Market (CACM) is a regional integration initiative involving Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. Established to facilitate trade and economic cooperation among these countries, the CACM aims to create a centralized market by reducing tariffs and enhancing the movement of products. The concept encourages adaptations to administrative processes, allowing for the verification of the origin of goods and the acquisition of preferential treatment for originating products. This body serves as a platform for joint efforts in developing trade policies, thereby providing a framework for cooperation that aligns with EU legal standards and regulatory practices.",
