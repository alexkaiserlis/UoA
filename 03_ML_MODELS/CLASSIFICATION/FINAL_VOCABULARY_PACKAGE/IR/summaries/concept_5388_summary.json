  "summary": "The concept of \"axle weight\" pertains to the legal and regulatory framework governing the organization of transport within the European Union. It refers to the maximum permissible weight that can be applied to an axle of a vehicle, which is critical for ensuring road safety, infrastructure protection, and fair competition among transport operators. EU regulations, such as those outlined in Directive 96/53/EC, establish specific limits on axle weights to mitigate damage to road surfaces and enhance overall transport efficiency. Compliance with these regulations is essential for the legal operation of heavy goods vehicles across member states, fostering a harmonized transport environment.",
