  "summary": "Monetary cooperation within the EU framework involves the alignment and integration of national currencies and monetary policies to ensure stability and convertibility among member states. This cooperation is exemplified by the establishment of the euro, which replaced national currencies like the escudo and the dinar, creating a unified monetary facility. The European Central Bank (ECB) plays a primary role, deciding unanimously on monetary policies that conform to established statutes. Negotiations often imply modifications to existing frameworks, addressing obstacles such as differing inflation rates and currency parity. The implications of this cooperation extend to credit systems and the automatic adjustment of currencies in response to economic changes, ensuring a stable economic environment across the region.",
