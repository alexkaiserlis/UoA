  "summary": "Commercial arbitration refers to a method of resolving disputes arising from trade agreements and contracts outside of traditional court systems. Within the EU legal framework, it serves as a vital mechanism for enhancing trade policy by providing a neutral and efficient means for parties to settle conflicts. The regulatory landscape encourages the use of commercial arbitration to foster cross-border trade and investment, ensuring that disputes are resolved in a manner that respects the principles of fairness and impartiality. By promoting arbitration, the EU aims to create a more predictable legal environment, thereby facilitating smoother commercial interactions among member states.",
