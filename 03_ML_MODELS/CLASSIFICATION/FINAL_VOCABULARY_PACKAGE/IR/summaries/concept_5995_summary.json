  "summary": "The concept of \"circular\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to a directive or communication issued by executive authorities to provide guidance on the implementation of policies or regulations. Circulars serve as instruments for the dissemination of information, ensuring that public service entities adhere to established norms and standards. They facilitate the harmonization of practices across member states, promoting transparency and accountability in governance. By clarifying procedural requirements and expectations, circulars enhance the effectiveness of executive power in the EU, thereby reinforcing the rule of law and fostering cooperation among public service institutions.",
