  "summary": "Heavy fuel oil, often redirected to the preferred term \"fuel oil,\" is a significant component of the oil industry, particularly in the context of EU regulations addressing emissions and environmental impact. This viscous mixture, derived from the combustion of fossil fuels like lignite, contributes to ambient air pollution through the release of nitrogen oxides and particulates. Regulatory frameworks aim to monitor exceedances of pollutant loads, ensuring compliance with standards that protect ecosystems from acidification and deposition. The European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) plays a crucial role in mapping emissions and facilitating cooperative efforts to reduce thermal pollution. Legal measures also address the warehousing and handling of fuel oil, emphasizing the need for accurate measurements and digit tracking of combustion outputs to mitigate environmental risks.",
