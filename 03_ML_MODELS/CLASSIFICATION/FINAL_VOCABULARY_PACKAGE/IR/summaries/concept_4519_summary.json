  "summary": "The concept of \"international transport\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses a range of activities involving the movement of goods across borders, often facilitated by hauliers and shippers. This includes the use of waybills and the legalisation of transport documents, which uphold the rights of parties involved. The process may involve containerisation and the optimization of logistics, including the use of tachographs for monitoring. Crossfrontier transport can complicate regulatory compliance, necessitating equivalencies in standards. Additionally, the role of cargosharing and lowtonnage vessels is increasingly recognized. Legal frameworks address issues such as surcharges, liferafts for safety, and the responsibilities of plenipotentaries in international agreements, ensuring that transport remains buoyant and efficient.",
