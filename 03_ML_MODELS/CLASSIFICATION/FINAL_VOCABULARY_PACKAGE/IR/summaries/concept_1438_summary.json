  "summary": "A \"legislative initiative\" in the EU context refers to a formal procedure whereby citizens, through registered organisers, can propose modifications to existing legislation. This process is governed by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and requires the collection of signatures from a minimum of six member states. Once an initiative is registered, it is forwarded for verification and must fulfill specific criteria outlined in the relevant annexes. The European Commission is empowered to handle these initiatives, providing communication on their status and allowing for proposed amendments. This participatory mechanism facilitates citizen engagement in EU legislative processes.",
