  "summary": "The term \"greenhouse gas\" (GHG) refers to emissive substances that contribute to the deterioration of the environment, specifically through their role in climate change. In the EU regulatory framework, GHGs such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and trifluoromethane are subject to stringent controls and abating measures. The European Climate Change Programme (ECCP) promotes tradable emissions allowances, facilitating auctioneer-led markets where developers can engage in carbon trading. This monetisation strategy aims to enhance affordability and incentivize the reduction of GHG emissions. Regulatory bodies utilize polynomial models to assess emissions, ensuring compliance and fostering sustainable practices across industries.",
