  "summary": "The Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) is a pivotal regional trade agreement that facilitates economic cooperation and trade liberalization among its member states. Established to enhance trade relations, CEFTA plays a significant role in aligning the regulatory frameworks of its members with EU standards, thereby promoting integration into the European single market. As a legal instrument, CEFTA aims to reduce tariffs and eliminate trade barriers, fostering a conducive environment for investment and economic growth. This agreement is particularly relevant for countries in Central and Eastern Europe seeking to harmonize their trade policies with EU regulations, thus supporting broader European integration efforts.",
