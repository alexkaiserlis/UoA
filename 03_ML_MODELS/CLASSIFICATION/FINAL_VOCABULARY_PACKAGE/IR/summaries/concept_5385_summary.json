  "summary": "The concept of \"sweetening of wine,\" commonly referred to as \"chaptalisation,\" pertains to the legal practice of enriching musts with sugar to enhance the alcoholic strength of wines. This process is particularly relevant in regions where rainfall and sunshine conditions yield poor grape quality, necessitating intervention to ensure acceptable wine production. EU regulations address the necessity for precise supervision of chaptalisation, controlling its application to prevent ineffective practices. Notices are issued to communicate the conditions under which this enrichment is authorized, particularly in zones with abnormally low temperatures. Such regulations aim to maintain the integrity of wine varieties while supporting wholesale turnover and quality assurance.",
