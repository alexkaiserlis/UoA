  "summary": "A \"multinational enterprise\" refers to a business entity that operates in multiple countries, often necessitating complex legal and regulatory frameworks. In the EU context, such enterprises face imperative discussions regarding taxation, job creation, and compliance with treaties. The reorganisation of multinationals can lead to abrupt changes, potentially resulting in the cessation of operations in certain jurisdictions. This raises concerns about the repercussions of dismantling established centres, which could distort local economies. The EU's approach aims to balance the need for economic growth with the urgency of avoiding harmful practices. Authorisations and regulatory decrees are crucial in maintaining confidence in these enterprises, ensuring they operate within a reasoned and transparent framework.",
