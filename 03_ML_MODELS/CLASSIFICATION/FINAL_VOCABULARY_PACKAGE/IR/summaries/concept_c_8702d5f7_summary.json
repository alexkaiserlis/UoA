  "summary": "The concept of \"sustainable seafood,\" which redirects to \"sustainable fisheries,\" is pivotal in EU legal and regulatory frameworks aimed at ensuring the long-term viability of marine resources. Sustainable fisheries encompass practices that maintain fish populations and their habitats, thereby promoting ecological balance. The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) emphasizes sustainable management, aiming to prevent overfishing and protect marine biodiversity. By adhering to sustainability principles, the EU seeks to foster economic growth in coastal communities while safeguarding marine ecosystems. This regulatory approach aligns with broader environmental objectives, reinforcing the importance of sustainability in fisheries management across member states.",
