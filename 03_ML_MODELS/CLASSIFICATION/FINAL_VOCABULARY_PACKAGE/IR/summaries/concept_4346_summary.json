  "summary": "Over-production in the EU context refers to the situation where the quantity of goods produced, such as milk or sugar, exceeds the established quotas. This phenomenon can lead to excess supply, necessitating measures like withdrawal or temporary suspension of production to stabilize markets. The EU regulatory framework stipulates that producers must adapt their methods to avoid over-production, ensuring that they attain targets set by quotas. Compensation mechanisms may be offered to those affected by the discontinuation of production. The determination of quotas is crucial, as it guarantees a balanced market and prevents the crystallizing of excess quantities that could disrupt natural sales proportions.",
