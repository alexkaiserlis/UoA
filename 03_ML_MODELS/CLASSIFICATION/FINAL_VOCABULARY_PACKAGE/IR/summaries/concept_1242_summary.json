  "summary": "\"Question time\" refers to a specific segment within parliamentary proceedings in the European Union, where Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) engage in a structured dialogue with the European Commission and other officials. This practice allows MEPs to pose inquiries regarding legislative matters, policy implementation, and regulatory compliance, fostering transparency and accountability in governance. During question time, the exchange of information is crucial for scrutinizing the actions of the executive branch, thereby enhancing democratic oversight. This mechanism underscores the importance of parliamentary engagement in shaping EU legal frameworks and ensuring that regulatory measures align with the interests of EU citizens.",
