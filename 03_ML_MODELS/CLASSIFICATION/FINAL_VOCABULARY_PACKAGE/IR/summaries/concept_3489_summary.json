  "summary": "The \"cooperation policy\" within the EU framework embodies a programmatic approach aimed at fostering closeness among member states and enhancing collaboration across various sectors. This policy illustrates the importance of judiciaries and prosecutors working together, facilitating the relay of information and best practices. By promoting rapprochement among diverse civilisations, it seeks to address challenges faced by foreigners and NGOs, while also pinpointing areas for improvement. Initiatives like the Eucpn and TAIEX exemplify this flourishing cooperation, vital for tackling complex issues such as transnational crime and public health. Ultimately, the cooperation policy serves as a cornerstone for a united Europe, enhancing mutual understanding and shared objectives.",
