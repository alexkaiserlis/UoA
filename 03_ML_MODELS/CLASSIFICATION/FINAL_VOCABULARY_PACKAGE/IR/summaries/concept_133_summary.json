  "summary": "The \"conservation of fish stocks\" is a critical concept within EU fisheries regulation aimed at ensuring sustainable management of marine resources. This involves protecting various taxa, including elasmobranchii like the hammerhead and silky sharks, which are often overexploited. The EU's legal framework addresses issues such as finning and the predation of species like sandeels and cuttlefish. Regulatory measures are informed by assessments from organizations like the IUCN, which classify species based on their conservation status. The management of stocks, including anadromous species and sedentary populations, is essential for maintaining biodiversity in regions like the Øresund and Kattegat. The EU Council's sessions often discuss measures to prevent the depletion of stocks, ensuring that species such as the shortfin mako and skate are sustainably harvested.",
