  "summary": "Molecular biology, a pivotal domain within natural and applied sciences, encompasses the study of biological processes at the molecular level. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, it plays a crucial role in areas such as biotechnology regulation, genetic modification, and public health policies. The EU's regulatory landscape often necessitates rigorous assessments of molecular biology applications, particularly concerning safety and ethical considerations. This discipline informs directives and regulations that govern research and development, ensuring compliance with standards aimed at protecting human health and the environment. Understanding molecular biology is essential for effective policy-making and regulatory oversight within the EU.",
