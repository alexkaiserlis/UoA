  "summary": "The concept of \"legal deposit\" refers to the obligation imposed on publishers to submit copies of their publications to designated national libraries or archives. This regulatory framework is crucial for preserving cultural heritage and ensuring public access to published works. In the EU context, legal deposit laws vary by member state but generally aim to safeguard the integrity of the published record. By mandating the collection of diverse materials, legal deposit facilitates research, promotes literacy, and supports the documentation of societal developments. This practice underscores the importance of maintaining a comprehensive repository of knowledge within the EU's legal and cultural landscape.",
