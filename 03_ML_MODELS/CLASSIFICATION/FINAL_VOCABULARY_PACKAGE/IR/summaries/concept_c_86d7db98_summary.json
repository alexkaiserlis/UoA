  "summary": "The \"energy transition\" refers to the comprehensive shift in the European Union's energy policy aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing sustainability. This transition involves the adoption of renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and fostering technological innovation. Legal and regulatory frameworks, such as the European Green Deal and the Fit for 55 package, underpin this concept, establishing binding targets for member states. The energy transition is pivotal for achieving climate neutrality by 2050, necessitating coordinated efforts across sectors and compliance with EU directives. This strategic approach not only addresses environmental concerns but also promotes economic resilience and energy security within the EU.",
