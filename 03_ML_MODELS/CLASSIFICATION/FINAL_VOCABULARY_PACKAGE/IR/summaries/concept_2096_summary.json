  "summary": "A \"stateless person\" is an individual who is not considered a national by any state under the operation of its law. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, statelessness poses significant challenges, particularly concerning the rights and protections afforded to such individuals. The EU has established various directives and regulations to address the status of stateless persons, ensuring compliance with international law obligations, including the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons. These legal instruments aim to safeguard the fundamental rights of stateless individuals, facilitating their access to residency, social services, and protection against refoulement.",
