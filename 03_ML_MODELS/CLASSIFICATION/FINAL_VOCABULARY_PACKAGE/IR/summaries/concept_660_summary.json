  "summary": "The concept of \"regional economy\" pertains to the economic structure within specific geographic areas in the European Union. It encompasses the analysis of economic activities, resources, and development strategies that influence regional growth and sustainability. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the regional economy is critical for implementing cohesion policies aimed at reducing disparities among regions. This involves the allocation of funds and resources to promote economic integration and support local enterprises. Understanding the regional economy is essential for policymakers to foster innovation, enhance competitiveness, and ensure balanced development across the EU, thereby contributing to the overall economic stability of the Union.",
