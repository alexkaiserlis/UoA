  "summary": "The term \"bomber\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to military aircraft specifically designed for the purpose of delivering explosive ordnance. In the realm of defence, the regulation and classification of bombers are crucial for compliance with international treaties and EU directives concerning arms control and military engagement. The EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) encompasses measures that govern the deployment and use of bombers, ensuring adherence to principles of proportionality and necessity in military operations. Furthermore, discussions surrounding bombers often intersect with issues of security, non-proliferation, and the ethical implications of aerial warfare.",
