  "summary": "An \"international cartel\" refers to a collusive agreement between firms across different countries aimed at restricting competition and manipulating market conditions. Within the EU legal framework, such cartels violate Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which prohibits agreements that may affect trade between Member States and prevent, restrict, or distort competition. The European Commission actively investigates and penalizes international cartels to uphold market integrity and consumer welfare. Enforcement actions include substantial fines and leniency programs, encouraging whistleblowers to report anti-competitive practices, thereby fostering a competitive internal market.",
