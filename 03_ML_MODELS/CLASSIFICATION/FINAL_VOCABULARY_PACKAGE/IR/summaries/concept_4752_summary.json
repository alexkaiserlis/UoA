  "summary": "The term \"farmers' bank\" is a redirect to \"agricultural bank,\" which refers to financial institutions specifically tailored to support the agricultural sector. These banks provide repayable loans and credits to farmers, enabling them to attain necessary resources for their holdings. In the context of EU regulations, agricultural banks play a crucial role in the liberalisation of agricultural financing, distinguishing between various forms of subsidies and aids available to nationals. They facilitate the continuous support of agricultural practices, ensuring that farmers can enjoy benefits that include subsidised rates and tailored treatment. The establishment of such banks is essential for the attainment of sustainable agricultural development within the EU framework.",
