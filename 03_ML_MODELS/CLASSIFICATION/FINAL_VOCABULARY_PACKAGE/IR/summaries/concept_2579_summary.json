  "summary": "The concept of \"supervisory power\" within the EU legal framework refers to the authority granted to regulatory bodies to oversee compliance with established laws and regulations. This power is essential in managing complex sectors, such as maritime transport, where entities like navale and transmare operate. Supervisory powers enable the enforcement of standards, addressing difficulties faced by companies like cosenam and setramar in adhering to regional regulations. Additionally, supervisory bodies may intervene in cases of serious violations, including killings related to illegal activities. The effectiveness of these powers is crucial for maintaining order and ensuring that practices align with EU objectives, particularly in sectors like oceanographie and halieutiques.",
