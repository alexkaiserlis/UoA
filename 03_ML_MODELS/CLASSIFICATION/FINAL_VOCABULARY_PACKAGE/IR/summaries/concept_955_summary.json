  "summary": "The term \"extreme left\" refers to a political ideology and movement characterized by radical leftist principles, often advocating for significant systemic change, including socialism or communism. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, political parties identified as extreme left may influence legislative processes and policy-making. Their positions can challenge mainstream political discourse, particularly on issues such as social justice, economic redistribution, and civil rights. The EU recognizes diverse political expressions, including those from extreme left parties, as part of its commitment to democratic pluralism, thereby ensuring that various ideological perspectives are represented within its institutional framework.",
