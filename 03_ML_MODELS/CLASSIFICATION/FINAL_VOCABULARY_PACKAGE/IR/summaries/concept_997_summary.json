  "summary": "In EU fisheries regulation, the term \"trawl\" is redirected to \"fishing net,\" which encompasses various types of nets used to capture marine species such as cuttlefish and sandeels. Trawled nets, characterized by their specific meshes, are essential for targeting overexploited stocks like the longfinned pollack and codend species. Regulatory frameworks aim to prevent irremediable damage to marine ecosystems, including habitats like Lophelia pertusa mounds. The use of trawl nets must comply with guidelines established by bodies like the GFCM, ensuring sustainable practices. Additionally, the deployment of buoys and separators is crucial for effective fishing operations while minimizing bycatch of species like parapenaeus longirostris and aristeus antennatus.",
