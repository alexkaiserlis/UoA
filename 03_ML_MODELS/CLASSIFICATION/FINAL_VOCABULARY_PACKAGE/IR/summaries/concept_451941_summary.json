  "summary": "Guernsey, an island in the English Channel, is not a member of the European Union but is often referenced in EU legal and regulatory contexts due to its unique status as a British Crown Dependency. It operates under its own legal framework, which can impact EU regulations, particularly in areas such as taxation and financial services. The island has established various agreements with the EU to facilitate cooperation while maintaining its autonomy. As a result, Guernsey is relevant in discussions of regulatory compliance and international law, especially concerning issues like anti-money laundering and tax transparency, which align with EU objectives.",
