  "summary": "The \"resettlement of persons\" within the EU legal framework refers to the process of relocating individuals, particularly refugees and asylum seekers, from one country to another, often from regions experiencing conflict or humanitarian crises. This mechanism aims to provide durable solutions for those unable to return to their home countries. The EU has established various legal instruments and policies to facilitate resettlement, ensuring compliance with international obligations and promoting solidarity among member states. Resettlement is a critical component of the EU's broader migration strategy, addressing both humanitarian needs and the challenges of irregular migration while fostering integration in host countries.",
