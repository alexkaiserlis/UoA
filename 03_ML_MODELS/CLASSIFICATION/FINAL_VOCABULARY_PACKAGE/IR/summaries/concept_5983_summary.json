  "summary": "The concept of \"unemployment due to technical progress\" refers to job loss resulting from advancements in technology that enhance productivity but may render certain skills obsolete. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this phenomenon raises critical considerations for employment policies and social protection mechanisms. The EU institutions are tasked with addressing the implications of such unemployment through initiatives aimed at promoting reskilling and upskilling of the workforce. Furthermore, the EU's commitment to fostering innovation must be balanced with ensuring economic stability and protecting workers affected by technological transitions, thereby reinforcing the importance of adaptive labor market strategies.",
