  "summary": "The concept of \"Buddhist\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to the recognition and integration of diverse belief systems in social policy. While not explicitly addressed in EU legislation, the principles of Buddhism, emphasizing compassion and mindfulness, can influence discussions on social cohesion and cultural diversity. The EU promotes a social framework that respects various religions and philosophies, fostering an inclusive environment. This aligns with broader objectives of human rights and non-discrimination, ensuring that the values inherent in Buddhism contribute to the dialogue on social integration and community welfare across member states.",
