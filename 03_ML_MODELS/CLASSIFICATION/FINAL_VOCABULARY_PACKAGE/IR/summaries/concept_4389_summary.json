  "summary": "The \"self-supply rate,\" also referred to as the \"self-sufficiency rate,\" is a critical metric in EU trade regulations, particularly concerning agricultural and food security policies. This rate quantifies the proportion of a country's consumption that is met by its domestic production, thereby reflecting its capacity for self-sufficiency. In the context of EU legal frameworks, the self-sufficiency rate serves as an indicator for assessing the effectiveness of agricultural policies and trade agreements. By promoting higher self-sufficiency rates, the EU aims to enhance food security, reduce dependency on external markets, and support sustainable agricultural practices across member states.",
