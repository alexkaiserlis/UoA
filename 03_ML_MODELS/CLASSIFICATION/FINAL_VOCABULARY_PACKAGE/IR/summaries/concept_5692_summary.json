  "summary": "A \"constitutional court\" is a specialized judicial body within the legal system of a state, tasked with ensuring the supremacy of constitutional law. It adjudicates on matters concerning the interpretation and application of the constitution, safeguarding fundamental rights and principles. In the context of the European Union, constitutional courts play a crucial role in harmonizing national legal frameworks with EU law, addressing conflicts between domestic legislation and EU obligations. Their decisions can influence the legal landscape significantly, as they often set precedents that affect the organization of the legal system and the protection of citizens' rights across member states.",
