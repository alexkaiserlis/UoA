  "summary": "Mineralogy, a sub-discipline within natural and applied sciences, pertains to the study of minerals, their composition, structure, and properties. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, mineralogy is crucial for establishing standards related to resource extraction, environmental protection, and sustainable development. The European Union's regulations often address the implications of mineral extraction on ecosystems and human health, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of mineralogical characteristics. This knowledge informs policies on mining practices, waste management, and the promotion of circular economy principles, ensuring that mineral resources are utilized responsibly while minimizing adverse environmental impacts.",
