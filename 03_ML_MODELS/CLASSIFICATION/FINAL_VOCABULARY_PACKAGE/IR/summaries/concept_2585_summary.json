  "summary": "The concept of \"judicial power\" within the EU legal framework refers to the authority vested in courts and tribunals to interpret and apply the law, ensuring justice and the rule of law. Judicial power is fundamental to the functioning of the EU, as it safeguards the rights of individuals and upholds the principles enshrined in EU treaties. It encompasses various judicial bodies, including the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), which plays a crucial role in resolving disputes between member states and EU institutions. This power is essential for maintaining legal certainty and coherence across the EU's diverse legal systems.",
