  "summary": "The concept of \"political scandal,\" categorized under politics and public safety, is redirected to the preferred term \"political morality.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, political morality encompasses the ethical standards and principles governing the conduct of public officials. Political scandals often arise when these standards are breached, leading to public outcry and demands for accountability. Such incidents can undermine trust in institutions and necessitate regulatory responses, including reforms aimed at enhancing transparency and ethical governance. The interplay between political scandals and political morality is crucial for maintaining the integrity of democratic processes within the EU.",
