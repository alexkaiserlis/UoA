  "summary": "The European Social Charter is a pivotal instrument in the realm of social affairs within the European Union framework. Adopted in 1961 and revised in 1996, it aims to promote and safeguard fundamental social rights, including the right to work, health, education, and social protection. The Charter establishes a legal basis for monitoring compliance among member states, ensuring that social standards are upheld. It complements EU regulations by reinforcing the social dimension of the Union, thus fostering a cohesive and inclusive society. The Charter's enforcement mechanisms, including collective complaints, enhance its regulatory impact on social policy across Europe.",
