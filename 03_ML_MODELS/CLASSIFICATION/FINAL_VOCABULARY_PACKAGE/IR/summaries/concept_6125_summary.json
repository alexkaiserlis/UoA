  "summary": "The concept of \"internationalization of economic activity,\" often referred to as \"globalisation,\" encompasses the integration of markets and economies across borders, significantly influencing EU legal and regulatory frameworks. This phenomenon affects diverse sectors, including automotive (e.g., Opel, Renault, Peugeot) and textiles (e.g., apparel from regions like Podkarpackie and Aragón). Companies such as Alcoa and Delphi engage in cross-border operations, while ICT advancements facilitate this interconnectedness. The regulatory landscape addresses challenges posed by global supply chains, exemplified by firms like Fujikura and Unilever. Regions like Noord and Zuid in the Netherlands and communities in Spain, such as Cataluña, adapt to these dynamics, ensuring compliance with EU policies that promote sustainable economic growth.",
