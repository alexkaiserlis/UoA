  "summary": "The concept of \"national electoral law,\" redirected to the preferred term \"electoral law,\" encompasses the legal frameworks governing electoral procedures and voting within EU Member States. These laws regulate the conduct of elections, ensuring compliance with democratic principles and the protection of citizens' voting rights. National electoral law varies significantly across jurisdictions, reflecting diverse political cultures and historical contexts. In the EU regulatory landscape, harmonization efforts aim to establish common standards for electoral integrity and transparency, thereby enhancing the legitimacy of electoral processes. Understanding national electoral law is crucial for analyzing electoral systems and their alignment with EU values.",
