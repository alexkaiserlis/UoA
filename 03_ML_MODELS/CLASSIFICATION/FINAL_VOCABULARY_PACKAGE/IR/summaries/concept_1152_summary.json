  "summary": "Geophysics, a branch of natural and applied sciences, plays a critical role in the EU's regulatory framework concerning environmental protection and resource management. It encompasses the study of Earth's physical properties and processes, which is essential for assessing geological hazards, managing natural resources, and understanding climate change impacts. EU legislation often references geophysical data to inform policies related to land use, mineral extraction, and environmental sustainability. By integrating geophysical research into regulatory practices, the EU aims to promote informed decision-making that aligns with its environmental objectives and scientific advancements, ensuring a balanced approach to natural resource management and ecological preservation.",
