  "summary": "Parliamentary diplomacy refers to the diplomatic activities conducted by members of parliament (MPs) to foster international relations and dialogue. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, parliamentary diplomacy plays a crucial role in enhancing interparliamentary cooperation, promoting democratic values, and facilitating the exchange of best practices among EU member states and third countries. It serves as a mechanism for MPs to engage in discussions on global issues, thereby influencing foreign policy and legislative outcomes. This concept underscores the importance of legislative bodies in shaping international affairs and contributing to the EU's external action objectives.",
