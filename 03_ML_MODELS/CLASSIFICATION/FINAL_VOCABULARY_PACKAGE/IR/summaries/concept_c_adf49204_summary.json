This independent body collaborates with national prosecutors and law enforcement agencies, ensuring a coherent legal approach across member states. By centralizing prosecutorial functions, the EPPO aims to strengthen judicial cooperation and uphold the rule of law within the EU, thereby fostering a more integrated legal landscape.",
