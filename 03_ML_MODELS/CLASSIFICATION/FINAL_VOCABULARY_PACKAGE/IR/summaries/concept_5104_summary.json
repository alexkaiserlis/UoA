  "summary": "The \"fight against cancer\" is a critical concept within EU health regulations, primarily redirecting to the preferred term \"cancer.\" This encompasses a range of planned initiatives aimed at bolstering cancer therapy through advanced technologies such as radiotherapy and immunological treatments. Regulatory frameworks scrutinize the use of devices like electron accelerators and analyzers, ensuring that dosage and treatment protocols are formalised to mitigate risks associated with nitrosamines and other harmful agents. The EU emphasizes the importance of representative stakeholders in advising on best practices, while also addressing the need for redeployment of resources in response to emerging challenges in cancer care.",
