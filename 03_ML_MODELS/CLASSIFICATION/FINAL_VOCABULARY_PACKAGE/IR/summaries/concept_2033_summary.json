  "summary": "Nationalism, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the political ideology that emphasizes the interests and culture of a specific nation, often in opposition to supranational governance. This concept can influence legislative processes and policy-making, as member states may prioritize national sovereignty over collective EU objectives. Nationalism can manifest in various forms, such as economic protectionism or cultural preservation, potentially complicating the EU's aim for integration and unity. Understanding nationalism is crucial for navigating the complexities of EU law, particularly in areas like migration, trade, and regional autonomy, where national interests may conflict with EU regulations.",
