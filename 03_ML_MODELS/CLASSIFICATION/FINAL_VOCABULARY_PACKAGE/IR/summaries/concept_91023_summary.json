  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"financial incentive\" refers to mechanisms designed to encourage investment and promote the free movement of capital across member states. These incentives may take various forms, such as grants, tax reductions, or subsidies, aimed at stimulating economic activity and enhancing competitiveness within the internal market. The EU's commitment to the free movement of capital is fundamental, as it facilitates cross-border investments and fosters economic integration. By implementing financial incentives, the EU seeks to harmonize regulatory environments, thereby ensuring a level playing field for businesses and promoting sustainable growth across the region.",
