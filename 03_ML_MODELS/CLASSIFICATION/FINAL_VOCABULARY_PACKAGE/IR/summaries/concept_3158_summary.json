  "summary": "Erosion, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the deterioration of the environment, specifically the degradation of land and soil quality. This phenomenon poses significant challenges to biodiversity, agricultural productivity, and ecosystem stability. The EU has implemented various directives and regulations aimed at mitigating the impacts of erosion, promoting sustainable land management practices, and enhancing soil protection. These measures are critical for achieving the EU's environmental objectives, including the European Green Deal, which seeks to combat climate change and protect natural resources. Effective management of erosion is essential for ensuring long-term ecological balance and environmental sustainability.",
