  "summary": "Supply chain management, often redirected to the preferred term \"supply chain,\" encompasses the strategic oversight of the flow of goods, services, and information from origin to consumer. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, effective supply chain management is crucial for compliance with various directives, including those related to trade, environmental sustainability, and consumer protection. The EU emphasizes transparency and accountability within supply chains to mitigate risks associated with human rights violations and environmental harm. By establishing robust supply chain protocols, businesses can enhance operational efficiency while adhering to regulatory standards, thereby fostering a sustainable economic environment.",
