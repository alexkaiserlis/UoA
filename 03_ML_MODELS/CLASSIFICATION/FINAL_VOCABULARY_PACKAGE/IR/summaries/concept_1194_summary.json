  "summary": "The \"Group of Ten\" refers to an informal coalition of ten major industrialized nations, primarily established to facilitate dialogue on international monetary cooperation and economic policy. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the Group plays a crucial role in addressing global financial stability and coordinating responses to economic challenges. Although not a formal institution, its influence extends to shaping policies that impact the EU's economic governance. The Group's discussions often inform EU regulatory measures, particularly in areas concerning fiscal policy, exchange rates, and international trade, thereby contributing to the broader objectives of economic integration and stability within the EU.",
