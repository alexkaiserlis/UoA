  "summary": "The concept of \"fiscal monopoly\" refers to a situation where a single entity, typically the state, holds exclusive rights to levy taxes or provide certain financial services. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, fiscal monopolies can arise in various sectors, such as gambling or tobacco, where member states establish exclusive rights to regulate and collect revenues. This can raise issues related to competition law and the internal market, as such monopolies may restrict market access for private operators. The EU seeks to balance the need for fiscal control with the principles of free competition and consumer protection, ensuring compliance with overarching regulatory standards.",
