  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the concept of \"foodstuff with a flavouring effect,\" redirected to the preferred term \"flavouring,\" encompasses a variety of substances that impart taste and aroma to food products. These flavourings can include complex compounds such as dialcohols, diketones, and hydroxyketones, which may exhibit properties like excitability and irritability in hypersensitive individuals. The regulation of flavourings also considers the use of natural extracts, such as cayenne and chillies, alongside synthetic agents like methoxybenzene and dimethoxybenzene. The EU framework mandates that flavourings must not pose prohibitive health risks, ensuring that any emulsifiers or condensates used are safe and compliant with established standards.",
