  "summary": "Secular education refers to an educational framework that is free from religious influence, promoting a curriculum based on rational and scientific principles. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, secular education is essential for ensuring the right to education as enshrined in various treaties and charters, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This concept supports the development of critical thinking and inclusivity, allowing diverse beliefs to coexist within the educational system. The EU encourages member states to uphold secular education standards, fostering an environment where students can engage in learning devoid of religious bias, thereby reinforcing democratic values.",
