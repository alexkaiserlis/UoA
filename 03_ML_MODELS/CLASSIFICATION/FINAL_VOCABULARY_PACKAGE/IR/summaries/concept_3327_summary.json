  "summary": "The concept of \"distribution by age\" pertains to the demographic analysis of populations within the European Union, focusing on the age structure and its implications for policy-making. This analysis is crucial for understanding demographic trends, which can influence various regulatory frameworks, including social security, healthcare, and labor market policies. By examining the distribution of age groups, EU institutions can better address the needs of different segments of the population, ensuring that legislative measures are equitable and effective. This concept is vital for demographic studies and informs strategic planning in areas such as public health and economic development across member states.",
