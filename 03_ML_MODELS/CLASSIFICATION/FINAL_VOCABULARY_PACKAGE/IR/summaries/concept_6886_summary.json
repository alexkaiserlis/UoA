  "summary": "A \"nationalist party\" refers to a political party that advocates for the interests and identity of a specific nation, often emphasizing sovereignty, cultural heritage, and self-determination. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, nationalist parties may influence policy-making, particularly in areas such as immigration, trade, and regional autonomy. Their emergence can challenge the principles of European integration and collective governance. The activities and electoral success of nationalist parties are monitored under EU regulations concerning political pluralism and democratic participation, reflecting the balance between national interests and EU cohesion.",
