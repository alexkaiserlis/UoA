  "summary": "The concept of \"historic site\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to locations designated for their cultural and heritage significance. The European Union, through various treaties and decisions, establishes criteria for selecting and designating such sites, ensuring they are monitored and respected. The process involves a panel that reviews applications, taking into account recommendations and reports submitted by member states. Regular evaluations are conducted to ensure these sites meet the established standards. The designation of a historic site not only awards a prestigious label but also transmits a commitment to preserving cultural heritage in accordance with EU values and objectives.",
