  "summary": "The \"environment-friendly label,\" commonly referred to as \"eco-label,\" is a regulatory concept within EU marketing frameworks aimed at promoting sustainability. Eco-labels serve as indicators of products that meet specific environmental criteria, enhancing consumer awareness. For instance, eco-labels may apply to various items, including dishwashers, cleaners, and laundry detergents, which utilize biodegradable surfactants and degradable substrates. The EU's ecolabelling initiatives also encompass sectors such as stationery and textiles, ensuring that products like shirts and linens adhere to environmental standards. NGOs play a crucial role in this process, advocating for transparency and compliance, while visitors to eco-labeled campsites can enjoy eco-friendly amenities.",
