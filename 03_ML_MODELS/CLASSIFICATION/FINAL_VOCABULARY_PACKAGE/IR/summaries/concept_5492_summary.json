  "summary": "The concept of \"unfair terms of contract\" within EU civil law addresses the unfairness that may arise in contractual agreements, particularly between sellers and acquirers. Courts are tasked with evaluating whether terms are intelligible and fairly drafted, ensuring that citizens are not deprived of their rights. The regulation aims to circumscribe the strength of unfair clauses that could bind parties inequitably, thus safeguarding fairness in commercial dealings. Complaints regarding such terms are presumed to arise from imbalances in bargaining power, and the law seeks to avert situations where one party, often the insurer or seller, unfairly prevails over the other. Solidarity among professions is essential in promoting equitable contracts that stimulate fair trade practices.",
