  "summary": "The concept of \"used goods\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to items that have been previously owned and are being resold or repurposed. This category is significant in discussions surrounding consumption patterns, sustainability, and circular economy initiatives. The EU encourages the trade of used goods to minimize waste and promote resource efficiency, aligning with environmental regulations and consumer protection laws. Regulatory measures may include labeling requirements, quality standards, and safety assessments to ensure that used goods meet specific criteria before being placed on the market. This concept is integral to fostering responsible consumption and supporting the EU's broader sustainability goals.",
