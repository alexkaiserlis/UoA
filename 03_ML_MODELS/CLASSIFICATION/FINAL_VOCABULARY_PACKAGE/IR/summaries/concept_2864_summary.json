  "summary": "The \"publication of accounts\" is a critical regulatory concept within EU accounting frameworks, particularly under IFRS standards. It presupposes the obligation for entities, including conglomerates and branches, to publish financial statements that adhere to stringent auditing requirements. This process is vital for boosting investor confidence and ensuring systemic transparency in financial markets. By illustrating the valuation of assets and liabilities, including debentures and convertible tokens, it aids creditors in assessing the adequacy of collateral. The burdensome nature of compliance is often relieved through streamlined processes, fostering a serene environment for stakeholders, including Monegasque entities and Croatian investors, to engage in productive economic activities.",
