  "summary": "The \"intervention price\" is a critical regulatory measure within the EU agricultural market framework, designed to stabilize prices and ensure availability of essential commodities. Whereas that intervention prices are set to prevent excessive decrement in market values, they serve to support farmers by providing a safety net against oversupply and price fluctuations. This measure is particularly pertinent during bumper harvests, where the risk of unripe produce leads to market instability. Organizations involved in agricultural production must comply with these regulations, which are publicised to ensure transparency. The intervention price, therefore, exerts a significant influence on market dynamics, impacting the competitiveness of various agricultural products, including semolina and sugarcane. By rebalancing market tendencies, it helps maintain a fair trading environment, fostering a sustainable agricultural sector.",
