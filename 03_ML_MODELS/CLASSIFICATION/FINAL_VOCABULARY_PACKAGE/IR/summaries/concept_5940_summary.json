  "summary": "\"Non-standard work,\" redirected to \"non-standard employment,\" refers to employment arrangements that deviate from traditional full-time, permanent contracts. Within the EU legal framework, this concept encompasses various forms of work, including part-time, temporary, and freelance positions. Such employment types often lack the same protections and benefits afforded to standard employment, raising concerns about job security, social rights, and working conditions. The EU has recognized the need to address these disparities through regulatory measures aimed at ensuring fair treatment and adequate protections for all workers, thereby promoting equitable labor standards across member states.",
