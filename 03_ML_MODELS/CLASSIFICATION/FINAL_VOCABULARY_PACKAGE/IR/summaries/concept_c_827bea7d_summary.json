  "summary": "The concept of \"social memory,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"collective memory,\" pertains to the shared understanding and recollection of historical events within a society. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, collective memory plays a crucial role in shaping cultural policies, promoting social cohesion, and fostering a sense of identity among member states. It influences legislation related to cultural heritage, education, and the preservation of historical narratives. By recognizing the importance of collective memory, the EU aims to enhance intercultural dialogue and ensure that diverse cultural expressions are respected and integrated into the broader European identity.",
