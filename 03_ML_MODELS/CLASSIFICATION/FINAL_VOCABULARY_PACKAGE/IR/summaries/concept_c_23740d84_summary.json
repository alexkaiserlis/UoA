  "summary": "The concept of \"food web,\" categorized under natural and applied sciences, is a redirect to the preferred term \"food chain.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the food chain is integral to understanding ecological interactions and biodiversity management. Regulations concerning food safety, environmental protection, and sustainable agriculture often reference the food chain to assess the impacts of pollutants and invasive species on ecosystems. By analyzing the interdependencies within the food chain, EU policies aim to promote sustainable practices that safeguard both human health and environmental integrity, ensuring a balanced approach to resource management and conservation efforts.",
