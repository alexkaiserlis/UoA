  "summary": "Sexual discrimination, as recognized within EU legal frameworks, encompasses practices that deprive individuals of equal opportunities based on sex, race, or beliefs. The concept is pivotal in enforcing equality, particularly in vocational settings, where women and men may face intensified disparities in remuneration and career advancement. Courts often investigate claims brought by plaintiffs, including those related to pregnancy and parental leave, to ensure fair treatment. The Amsterdam Treaty and directives from the ETUC emphasize the importance of conciliation and mediation in resolving disputes. Prima facie evidence of discrimination may shift the burden of proof to the respondent, thus fostering an environment of appreciation for diversity and inclusion.",
