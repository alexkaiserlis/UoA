The EU's Biodiversity Strategy emphasizes the protection of amphibian habitats, addressing threats such as habitat loss and pollution. Regulations, such as the Habitats Directive, aim to conserve various amphibian species, ensuring their survival and the maintenance of biodiversity. Understanding the legal implications surrounding amphibians is crucial for effective environmental governance and compliance with EU environmental policies.",
