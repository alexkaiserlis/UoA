  "summary": "An \"invalid ballot paper\" refers to a voting document that does not meet the legal requirements set forth in electoral procedures within the EU. Such ballots may arise from errors in completion, lack of proper authentication, or failure to adhere to prescribed formats. The classification of a ballot as invalid is crucial, as it directly impacts the integrity of the electoral process and the legitimacy of the results. EU regulations mandate clear guidelines to ensure that all ballots are valid, thereby safeguarding democratic principles and enhancing voter confidence in electoral outcomes. Understanding this concept is essential for compliance with electoral law.",
