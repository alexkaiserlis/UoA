  "summary": "Teleprocessing, redirected to the preferred term \"telematics,\" encompasses the integration of teleinformatics and automation in information technology and data processing within the EU regulatory framework. This concept is crucial for enhancing accessibility and efficiency in decentralized systems, such as those involving consignors and consignees. Regulatory documents often outline deliverables and timelines (timescale) for implementing telematic solutions, which include platforms for electronic data interchange (EDI) and subsystems for managing rolling stock, like wagons. The architecture of these systems aims to mitigate outdated practices and ensure compliance with norms, addressing the needs of disabled users and promoting interoperability across various stakeholders.",
