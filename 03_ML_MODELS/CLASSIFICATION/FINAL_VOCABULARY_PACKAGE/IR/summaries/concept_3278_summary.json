  "summary": "The concept of \"teaching materials\" pertains to the organization of teaching within the EU framework, encompassing publications, books, and other educational resources. These materials are intended to facilitate learning and are often aligned with UNESCO recommendations and initiatives. The aim is to ensure that teaching resources are compliant with cultural and scientific standards, thereby affording educators the tools necessary to enhance educational outcomes. Although some materials may be excluded from certain customs provisions, the importation of teaching materials is generally encouraged to extend educational possibilities. This concept is integral to various EU agreements and protocols, constituting a vital instrument for educational development.",
