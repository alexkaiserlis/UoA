  "summary": "The concept of \"sharia,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"Islamic law,\" encompasses a comprehensive legal framework derived from the Quran and Hadith, guiding various aspects of life for Muslims. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, Islamic law may intersect with issues of religious freedom, cultural rights, and the integration of diverse legal systems within member states. While EU law primarily governs secular legal principles, understanding Islamic law is crucial for addressing the rights of Muslim communities, particularly in matters of personal status, family law, and dispute resolution. This relationship highlights the need for sensitivity and inclusivity in legal discourse.",
