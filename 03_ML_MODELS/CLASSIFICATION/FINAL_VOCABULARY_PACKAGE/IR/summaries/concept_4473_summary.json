  "summary": "In the context of European Union law, a \"compulsory opinion,\" also referred to as \"EP opinion,\" is a formal assessment mandated by the European Parliament (EP) on specific legislative proposals or policy matters. This opinion is essential for ensuring that the EP's perspective is considered in the decision-making process, particularly regarding legislative initiatives that impact EU citizens and member states. The compulsory nature of this opinion underscores its significance in the regulatory framework, as it provides a necessary check on the legislative process, fostering democratic accountability and transparency within EU governance.",
