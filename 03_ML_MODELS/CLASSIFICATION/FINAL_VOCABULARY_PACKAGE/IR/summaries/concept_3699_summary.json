  "summary": "\"Constitutional revision\" refers to the formal process by which a state amends its constitution, a fundamental legal framework governing its institutions and laws. In the context of the European Union, constitutional revision is significant as it may affect member states' compliance with EU law and principles. The process typically involves legislative procedures, public referenda, or both, ensuring democratic legitimacy. Such revisions can address various aspects, including the distribution of powers, fundamental rights, and institutional reforms. The implications of constitutional revision extend to the coherence of EU legal order, influencing how member states align their national laws with EU regulations and directives.",
