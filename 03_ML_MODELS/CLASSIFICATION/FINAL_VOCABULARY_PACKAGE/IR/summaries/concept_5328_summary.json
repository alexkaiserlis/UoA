  "summary": "The General Court (EU) serves as a crucial tribunal within the EU legal framework, contemplating various disputes involving EU institutions and civil servants. It is tasked with hearing cases that encompass a wide range of jurisdictions, including litigation related to the legality of acts by EU bodies. Judges, appointed to the bench, exercise their roles with unequivocal commitment, ensuring that candidates for positions within the court are assessed for suitability. The court's workload includes redrafting decisions and managing appeals, while also conferring privileges and immunities to its members. Advocates and lawyers play a vital role in assisting the court, which has regained its prominence in the EU legal landscape.",
