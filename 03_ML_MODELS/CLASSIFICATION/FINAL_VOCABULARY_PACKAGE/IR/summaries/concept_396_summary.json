  "summary": "\"Consumption expenditure\" refers to the total amount of money spent by households and non-profit institutions on goods and services within the European Union. This concept is pivotal in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly in economic analyses and policy-making. It encompasses various categories, including durable and non-durable goods, as well as services, reflecting consumer behavior and economic health. Understanding consumption expenditure is essential for the formulation of fiscal policies, monitoring inflation, and assessing the overall economic performance of member states. Accurate measurement and reporting of this expenditure are crucial for effective governance and compliance with EU regulations.",
