  "summary": "Fishing statistics are critical for the sustainable management of fisheries within the EU, providing essential data on catches, landings, and the biological status of species such as cod, herring, and tuna. These statistics facilitate the compilation of comprehensive censuses that inform regulatory frameworks, ensuring the impartiality of assessments regarding endangered species like elasmobranchs, including sharks and rays. The data collection processes often involve questionnaires and synchronised approaches across member states, contributing to a unified understanding of fisheries economics and ecosystem health. Historic data, such as that from NAFO and NASCO, alongside the latest statistics, help in the formulation of effective management strategies for artisanal and industrial fishing gears.",
