  "summary": "The concept of \"change of political system\" encompasses significant transformations within a state's governance structure, often inaugurated through constitutional amendments or new electoral processes. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such changes are critical milestones that require credible mediation and inclusive dialogue among stakeholders. For instance, the Cotonou Agreement outlines procedures for member states, including Burkina Faso and Madagascar, to ensure transparent elections and the appointment of newly elected ministers. The EU welcomes these developments, confirming its support for a roadmap that fulfills democratic principles while addressing violations. Such changes are pivotal for fostering consensus in regions like the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Caribbean, enhancing stability and governance.",
