  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"streaming\" is often redirected to the preferred term \"broadcasting.\" This encompasses various forms of media, including periodicals, newspapers, and magazines, which are intrinsically linked to the distribution of copyrighted content. The World Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) restate the rights of auteurs, compositeurs, and lyricists, ensuring their works are protected during retransmission. Regulatory bodies, such as IMRO and GESAC, lobby for fair practices, while the digital broadcasting landscape, including DVB and backhaul technologies, has curtails on addictive content. This evolving framework seeks to balance the interests of creators and consumers, fostering a vibrant media environment.",
