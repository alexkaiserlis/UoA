  "summary": "The \"military space race,\" redirected to the preferred term \"militarisation of space,\" refers to the increasing involvement of military interests in outer space activities, which raises significant international security concerns. Within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is critical as it intersects with treaties governing the peaceful use of outer space, such as the Outer Space Treaty. The EU actively engages in discussions to mitigate risks associated with the militarisation of space, promoting cooperative security measures and compliance with international law. This regulatory approach aims to ensure that space remains a domain for peaceful exploration rather than a battleground for military competition.",
