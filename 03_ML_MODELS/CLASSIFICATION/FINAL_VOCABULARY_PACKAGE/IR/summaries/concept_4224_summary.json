  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, a \"by-product\" refers to materials derived from industrial processes that are not the primary product but can be utilized, such as tallow or fishmeal. By-products can be subjected to processes like composting, fermentation, or hydrolysis to create valuable resources, including biodiesel or biogas. Regulations demarcate the handling of by-products to prevent ecotoxicity and ensure safety, particularly concerning pathogens in animal by-products like manure or sludge. Proper management practices, including stockpiling and incineration, are essential to conserve habitat and mitigate unintended consequences. By-products may also serve as fertilisers or feed for ruminants, enhancing pastureland productivity.",
