  "summary": "The \"Tokyo Round\" refers to a significant series of multilateral trade negotiations that took place under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) from 1973 to 1979. This round aimed to reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers, thereby promoting international trade liberalization. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the outcomes of the Tokyo Round have influenced the formulation of tariff policies and trade agreements within the EU. The negotiations established precedents for future trade discussions, including the Uruguay Round, and contributed to the evolution of the EU's external trade relations and its commitment to a rules-based trading system.",
