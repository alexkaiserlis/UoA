  "summary": "The concept of \"forum\" within EU legal and regulatory documents serves as a critical platform for discussing strategic governance and enhancing cooperation among member states. It facilitates the elaboration of policies related to civilian and military missions, such as EUBAM and EUCAP, particularly in regions like Libya and Africa. The forum is integral in modernising defence modalities and addressing failures in existing frameworks. By endorsing transparent dialogue among stakeholders, it promotes convergence in corporate governance and strategic direction. The implications of these discussions are vital for enhancing the EU’s role in international affairs, as evidenced by missions like EUFOR and the reflections from the Göteborg and Nice summits.",
