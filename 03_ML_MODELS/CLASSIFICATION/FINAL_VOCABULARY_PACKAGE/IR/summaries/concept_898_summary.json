  "summary": "The concept of \"foreign student\" pertains to individuals who pursue education in a country other than their own, often within the context of EU member states. This category includes pupils and residents from third countries who seek to integrate into the educational systems of EU territories. The legal framework regarding foreign students is shaped by policies that facilitate their entry and movement across member states, ensuring improved access to educational facilities. Initiatives adopted by the EU aim to enhance the determination of conditions for granting residency and educational rights, thereby fostering a common interest in educational cooperation among communities within the Union.",
