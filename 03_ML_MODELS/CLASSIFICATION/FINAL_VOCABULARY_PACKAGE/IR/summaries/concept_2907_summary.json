  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"enumeration\" is synonymous with \"census,\" serving as a methodological framework for gathering and compiling data. This process fosters objectivity and impartiality, ensuring that the information is independently verified and rationalized. Censuses, as conducted by Eurostat, involve the systematic transcription and dissemination of metadata, enhancing accountability and integrity in data reporting. The methodologies employed include logical formulae for measuring various segments, such as housing and fleet tonnage. By overseeing these processes, the EU ensures that the data gathered is confidential, accurate, and relevant, thereby supporting informed decision-making and rationalization of policies.",
