  "summary": "The \"right of custody of children,\" commonly referred to as \"custody,\" pertains to the legal authority and responsibility for the care and upbringing of a child. In the context of EU law, custody arrangements are governed by various regulations, including the Brussels II bis Regulation, which facilitates cross-border custody disputes. This concept encompasses both physical custody, which relates to where a child lives, and legal custody, which involves decision-making rights regarding the child's welfare. The EU emphasizes the child's best interests in custody matters, ensuring that parental rights are balanced with the child's needs, thus promoting stability and security in familial relationships.",
