  "summary": "Proportional representation is a fundamental electoral principle employed within the European Union's electoral procedures, ensuring that political parties receive seats in legislative bodies in proportion to the number of votes they secure. This method contrasts with winner-takes-all systems, promoting inclusivity and reflecting diverse political views. It is particularly significant in the context of the European Parliament elections, where various member states implement different proportional representation systems, such as the D'Hondt method or the Sainte-LaguÃ« method. By facilitating a more equitable representation of voters' preferences, proportional representation enhances democratic legitimacy and fosters political pluralism across the EU.",
