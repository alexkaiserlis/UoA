  "summary": "The concept of \"sport fishing,\" redirected to the preferred term \"recreational fishing,\" pertains to activities involving the catching of fish for leisure rather than for commercial purposes. Within the EU legal and regulatory framework, recreational fishing is subject to various directives aimed at sustainable resource management and conservation of aquatic ecosystems. Regulations may include licensing requirements, seasonal restrictions, and catch limits to ensure the preservation of fish populations and habitats. The EU emphasizes the importance of balancing recreational fishing activities with environmental protection, reflecting broader social affairs objectives related to biodiversity and sustainable development.",
