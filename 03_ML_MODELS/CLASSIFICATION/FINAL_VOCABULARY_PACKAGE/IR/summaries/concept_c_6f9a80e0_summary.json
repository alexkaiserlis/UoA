It encourages regions to identify and focus on their unique strengths and competitive advantages, thereby fostering a more efficient allocation of resources. This concept is pivotal in the context of EU regional policy, as it aligns with the objectives of the European Structural and Investment Funds. By promoting tailored research and innovation strategies, smart specialisation aims to stimulate sustainable economic growth, enhance regional cohesion, and facilitate collaboration among stakeholders, including businesses, academia, and public authorities, ultimately contributing to a more competitive European economy.",
