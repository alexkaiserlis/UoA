  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, a \"natural person\" refers to an individual human being, as opposed to a legal entity such as a corporation. This concept is fundamental in civil law, influencing various legal frameworks, including those addressing issues of illegitimate actions and human rights violations. For instance, in cases involving figures like Radovan Karadžić or Ratko Mladić, the accountability of natural persons for atrocities, including brutality and forcible displacement, is scrutinized. Legal documents may also address the prohibition of actions by natural persons that supersede established laws, ensuring that individuals like Goran and Vujadin are held accountable for their actions, thus reinforcing the rule of law in the EU.",
