  "summary": "The concept of \"obstacle to development\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to factors that hinder economic growth and sustainable progress in member states. Such obstacles can manifest in various forms, including regulatory burdens, inadequate infrastructure, or restrictive market conditions. The EU aims to identify and mitigate these barriers through policies that promote economic cohesion and enhance competitiveness. Addressing obstacles to development is crucial for achieving the objectives outlined in the Europe 2020 strategy, which emphasizes smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth. By removing these impediments, the EU seeks to foster an environment conducive to innovation and economic resilience.",
