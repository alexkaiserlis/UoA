  "summary": "A \"fishing port\" is a designated area where fishing vessels, such as trawlers and netters, berth to facilitate the landing of catches, including species like hake and herring. In the context of EU fisheries regulation, these ports play a vital role in the sectorial management of marine resources, ensuring compliance with spatial planning and environmental policies. They serve as hubs for decommissioning activities and the maintenance of logbooks by masters of vessels. The integration of electronically monitored gear and mesh regulations aims to avoid overfishing of juveniles and promote sustainable practices. Key ports, including those in the Cantabrian and Nordic regions, support local economies and contribute to the overall fishing fleet's lifetime viability.",
