  "summary": "The term \"migrant worker\" refers to foreigners who move to another country for employment, often dictated by demographic needs within the labour market. In the EU context, legal frameworks safeguard their rights, ensuring access to education, healthcare, and maternity benefits. Various communiqués and propositions have aimed to widen the privileges of migrant workers, facilitating their integration and reception into host countries. This includes modules for teaching their native tongue and initialling agreements that support family reunification. Migrant workers, along with their descendants, contribute significantly to filling vacant positions in the workforce, thereby enhancing economic growth and social cohesion across member states.",
