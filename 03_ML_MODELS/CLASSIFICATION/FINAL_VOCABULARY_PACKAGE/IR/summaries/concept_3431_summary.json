  "summary": "The concept of \"space-based weapons\" pertains to military capabilities deployed in outer space, which raise significant legal and regulatory concerns within the EU framework. The European Union emphasizes the necessity of adhering to international treaties, such as the Outer Space Treaty, which prohibits the placement of nuclear weapons in space and limits the militarization of celestial bodies. The EU's regulatory approach aims to foster a peaceful use of outer space while addressing security challenges posed by potential space-based weaponry. This includes promoting disarmament and ensuring compliance with international law to prevent an arms race in outer space, thereby safeguarding global security.",
