  "summary": "Organic certification within the EU framework refers to the regulatory process that verifies agricultural products comply with organic farming standards. Governed by Regulation (EU) 2018/848, this certification ensures that products are produced without synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or genetically modified organisms. The certification process involves rigorous inspections and adherence to specific practices that promote environmental sustainability and biodiversity. It is critical for marketing organic products, as it assures consumers of their authenticity and quality. Furthermore, organic certification plays a vital role in the EU's broader agricultural policy, supporting the transition towards sustainable food systems and enhancing consumer trust in organic labels.",
