  "summary": "The \"second Lomé Convention\" is a pivotal agreement within EU legal frameworks, particularly concerning relations with African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) states. Signed in 1989, it aimed at fostering independence and development through trade and cooperation. The convention included provisions for tariff reductions and derogations, thereby enhancing market access for ACP products, such as tufted carpets from Jamaica and Brunei. It established a framework for association, adapting to the needs of territories that acceded to the EU. The annexes outlined specific customs processes and lists of eligible goods, resulting in a more open trade environment, which has been crucial for achieving economic stability in these regions.",
