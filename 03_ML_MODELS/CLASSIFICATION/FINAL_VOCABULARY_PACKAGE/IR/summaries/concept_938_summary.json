  "summary": "The term \"sovkhoz,\" which translates to \"State farm,\" refers to a specific farming system characterized by state ownership and management of agricultural production. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the concept of state farms is significant for understanding agricultural policies and the historical evolution of farming systems within member states. Although \"sovkhoz\" is a redirect to \"State farm,\" it highlights the implications of state intervention in agriculture, particularly in relation to EU regulations on market competition and agricultural subsidies. This understanding is crucial for analyzing the impact of state farms on the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and rural development strategies.",
