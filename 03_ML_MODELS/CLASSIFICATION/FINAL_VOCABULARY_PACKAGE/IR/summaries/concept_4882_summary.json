  "summary": "In EU legal terminology, the concept of \"defendant\" refers to an individual or entity accused of a crime or facing legal action in a court of law. This term is often redirected to \"charge,\" which signifies the formal accusation made against the defendant. The defendant's rights are protected under various EU regulations, ensuring fair trial standards and due process. The role of the defendant is crucial in the justice system, as they have the opportunity to contest the charges and present a defense. Understanding this relationship between \"defendant\" and \"charge\" is essential for interpreting legal proceedings within the EU framework.",
