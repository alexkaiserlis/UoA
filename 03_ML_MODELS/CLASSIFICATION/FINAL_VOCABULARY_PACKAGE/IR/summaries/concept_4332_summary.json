  "summary": "The concept of \"withdrawal of employment,\" commonly equated with \"job cuts,\" pertains to the legal and regulatory framework governing redundancies within the EU. This term emanates from complex employer-employee relationships, particularly in cases of bankruptcies or significant organizational restructuring. EU directives stipulating the rights of workers during such terminations promote a balanced approach to employment security. Employers are required to inform affected workers and adhere to deadlines for redundancy notifications. The judicial consequences of non-compliance can include collective actions by workers, necessitating a careful transposition of EU law into national frameworks. Experts advocate for rationality in managing redundancies to alleviate the impact on living standards.",
