  "summary": "Petrology, a sub-discipline within natural and applied sciences, focuses on the study of rocks and the processes that form them. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, petrology is significant for its implications in environmental assessments, resource management, and geological hazard mitigation. Understanding the composition and structure of geological materials is essential for compliance with regulations concerning natural resources, land use, and environmental protection. The EU's commitment to sustainable development necessitates the integration of petrological insights into policy-making, ensuring that geological considerations inform decisions related to mineral extraction, waste management, and ecosystem preservation.",
