  "summary": "\"Social dumping\" refers to the practice where companies exploit lower labor standards or wages in one EU member state to gain a competitive advantage over businesses in countries with higher social protections. This phenomenon raises significant concerns regarding fair competition and the protection of workers' rights within the internal market. The EU legal framework aims to address social dumping through various regulations and directives that promote social cohesion and equitable labor conditions across member states. By fostering a level playing field, the EU seeks to prevent the erosion of labor standards and ensure that economic growth does not come at the expense of social welfare.",
