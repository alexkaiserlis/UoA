  "summary": "The \"regulation of investments\" within the EU legal framework encompasses various mechanisms to ensure that financial institutions, such as jugobanka and inlit, operate transparently and responsibly. This regulatory landscape includes provisions for managing liquidated assets and addressing the complexities of cross-border investments, particularly in regions like Belgrade and Kraljevo. Institutions like the Landeszentralbank and Banque de France play pivotal roles in overseeing compliance. Moreover, the regulation addresses socially responsible investment practices, ensuring that managers and administrators adhere to ethical standards. By fostering a stable investment environment, the EU aims to boost economic growth while safeguarding against risks associated with entities like Jugometal and Yusico.",
