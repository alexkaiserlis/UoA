  "summary": "The concept of \"regional language\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to languages that are spoken in specific geographic areas, often alongside national languages. The recognition of regional languages is crucial for promoting cultural diversity and ensuring the protection of linguistic heritage. EU legislation, such as the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, aims to safeguard these languages, fostering their use in education, media, and public life. This regulatory approach not only supports the rights of linguistic minorities but also enhances social cohesion and regional identity, reflecting the EU's commitment to cultural pluralism and multilingualism.",
