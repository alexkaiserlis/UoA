  "summary": "Market protection within the EU trade policy framework refers to measures that assert defensive strategies to shield domestic industries from external competition. This concept is particularly relevant for sectors like tanneries and the importation of goods such as dyed shoes and vegetables. The implementation of market protection can initiate criticism from trade partners, especially when it appears protectionist. In the context of agreements like the Marrakech Round, the EU focuses on ensuring that requisite standards are fulfilled while managing operations that may unpredictably slide in profitability. The regulatory landscape is tightened to certify compliance, thereby fostering a more stable market environment for local producers.",
