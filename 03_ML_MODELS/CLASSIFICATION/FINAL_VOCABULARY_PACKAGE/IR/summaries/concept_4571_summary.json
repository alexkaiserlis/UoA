  "summary": "Triticale, classified under the category of plant products (6006), is a hybrid cereal grain resulting from the crossbreeding of wheat (Triticum) and rye (Secale). In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, triticale is significant for its agricultural applications and potential contributions to food security. The EU regulates the cultivation, trade, and use of triticale through various directives aimed at ensuring quality, safety, and sustainability in plant production. As a relatively rare crop, triticale's inclusion in EU agricultural policies reflects a commitment to diversifying crop production and enhancing resilience against climate change impacts on food systems.",
