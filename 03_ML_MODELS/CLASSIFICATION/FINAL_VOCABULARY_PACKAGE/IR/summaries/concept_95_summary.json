  "summary": "The concept of \"conflict of powers\" pertains to the distribution and exercise of authority among various institutions within the European Union. It highlights the potential for disputes arising when different entities, such as the European Parliament, the Council, and the Commission, assert overlapping or competing competencies. This conflict can lead to regulatory ambiguities and challenges in governance, necessitating clear legal frameworks to delineate responsibilities. The resolution of such conflicts is crucial for maintaining the integrity of EU law and ensuring effective public safety and political stability. Understanding these dynamics is essential for navigating the complexities of EU legal and regulatory systems.",
