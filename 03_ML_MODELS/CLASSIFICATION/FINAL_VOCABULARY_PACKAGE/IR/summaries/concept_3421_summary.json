  "summary": "The concept of \"strategic nuclear weapon\" pertains to advanced military capabilities designed for deterrence and defense within the context of EU security policy. These weapons are characterized by their long-range delivery systems, which can target adversaries with precision. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, strategic nuclear weapons are subject to various treaties and agreements aimed at non-proliferation and arms control, such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The EU actively engages in discussions to promote disarmament and ensure that strategic nuclear arsenals do not escalate tensions within the region, emphasizing diplomatic solutions and collective security measures.",
