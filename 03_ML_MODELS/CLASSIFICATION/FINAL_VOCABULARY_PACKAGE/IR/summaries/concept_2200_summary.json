  "summary": "The concept of \"NATO countries\" refers to the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, an intergovernmental military alliance established for collective defense. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, NATO countries play a significant role in shaping security policies and defense cooperation among European Union member states. The EU often collaborates with NATO to enhance regional stability, counter threats, and promote peace. This relationship is crucial for aligning defense strategies and ensuring interoperability among armed forces, thereby reinforcing the EU's geopolitical stance and commitment to collective security in a rapidly evolving political landscape.",
