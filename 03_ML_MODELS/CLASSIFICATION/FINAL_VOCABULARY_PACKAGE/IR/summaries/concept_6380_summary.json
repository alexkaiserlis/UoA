  "summary": "The concept of \"defence statistics\" pertains to the systematic collection and analysis of data related to national and EU defence capabilities, expenditures, and activities. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these statistics serve as crucial instruments for transparency, accountability, and informed decision-making in defence policy. They facilitate the assessment of member states' compliance with EU obligations and contribute to the formulation of collective defence strategies. By providing a comprehensive overview of defence resources and trends, defence statistics are essential for enhancing cooperation among EU member states and ensuring effective resource allocation in the realm of security and defence.",
