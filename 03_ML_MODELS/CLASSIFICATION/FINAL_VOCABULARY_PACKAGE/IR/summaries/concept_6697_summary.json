  "summary": "Energy diversification is a pivotal concept within EU energy policy, aimed at enhancing energy security and sustainability. It involves the strategic development of a varied energy mix, reducing reliance on a single source or supplier. This regulatory approach seeks to mitigate risks associated with energy supply disruptions and price volatility. By promoting renewable energy sources, alternative fuels, and interconnections among member states, the EU fosters resilience in its energy infrastructure. Legal frameworks, such as the Energy Union strategy, underscore the importance of energy diversification in achieving climate goals and ensuring a competitive internal market, thereby aligning with broader EU objectives of sustainability and security.",
