  "summary": "The concept of \"surrogate mother\" pertains to the legal and regulatory frameworks surrounding assisted reproductive technologies within the EU. A surrogate mother is an individual who carries and gives birth to a child on behalf of another person or couple, often involving complex legal considerations regarding parental rights, citizenship, and the status of the child. EU member states exhibit varying regulations on surrogacy, with some recognizing surrogacy agreements while others prohibit them outright. This divergence raises significant legal challenges, including issues of cross-border recognition of parental rights and the ethical implications of surrogacy arrangements, necessitating harmonization efforts within EU law.",
