  "summary": "Historical geography, as a concept within the realm of natural and applied sciences, pertains to the study of how geographical phenomena have evolved over time. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, understanding historical geography is crucial for assessing land use policies, environmental regulations, and cultural heritage protections. It provides a framework for interpreting historical land claims and informs decisions regarding territorial governance. By analyzing historical geographical data, EU institutions can better address contemporary challenges such as urbanization, climate change, and biodiversity conservation, ensuring that regulatory measures are grounded in a comprehensive understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics.",
