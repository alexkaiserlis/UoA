  "summary": "Sucrose, a predominant compound in the sugar category, is a key ingredient in various beverages and foodstuffs regulated under EU law. Its crystallization process involves precise examinations, including refractometry, to ensure quality and compliance. Sucrose is often derived from cane and is soluble in aqueous solutions, making it essential for sweetened drinks and syrups. The EU regulations classify sucrose based on its strength and potential residue, addressing concerns related to acidity and deacidification. Additionally, the legal framework incorporates provisions for alcoholic beverages, ensuring that the incidence of sucrose in products is accurately matched and documented, thereby supporting consumer safety and transparency.",
