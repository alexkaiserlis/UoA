  "summary": "The concept of \"ballistic missile\" pertains to the category of defence within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Ballistic missiles are weapons capable of delivering payloads over significant distances, often linked to proliferation concerns. The EU actively engages in universalisation efforts to curb the development and launch of such weapons, particularly in relation to states like the DPRK. Regulatory measures include sanctions and vigilance against contravening entities involved in brokering missile technology. The EU's approach emphasizes restraint and the enhancement of peace through unified actions, including the condemnation of missile launches and the reinforcement of international treaties, such as those established in The Hague.",
