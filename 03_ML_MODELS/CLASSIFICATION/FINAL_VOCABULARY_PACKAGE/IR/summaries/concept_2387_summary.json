  "summary": "The \"tariff ceiling\" concept within the EU's 2011 tariff policy embodies a regulatory framework that establishes maximum limits on import duties. This mechanism is crucial for beneficiaries, ensuring that trade remains uninterruptedly beneficial amidst varying economic situations. The tariff ceiling applies to various products, including seafood like mussels and crab, and agricultural goods such as lettuce and gluten. It regulates preferential trade agreements, particularly concerning the Faeroese and Yugoslavian contexts. By rationalizing import duties, the EU manages to maintain a balanced trade environment, preventing excessive increments while addressing concerns regarding regularizations and potential lapses in compliance. This framework is essential for ensuring fair competition and continuity in trade relations.",
