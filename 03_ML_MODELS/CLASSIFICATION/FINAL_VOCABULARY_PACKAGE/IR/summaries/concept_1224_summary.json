  "summary": "The concept of \"milk-replacer feed,\" categorized under agricultural activity, is a redirect to the preferred term \"animal feedingstuffs.\" This category encompasses specialized formulations designed to provide essential nutrients to herbivores, particularly during convalescence or when natural milk is unavailable. Ingredients may include selenised compounds, such as selenium, and additives like propionibacterium and galactosidase, which enhance digestibility and flowability. Regulatory frameworks ensure that these feeds, often in pellet form, are appetising and safe for livestock, including cattlefeed. The inclusion of vitamins like niacin and nicotinic acid, along with anticaking agents like bentonite, is crucial for optimal health. Compliance with EU standards, such as those from Zoetis and Krka, is mandatory to ensure the efficacy and safety of these products.",
