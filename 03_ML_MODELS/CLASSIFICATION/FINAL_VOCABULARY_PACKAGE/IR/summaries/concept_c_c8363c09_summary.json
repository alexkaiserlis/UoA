  "summary": "The concept of \"transnational perspective,\" redirected to the preferred term \"cross-border dimension,\" emphasizes the importance of regional policies that transcend national boundaries within the European Union. This perspective is crucial for fostering cooperation among regions, enhancing economic integration, and addressing shared challenges such as environmental sustainability and social cohesion. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the cross-border dimension facilitates the development of joint initiatives, funding programs, and strategic partnerships that leverage regional strengths. By promoting a collaborative approach, the EU aims to harmonize policies and regulations, ultimately contributing to a more cohesive and integrated European region.",
