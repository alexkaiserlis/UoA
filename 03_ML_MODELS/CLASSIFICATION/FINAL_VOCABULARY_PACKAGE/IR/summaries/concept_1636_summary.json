  "summary": "The concept of \"right to commit suicide,\" categorized under \"rights and freedoms,\" is more appropriately referred to as \"freedom of self-determination\" within EU legal frameworks. This term encapsulates the broader principle that individuals possess autonomy over their own lives, including the decision to end them. While EU regulations emphasize the protection of human rights, the issue remains contentious, intersecting with ethical, medical, and legal considerations. The EU's approach to this sensitive matter reflects a commitment to individual liberties while balancing societal values and the potential implications for public health and safety.",
