  "summary": "Climatology, a branch of natural and applied sciences, plays a pivotal role in shaping EU legal and regulatory frameworks concerning environmental protection and climate change mitigation. It encompasses the study of climate patterns and their impact on ecosystems, which informs policy decisions aimed at achieving sustainability. The EU relies on climatological data to formulate regulations that address greenhouse gas emissions, promote renewable energy sources, and enhance resilience to climate-related risks. Understanding climatology is essential for developing effective strategies that align with the EU's commitments under international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, thereby ensuring compliance with environmental standards and fostering a sustainable future.",
