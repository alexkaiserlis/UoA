  "summary": "Prostitution, as addressed in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, involves complex issues concerning human beings, including the trafficking of victims. The European Union aims to combat these challenges through various directives and protocols, ensuring the protection and freedom of individuals involved. The adoption of documents, such as the JHA framework, reflects the intention of member states, including Ireland and the United Kingdom, to create a cohesive area of security and justice. Articles within these texts outline the responsibilities of states to prevent exploitation and replace harmful practices with authentic support systems. The official position of the EU, notified in various journals, emphasizes the necessity of combating trafficking and protecting victims in accordance with adopted legislation.",
