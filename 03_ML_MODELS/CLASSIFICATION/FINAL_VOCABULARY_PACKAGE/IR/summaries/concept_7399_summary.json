  "summary": "Natural law refers to a philosophical and legal theory positing that certain rights and moral values are inherent in human nature and can be discerned through reason. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, natural law serves as a foundational principle influencing the development of human rights legislation and the interpretation of legal norms. It underpins the notion that laws should reflect universal moral standards, thereby guiding the EU's commitment to uphold fundamental rights and justice. While not codified as statutory law, natural law remains a critical reference point in discussions surrounding the legitimacy and ethical dimensions of EU policies and regulations.",
