  "summary": "Bilingualism, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the official recognition and use of two languages in various institutional settings. This concept is pivotal for ensuring equitable access to EU legislation, facilitating communication among member states, and promoting cultural diversity. The EU's commitment to bilingualism is reflected in its multilingual policy, which mandates that legal documents be available in multiple languages, thereby enhancing transparency and inclusivity. This linguistic approach not only supports the rights of citizens but also fosters mutual understanding, crucial for effective governance and cooperation in the diverse linguistic landscape of Europe.",
