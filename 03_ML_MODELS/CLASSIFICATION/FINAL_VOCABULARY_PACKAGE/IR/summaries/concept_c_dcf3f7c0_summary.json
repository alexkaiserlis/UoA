  "summary": "\"Systemic risk,\" as categorized under the free movement of capital, pertains to the potential for widespread financial instability within the EU's financial system. This concept is closely related to \"financial risk,\" which serves as the preferred term. Systemic risk encompasses the interconnectedness of financial institutions and markets, where the failure of one entity can trigger a cascade of adverse effects across the entire system.
