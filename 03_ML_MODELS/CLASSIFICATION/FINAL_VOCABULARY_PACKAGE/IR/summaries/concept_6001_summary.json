  "summary": "The term \"peasant class\" refers to a socio-economic group traditionally associated with agricultural labor and rural communities. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is significant for understanding social equity and rural development policies. The peasant class often faces unique challenges, including access to resources, land rights, and market participation. EU regulations aim to address these issues through various initiatives, such as the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which seeks to enhance the livelihoods of rural populations. Recognizing the peasant class is crucial for fostering inclusive growth and ensuring sustainable agricultural practices within the EU's social framework.",
