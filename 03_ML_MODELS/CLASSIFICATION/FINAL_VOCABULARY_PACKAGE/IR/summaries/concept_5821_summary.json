  "summary": "The term \"practitioner of alternative medicine\" refers to individuals who provide health services through non-conventional therapeutic practices, which may include acupuncture, homeopathy, and herbal medicine. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, practitioners of alternative medicine are subject to varying degrees of oversight, depending on member state legislation. The EU emphasizes patient safety, requiring practitioners to adhere to specific standards and regulations to ensure the efficacy and safety of their treatments. While alternative medicine is increasingly recognized, its practitioners must navigate complex regulatory landscapes to operate legally and ethically within the EU health sector.",
