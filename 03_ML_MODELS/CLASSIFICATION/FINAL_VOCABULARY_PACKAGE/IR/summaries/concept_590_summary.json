  "summary": "The concept of \"prolongation of studies,\" redirected to the preferred term \"length of studies,\" pertains to the regulatory framework governing educational durations within the EU. This concept addresses the legal implications of extending the time required to complete educational programs, which can impact student rights, funding allocations, and institutional accountability. In the context of EU legislation, it is essential to ensure that any prolongation aligns with the principles of equal access to education and non-discrimination. By standardizing the length of studies, the EU aims to enhance educational quality and facilitate student mobility across member states, fostering a cohesive educational environment.",
