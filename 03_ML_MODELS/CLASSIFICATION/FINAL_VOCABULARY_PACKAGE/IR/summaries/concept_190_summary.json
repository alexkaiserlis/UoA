  "summary": "Parliamentary scrutiny refers to the systematic examination and oversight conducted by the European Parliament over various EU legislative and regulatory processes. This mechanism ensures accountability and transparency within the EU's institutional framework, allowing parliamentarians to assess the implications of proposed legislation and policies. Through parliamentary scrutiny, the Parliament can influence decision-making, engage in debates, and hold the European Commission and other bodies accountable for their actions. This process is crucial for democratic legitimacy, as it enables elected representatives to voice constituents' concerns and ensures that EU governance remains responsive and aligned with the principles of the rule of law.",
