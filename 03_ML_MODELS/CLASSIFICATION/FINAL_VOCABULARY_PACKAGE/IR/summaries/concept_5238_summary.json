  "summary": "The concept of \"space research\" encompasses various fields related to the exploration and utilization of outer space, particularly within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks. It includes the GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) programme, which monitors Earthâ€™s environment and supports decision-making. The EU engages in cooperation agreements with contracting parties, including Iceland and EEA states, to extend research capabilities. These arrangements are subject to specific protocols and amendments, ensuring compliance with applicable regulations. Monitoring operations are integral to the functioning of joint initiatives, which are periodically reviewed and may be amended accordingly to enhance their effectiveness and relevance.",
