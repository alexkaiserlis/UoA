  "summary": "The concept of \"work physiology,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"occupational physiology,\" pertains to the study of how work-related activities impact human health and performance. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, occupational physiology is crucial for establishing standards that ensure safe and healthy working conditions. It informs directives related to workplace ergonomics, employee well-being, and risk assessment. By integrating principles of occupational physiology, EU regulations aim to enhance productivity while safeguarding workers' health, thereby promoting a sustainable work environment. This concept is essential for compliance with EU legislation on occupational safety and health.",
