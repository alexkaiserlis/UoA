  "summary": "An \"implementing directive\" is a legal instrument within the framework of European Union law, specifically designed to ensure the uniform application of EU legislation across member states. It provides detailed provisions necessary for the execution of directives, thereby facilitating their effective implementation at the national level. Unlike regulations, which are directly applicable, implementing directives require transposition into national law, allowing member states some discretion in how they achieve compliance. This mechanism is essential for harmonizing legal standards and practices, ensuring that EU objectives are met consistently throughout the Union, thus promoting legal certainty and coherence in the internal market.",
