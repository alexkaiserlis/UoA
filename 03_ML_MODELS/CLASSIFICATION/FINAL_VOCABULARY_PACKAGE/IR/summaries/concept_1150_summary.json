  "summary": "Political geography, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the spatial distribution of political power and governance structures across Europe. It encompasses the analysis of territorial boundaries, regional governance, and the impact of geographical factors on political processes. Understanding political geography is essential for EU institutions when formulating policies that address regional disparities, electoral systems, and cross-border cooperation. This concept aids in the assessment of how geographical contexts influence legislative effectiveness and public administration, thereby ensuring that EU regulations are responsive to the diverse political landscapes of member states.",
