  "summary": "Hydrogeology, a sub-discipline of natural and applied sciences, plays a crucial role in EU legal and regulatory frameworks concerning water resource management. It encompasses the study of groundwater, its distribution, movement, and quality, which are vital for sustainable development and environmental protection. EU directives, such as the Water Framework Directive, emphasize the importance of hydrogeological assessments in ensuring the protection of water bodies and the sustainable use of aquifers. Understanding hydrogeology is essential for compliance with regulations aimed at preventing pollution and managing water scarcity, thereby supporting the EU's objectives for ecological balance and public health.",
