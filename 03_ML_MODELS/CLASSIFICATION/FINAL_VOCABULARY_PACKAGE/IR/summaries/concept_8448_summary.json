  "summary": "The concept of \"premature marriage,\" which is redirected to \"forced marriage,\" pertains to legal and regulatory frameworks within the EU that address the violation of individual autonomy in matrimonial choices. Forced marriage is characterized by the imposition of marriage without the free and informed consent of one or both parties, often violating fundamental human rights. The EU has established various directives and regulations aimed at combating forced marriage, recognizing it as a significant issue affecting family law and social justice. This concept underscores the importance of protecting individuals, particularly minors, from coercive practices that undermine their personal freedoms and legal rights.",
