  "summary": "The \"Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries\" (OAPEC) is an intergovernmental organization that plays a significant role in the global energy sector, particularly in the regulation and coordination of petroleum policies among its member states. As an extra-European organisation, OAPEC's activities are relevant to EU legal and regulatory frameworks, especially concerning energy security, trade agreements, and environmental standards. The EU engages with OAPEC to foster dialogue on sustainable energy practices and to address challenges related to oil supply and market stability. This redirect to the preferred term underscores the importance of OAPEC in the context of international energy governance.",
