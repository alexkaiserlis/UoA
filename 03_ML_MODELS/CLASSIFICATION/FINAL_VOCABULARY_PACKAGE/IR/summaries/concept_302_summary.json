  "summary": "The concept \"Equatorial Africa,\" categorized under \"Africa,\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"Central Africa.\" This region faces irregular threats, including immigration challenges and the need for enhanced consular representation. The EU's regulatory framework, particularly the Schengen acquis, addresses the deployment of biometrics, such as fingerprint and photograph collection, to solve irregular immigration issues. Europol plays a crucial role in fighting organized crime, while the feasibility of visa policies impacts nationals from this area. The EU aims to protect its borders by equipping offices worldwide to detect irregular entries, thereby addressing gaps in security and enhancing cooperation with southern African nations.",
