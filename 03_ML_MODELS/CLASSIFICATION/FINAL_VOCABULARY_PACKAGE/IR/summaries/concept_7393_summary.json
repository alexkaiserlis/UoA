  "summary": "The \"sociology of education\" is a critical field within the humanities that examines the interplay between educational systems and societal structures. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept informs policies aimed at promoting social inclusion, equity, and lifelong learning. By analyzing educational practices through a sociological lens, policymakers can identify systemic inequalities and develop targeted interventions. The sociology of education also plays a pivotal role in shaping EU directives related to educational standards, multiculturalism, and the integration of marginalized groups. Understanding this relationship is essential for fostering an inclusive educational environment across member states.",
