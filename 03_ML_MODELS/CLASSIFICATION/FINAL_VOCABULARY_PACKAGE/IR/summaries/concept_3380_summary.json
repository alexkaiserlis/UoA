  "summary": "Rent regulations refer to the legal frameworks established within the European Union to govern the rental market, ensuring fairness and stability in housing. These regulations encompass various aspects, including rent control, tenant rights, and landlord obligations, aimed at preventing exploitation and promoting equitable access to housing. In the context of construction and town planning, rent regulations play a crucial role in urban development, influencing housing supply and affordability. The EU encourages member states to adopt coherent rent regulations that align with broader social and economic policies, fostering sustainable urban environments while safeguarding the interests of both tenants and landlords.",
