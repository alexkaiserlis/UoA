  "summary": "The concept of \"advisory power\" within the EU political framework refers to the capacity of institutions to provide guidance and recommendations on regulatory matters. This power is crucial for ensuring efficient coordination among various parties involved in policy development. Advisory bodies often organise consultations that relate to the spectrum of issues affecting users and industry stakeholders. Such institutions may appear in directives that aim to amend existing regulations, ensuring their relevance in light of technological developments. The advisory power facilitates harmonised approaches to electronic communications and transport, enhancing the availability of services across the internal market. Hereinafter, it plays a pivotal role in adapting to evolving needs and fostering collaboration among interested groups.",
