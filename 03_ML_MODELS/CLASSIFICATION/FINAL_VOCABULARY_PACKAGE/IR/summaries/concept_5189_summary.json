  "summary": "High-definition television (HDTV) represents a significant advancement in broadcast technology, shaping the landscape of communications within the EU. As a prototype of modern broadcasting, HDTV utilizes advanced encoding techniques, including encryption, to enhance the viewing experience. The European Commission has prioritized the commercialization of HDTV, ensuring that broadcasters can deliver high-quality transmissions via various platforms, including cable and satellite (FSS). Regulatory frameworks, such as those established by the ITU and CCIR, address technical standards and norms, facilitating simulcast capabilities and minimizing discontinuities in service. This evolution also aligns with ecodesign principles, promoting sustainable hardware development for receivers and screens.",
