  "summary": "Economic interdependence refers to the interconnectedness of economies, particularly within the European Union (EU), where member states rely on each other for trade, investment, and resources. This concept is pivotal in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, as it underpins policies aimed at fostering a single market and ensuring competitive neutrality. The EU's regulatory measures, such as competition law and trade agreements, are designed to enhance economic interdependence, promoting stability and growth among member states. By recognizing the significance of economic interdependence, the EU aims to mitigate risks associated with economic disparities and enhance collective prosperity across the region.",
