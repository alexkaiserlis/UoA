  "summary": "The concept of \"national income\" is integral to the EU's regulatory framework, particularly within the context of national accounts as defined by the European System of Accounts (ESA). It encompasses various measures, including Gross National Income (GNI) and Gross National Product (GNP), which are essential for the calculation and compilation of economic data. National income serves as a criterion for assessing the economic performance of member states, ensuring harmonisation across territories. The European Commission establishes procedures for the forwarding of data related to national income, which is used for budgetary purposes and energy market analysis. This concept lays the foundation for effective resource allocation and economic policy development within the EU.",
