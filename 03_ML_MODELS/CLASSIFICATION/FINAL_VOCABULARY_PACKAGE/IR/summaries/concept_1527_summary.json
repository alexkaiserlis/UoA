  "summary": "The term \"tombola,\" categorized under social affairs, is a redirect to the preferred term \"game of chance.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, games of chance, including tombolas, are subject to various regulations aimed at ensuring fair play and preventing manipulation. The European Parliament and Council (EPAS) have engaged in negotiations to establish binding instruments that govern the distribution and operation of such games. These discussions often involve ministers and judicial bodies to combat illegal activities and ensure compliance with TFEU principles. Recommendations and resolutions are periodically issued to assess the feasibility of new regulations, indicating a commitment to precise oversight in this area.",
