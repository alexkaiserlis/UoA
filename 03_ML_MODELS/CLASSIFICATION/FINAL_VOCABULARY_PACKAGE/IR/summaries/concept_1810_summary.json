  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"public contract\" refers to agreements established between procurers and suppliers for the provision of goods, services, or works, often governed by directives such as SIMAP and CPC. These contracts are essential for ensuring transparent and competitive procurements, leveraging scalable and extensible systems like UBL and ebXML for efficient processing. Public contracts also involve intricate vocabulary related to cryptographic security measures, such as DNSSEC and domainkeys, to safeguard data integrity. The regulatory landscape is structured to facilitate compliance with standards, ensuring that all parties adhere to the principles of fair competition and accountability, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of public procurement processes across the EU.",
