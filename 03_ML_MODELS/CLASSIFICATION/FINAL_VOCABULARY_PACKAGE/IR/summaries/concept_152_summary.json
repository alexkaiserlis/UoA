  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"farm building\" is redirected to \"agricultural building,\" which fundamentally encompasses structures utilized for various agricultural practices, including housing for livestock such as hens and goats. These buildings are crucial for modernizing agricultural production, ensuring compliance with regulations on organic farming and animal welfare. The designating of such buildings often involves considerations of savings and lending practices related to agricultural investments. Additionally, regulations may stipulate exemptions for specific structures, influencing the reallocation of resources. The cessation of outdated practices is essential for enhancing efficiency in haulage and production, ultimately benefiting the agricultural sector's sustainability.",
