  "summary": "The \"World Trade Organization\" (WTO), a pivotal entity in global trade governance, operates multilaterally to adjudicate trade disputes and facilitate negotiations among member states. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the WTO's sistema integrated approach influences various sectors, including textiles and agriculture. For instance, the EU's regulations on synthethic materials, such as elastan and lyocell, are shaped by WTO agreements. Furthermore, the organization investigates trade practices, ensuring compliance with international standards. The EU's engagement with the WTO involves communicating trade policies through instruments like siscomex and adhering to commitments on liquified natural gas and other commodities. As such, the WTO is essential for maintaining a balanced trade environment, where member states can carve out equitable agreements while addressing issues like underuse of resources and stockholding practices.",
