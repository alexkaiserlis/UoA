  "summary": "Political unrest refers to a state of civil disorder or instability that can arise from various socio-economic and political factors, impacting public safety and governance within the European Union. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, political unrest may necessitate the implementation of specific measures to ensure the protection of fundamental rights and the maintenance of order. The EU may respond to such unrest through diplomatic channels, sanctions, or by providing support to member states facing significant challenges. Understanding political unrest is crucial for policymakers to develop effective strategies that uphold democratic values and public safety across the Union.",
