  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"misinformation\" is often redirected to the preferred term \"disinformation.\" Disinformation refers to deliberately false or misleading information disseminated with the intent to deceive, which poses significant challenges to public discourse and democratic processes. The EU has recognized the detrimental effects of disinformation on societal cohesion and informed decision-making, prompting the development of regulatory measures aimed at combating its spread, particularly in digital communications. These measures include initiatives to enhance transparency, accountability, and media literacy, thereby fostering an informed citizenry capable of critically assessing information sources.",
