  "summary": "The \"right of asylum\" is a fundamental principle in international law, particularly within EU legal frameworks, ensuring protection for individuals fleeing persecution. This right is interdependent with various legal instruments, including the Geneva Convention and EU directives. Asylum seekers must navigate bureaucratic processes, including resettlement and readmission procedures, which are often complemented by national laws. The EU employs a codecision mechanism to enhance accessibility and integration of asylum policies across member states. Courts interpret asylum claims, while tribunals assess intentions and circumstances of applicants from countries like Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The right of asylum is crucial for upholding human rights and citizenship within the EU.",
