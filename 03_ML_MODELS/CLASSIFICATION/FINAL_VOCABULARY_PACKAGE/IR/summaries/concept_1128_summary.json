  "summary": "\"The Gambia\" is a significant concept within the EU's economic geography framework, particularly concerning fisheries and aquaculture regulations. The EU has drafted agreements that empower member states to enjoy jurisdiction over fishing vessels in Gambian waters. These agreements often include assurances regarding the sustainable management of fishery resources, with provisions for inspection and verification of compliance. The Ministry of Fisheries in The Gambia plays a crucial role in this context, as it is responsible for issuing certificates that mark the fulfilment of regulatory requirements. Additionally, the EU's packages for cooperation with The Gambia include indispensable additions aimed at enhancing sustainable fishing practices and ensuring that fishermen can operate effectively without interruption.",
