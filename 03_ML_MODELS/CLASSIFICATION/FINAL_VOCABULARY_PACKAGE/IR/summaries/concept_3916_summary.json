  "summary": "The concept of \"children's rights\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses the protection and promotion of children's welfare, as governed by various international instruments. The EU has ratified conventions that bind contracting parties to uphold these rights, ensuring that judgments affecting children are rendered with their best interests in mind. This includes the maintenance of family relationships and mutual recognition of rights across jurisdictions. The enforcement of children's rights is crucial; ineffective measures can undermine their protection. The EU considers amendments to existing laws to enhance compliance and authorises actions that support satisfactory recovery and safeguarding of children's rights, as envisaged in relevant legal texts.",
