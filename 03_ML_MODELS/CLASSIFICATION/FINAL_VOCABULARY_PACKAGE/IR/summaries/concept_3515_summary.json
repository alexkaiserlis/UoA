  "summary": "Long-term unemployment refers to the situation where individuals remain unemployed for an extended period, typically defined as 12 months or longer. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, long-term unemployment poses significant challenges to social cohesion and economic stability. The European Union has implemented various policies aimed at reducing long-term unemployment, including the European Social Fund and the Youth Employment Initiative, which provide financial support and training programs. These initiatives are designed to enhance employability, promote active labor market policies, and facilitate reintegration into the workforce, thereby addressing the adverse effects of prolonged joblessness on individuals and society.",
