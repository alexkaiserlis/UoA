  "summary": "The term \"conformity deficit\" refers to a situation within the European Union legal framework where there is a lack of alignment between national legislation and EU directives or regulations. This deficit can arise when Member States fail to fully implement or comply with EU law, leading to inconsistencies in legal standards across the Union. Such discrepancies can undermine the effectiveness of the internal market and hinder the realization of EU objectives. Addressing conformity deficits is crucial for ensuring legal harmonization and the protection of fundamental rights, thereby fostering a cohesive regulatory environment that upholds the principles of EU law.",
