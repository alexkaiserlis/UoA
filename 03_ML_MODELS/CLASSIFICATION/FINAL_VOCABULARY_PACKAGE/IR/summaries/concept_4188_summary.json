  "summary": "Socialism, as a political framework within the EU context, refers to an ideology advocating for social ownership and democratic control of the means of production. It emphasizes the importance of social welfare, equity, and collective decision-making in governance. In EU legal and regulatory documents, socialism may intersect with discussions on social policy, labor rights, and economic regulation. While not a predominant framework in EU treaties, its principles influence various directives aimed at promoting social cohesion and reducing inequalities among member states. Understanding socialism is essential for analyzing the EU's approach to balancing market economies with social justice objectives.",
