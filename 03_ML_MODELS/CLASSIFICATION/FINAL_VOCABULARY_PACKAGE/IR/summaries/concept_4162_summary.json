  "summary": "In the context of EU transport policy, \"traffic signs\" encompass a range of regulatory fixtures essential for safe navigation across terrestrial and maritime channels. These signs serve as vital beacons, aiding navigators in harsh conditions, such as snow in the Alps or submerged hazards near aerodromes. The EU mandates interoperability of traffic signs with radionavigation systems like LORAN and Omega, ensuring excellent communication for coastguard operations and disaster rescue missions. The implementation of these signs must address potential incompatibilities with existing systems, while also considering the attestation of installed equipment. This regulatory framework builds resilience against disasters and enhances safety across the Iberian Peninsula and Baltic regions.",
