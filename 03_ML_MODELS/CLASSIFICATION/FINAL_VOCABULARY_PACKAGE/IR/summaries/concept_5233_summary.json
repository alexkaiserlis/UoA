  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"quality standard\" refers to established criteria that ensure the consistency and safety of products, including agricultural goods such as kiwifruit and plantains. These standards facilitate the identification of products like tulips, including varieties such as tulipa and hyacinthus, ensuring they ripen uniformly and maintain a high level of homogenity. Quality standards also apply to technical regulations governing the production of goods, ensuring that items like the elongated, ribbed onion or the stocky hass avocado meet specific requirements. Compliance with these standards fosters constancy in product quality, enhancing consumer trust and market stability across the EU.",
