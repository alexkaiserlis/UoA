  "summary": "The concept of \"parliamentary monarchy,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"constitutional monarchy,\" is pivotal in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks. A constitutional monarchy is characterized by a political system where the monarch's powers are limited by a constitution or legislative body, ensuring a balance of authority. This framework is essential for maintaining democratic governance within EU member states, as it delineates the roles of the monarchy and parliament. By establishing a legal foundation for governance, constitutional monarchies contribute to the rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights, aligning with EU principles of democracy and human rights.",
