  "summary": "A \"land bank\" refers to a strategic reserve of land held by public or private entities, primarily aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity and ensuring sustainable farming systems within the EU. This concept is integral to EU legal frameworks that promote land use efficiency and agricultural development. Land banks facilitate the acquisition, management, and redistribution of agricultural land, thereby supporting rural development and food security initiatives. By providing access to land for new farmers and promoting land consolidation, land banks play a crucial role in addressing challenges such as land fragmentation and environmental sustainability, aligning with EU regulatory objectives in the agricultural sector.",
