  "summary": "The concept of \"cemetery\" falls within the category of construction and town planning in EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Cemeteries are designated areas for the interment of the deceased, governed by specific regulations that ensure public health, environmental protection, and urban planning compliance. In the EU, member states are responsible for establishing legal frameworks that address the construction, maintenance, and management of cemeteries, often integrating them into broader town planning strategies. These regulations may encompass zoning laws, land use policies, and cultural considerations, reflecting the importance of cemeteries in community heritage and urban development.",
