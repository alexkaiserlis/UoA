  "summary": "The concept of \"wireless telecommunications,\" redirected to \"radio telecommunications,\" encompasses a broad spectrum of technologies and regulatory frameworks within the EU. It includes the use of transceivers for radiocommunication, essential for applications such as avionics and situational awareness in air traffic management (ATFM). The Wireless Radio Conference (WRC) plays a pivotal role in defining standards for radiolocation and radiodetermination, ensuring interoperability. Regulatory bodies oversee the digitalisation of services, addressing issues like intermodulation and disconnections in networks. The integration of technologies, such as PMSE (Programme Making and Special Events) microphones, is crucial for enhancing communication in diverse environments, from theatrical productions to everyday use.",
