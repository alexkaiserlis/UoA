  "summary": "Diplomatic protection is a principle in international law whereby a state extends its protection to its nationals abroad, particularly when they face violations of their rights. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, diplomatic protection is crucial for safeguarding the interests of EU citizens in third countries. The EU promotes a cohesive approach to diplomatic protection, ensuring that member states collaborate in addressing grievances against their nationals. This concept underscores the EU's commitment to human rights and the rule of law, facilitating mechanisms for effective redress and support for individuals facing injustices outside their home state.",
