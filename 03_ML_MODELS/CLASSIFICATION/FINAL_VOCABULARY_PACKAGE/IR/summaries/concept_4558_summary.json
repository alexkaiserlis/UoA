  "summary": "The term \"frontier worker\" refers to individuals who reside in one EU Member State but travel to another for work, thereby embracing the concept of cross-border employment. This status involves specific entitlements and exemptions regarding taxation and social security, facilitating easier movement across frontiers. The gradual harmonization of regulations aims to abolish barriers, ensuring that these workers can benefit from progressive rights similar to domestic employees. Governments have dealt with the complexities of this status through declarations and resolutions, progressively simplifying the controls on travel and exportation of labor. Henceforth, the achievement of a cohesive labor market is paramount for the EU's economic turnover.",
