  "summary": "The concept of \"budget\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework encompasses a comprehensive system for public finance and budget policy. It relates to the allocation of resources for various operational phases, including humanitarian missions like EUPOL and EULEX, which aim to support foreign affairs in regions such as Kosovo and Palestine. The budgetary process is governed by successive contributions from member states, which are crucial for achieving inclusive and favourable outcomes. It fixes estimated sums for emergency situations, ensuring that agencies can conduct their operations effectively. The budget also covers guidance for the Mediterranean region, addressing issues that may impede development and improve overall governance.",
