  "summary": "The concept of \"population projection,\" redirected to the preferred term \"population forecast,\" is crucial in EU legal and regulatory frameworks concerning demographic analysis. Population forecasts are essential for planning and implementing policies that address social, economic, and environmental challenges within the EU. These projections utilize statistical models to estimate future population trends, including age distribution and migration patterns. Accurate population forecasts inform legislative measures, resource allocation, and social services planning, ensuring that EU member states can effectively respond to demographic changes. This concept underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making in shaping sustainable policies across the European Union.",
