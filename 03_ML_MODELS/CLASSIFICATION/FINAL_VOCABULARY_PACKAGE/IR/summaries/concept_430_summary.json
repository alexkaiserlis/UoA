  "summary": "The concept of \"integrated development\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks presupposes a holistic approach to economic conditions, emphasizing the productive utilization of resources and infrastructures. This strategy aims to address shortcomings in regional disparities, particularly in areas like Mezzogiorno and Abruzzo, where isolation has hindered growth. By instituting specialized committees, the EU seeks to exploit synergies through digitalization and telecommunication advancements, facilitating commuting and connectivity. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) plays a pivotal role in funding projects that demonstrate additionality, ensuring that breakthroughs in technology and job creation are indexed to local needs. This integrated approach covers diverse phases of development, fostering publicity and contacts among stakeholders across regions like Lesbos and Corsica, ultimately aiming for a fuller economic integration across member states.",
