  "summary": "The concept of \"international agreement (EU)\" refers to legally binding accords that the European Union enters into with third countries or international organizations. These agreements, often initialled during seminars, encompass various domains, including trade, peacekeeping, and jurisdictional matters. For instance, the ACAA (Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products) facilitates nonagricultural procurements. Such agreements are elaborated in accordance with EU law and may involve complex negotiations, as seen in the context of the Visegrad Group or discussions surrounding Lichtenstein's participation. They aim to ensure orderly relations and address issues like imports and exports, impacting sectors from cosmeceuticals to fisheries. The preferred term \"agreement (EU)\" encapsulates these multifaceted legal instruments, which are crucial for the EU's external relations and regulatory framework.",
