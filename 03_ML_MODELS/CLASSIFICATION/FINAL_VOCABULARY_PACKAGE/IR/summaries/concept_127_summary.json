  "summary": "The concept of \"rejection of a bill\" within EU parliamentary proceedings refers to the decision made by a qualified majority in the Council or the European Parliament to not adopt a proposed law. This process is crucial for ensuring that legislation aligns with the interests of the Union. When a bill is rejected, it signifies that the proposed measures, concerning various policy areas, do not meet the necessary support among member states or representatives. The adoption of a law by vote is thus a pivotal mechanism in the legislative framework, allowing for democratic decision-making and reflecting the collective will of the Union's institutions.",
