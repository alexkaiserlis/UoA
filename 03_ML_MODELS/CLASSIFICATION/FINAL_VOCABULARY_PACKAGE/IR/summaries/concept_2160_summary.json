  "summary": "In the context of EU parliamentary proceedings, the term \"agenda\" refers to the structured outline of topics and issues scheduled for discussion and decision-making within legislative sessions. It serves as a critical tool for ensuring orderly debate and effective time management, facilitating the prioritization of legislative initiatives. The agenda is typically prepared by parliamentary committees and is essential for transparency and accountability in the legislative process. By delineating the matters to be addressed, the agenda enables Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to prepare adequately, fostering informed deliberation on complex regulatory issues pertinent to EU governance.",
