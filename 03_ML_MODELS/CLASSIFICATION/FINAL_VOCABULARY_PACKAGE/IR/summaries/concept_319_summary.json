  "summary": "Terrace cropping refers to an agricultural practice involving the cultivation of land on sloped terrain, where crops are grown in a series of steps or terraces. This method is significant in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning sustainable agriculture and land management. Terrace cropping enhances soil conservation, reduces erosion, and optimizes water retention, aligning with the EU's objectives for environmental protection and sustainable farming practices. The implementation of terrace cropping can be supported by various EU agricultural policies and funding programs aimed at promoting innovative cultivation techniques that contribute to biodiversity and the resilience of agricultural systems.",
