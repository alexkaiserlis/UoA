  "summary": "Gorenjska, a region in Slovenia, holds significant historical and cultural importance within the EU context. Known for its distinct culinary contributions, such as kranjska klobasa and various types of wurst, Gorenjska exemplifies the region's rich heritage. The delimitation of this area has been administratively acknowledged in EU regulations, ensuring fairness in its representation. Gorenjska's reputation is enhanced by its unique products, which have origins that are often misled by generic associations with neighbouring regions. The protection of these products under PGI status is crucial for preserving their distinctiveness and exploiting their market potential, thereby engaging local economies.",
