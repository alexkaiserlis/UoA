  "summary": "A \"planned economy\" refers to an economic structure where the state or central authority makes decisions regarding production, investment, prices, and incomes, contrasting with market-driven economies. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, planned economies are often scrutinized for their implications on competition and market dynamics. The EU promotes principles of free market competition, which can conflict with the objectives of a planned economy. Regulatory documents may address the balance between state intervention and market freedom, ensuring compliance with EU treaties that advocate for economic integration and the internal market's efficiency.",
