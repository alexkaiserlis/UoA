  "summary": "The concept of \"full employment\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks emphasizes the importance of engaging citizens in the labour market, particularly through reforms that attract young and older workers. The EU prioritizes lifelong learning and adaptability, investing in platforms that facilitate job creation and stability. Taskforces are established to address the demands of a changing economy, ensuring that governance structures are strictly aligned with the goal of achieving excellence in employment. The European Social Fund (ESF) plays a crucial role in funding initiatives that strengthen links between workers and employers, encouraging broad involvement and updating priorities to meet real-world challenges.",
