  "summary": "Political ecology is an interdisciplinary concept that examines the intricate relationships between political, economic, and environmental factors. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, it emphasizes the need for sustainable development policies that address ecological concerns while considering socio-political dynamics. This approach advocates for participatory governance, ensuring that marginalized communities are included in environmental decision-making processes. By integrating principles of justice and equity, political ecology informs EU directives aimed at promoting environmental protection and climate resilience, fostering a holistic understanding of environmental policy that transcends mere regulatory compliance to encompass broader societal impacts.",
