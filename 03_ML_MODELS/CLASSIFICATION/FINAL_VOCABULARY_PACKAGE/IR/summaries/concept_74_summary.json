  "summary": "The concept of \"non-matrimonial union,\" commonly referred to as \"cohabitation,\" pertains to the legal recognition of relationships outside traditional marriage within EU regulatory frameworks. Cohabitation encompasses various forms of partnership, where individuals live together and share a domestic life without formal marital status. This concept is significant in the context of family law, as it affects rights and obligations regarding property, inheritance, and social benefits. The EU acknowledges the diversity of family structures, promoting policies that enhance the legal protection of cohabiting partners, thereby ensuring equitable treatment in areas such as taxation, social security, and family law.",
