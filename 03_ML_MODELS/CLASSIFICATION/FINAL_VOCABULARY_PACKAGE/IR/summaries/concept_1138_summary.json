  "summary": "Leftism, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to a political ideology that advocates for social equality, collective ownership, and the redistribution of wealth. It often influences legislative initiatives aimed at enhancing social justice, labor rights, and public welfare. In the EU, leftist parties and movements engage in shaping policies that prioritize the welfare state and advocate for progressive taxation. While leftism is not a formal legal term, its principles can manifest in various EU directives and regulations aimed at promoting social cohesion and combating inequality across member states. Understanding leftism is essential for analyzing the political dynamics that inform EU governance.",
