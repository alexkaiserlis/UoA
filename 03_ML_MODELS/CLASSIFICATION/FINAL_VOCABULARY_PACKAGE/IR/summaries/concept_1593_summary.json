  "summary": "Delegated legislation refers to the legal framework whereby the European Union empowers its institutions, particularly the Commission, to adopt measures that supplement or amend existing legislation without the need for a new legislative act. This process is essential for the efficient implementation of EU laws, allowing for technical adjustments and detailed provisions that are necessary for the practical application of primary legislation. Delegated acts must adhere to specific conditions set out in the original legislative texts, ensuring accountability and oversight. This mechanism exemplifies the balance between executive power and legislative authority within the EU regulatory framework, facilitating a responsive governance structure.",
