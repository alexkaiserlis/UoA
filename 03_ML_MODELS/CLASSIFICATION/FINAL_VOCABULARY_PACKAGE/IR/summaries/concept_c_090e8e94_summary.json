  "summary": "The concept of \"language skills\" is crucial in the context of employment within the European Union, particularly in fostering a multilingual workforce. Proficiency in multiple languages enhances employability and is often a prerequisite for various positions, especially in EU institutions. Legal and regulatory frameworks emphasize the importance of language skills in promoting equal opportunities and non-discrimination in the labor market. Furthermore, language skills facilitate cross-border mobility and integration within the EU, aligning with the objectives of the Single Market. Thus, the enhancement of language skills is not only a personal asset but also a regulatory necessity for effective communication in diverse professional environments.",
