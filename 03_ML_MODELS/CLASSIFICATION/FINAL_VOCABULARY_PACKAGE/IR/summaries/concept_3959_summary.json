  "summary": "The \"confiscation of property\" in EU criminal law refers to the judicial process of seizing assets linked to criminal activities, particularly those involving illicit proceeds. This mechanism is pivotal for combating organized crime and enhancing law enforcement's ability to trace and recover assets. Practitioners advocate for streamlined procedures, enabling rapid execution of confiscation orders. The process involves police intelligence and judicial oversight to ensure that the motives for confiscation are legitimate and that the rights of individuals are respected. Techniques for freezing and exchanging information about criminal assets are essential tools in this regulatory framework, facilitating the refusal of criminals to profit from their actions.",
