  "summary": "Political propaganda refers to the dissemination of information, often biased or misleading, aimed at influencing public opinion and political behavior within the context of EU governance. This concept is critical in legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning electoral integrity, freedom of expression, and the regulation of media. The EU has established various directives and regulations to combat the adverse effects of political propaganda, ensuring transparency and accountability in political communication. Such measures are essential for safeguarding democratic processes and public safety, as they aim to mitigate the risks associated with misinformation and manipulation in political discourse.",
