  "summary": "The concept of \"real estate undertaking,\" classified under the ISIC nomenclature, is redirected to the preferred term \"real estate business.\" This term pertains to firms engaged in the economic activities of buying, selling, and managing properties. In the EU regulatory context, these businesses must comply with formal qualifications and certifications, ensuring that employees possess the necessary diplomas and skills. The liberalised market allows for branches to operate across member states, fostering freedom of establishment. However, safeguards exist to prevent discriminatory practices in employment and residence. The attainment of professional recognition is crucial for individuals involved in this sector, simplifying their integration into the market.",
