  "summary": "The concept of \"legality\" within the EU legal framework refers to the adherence to laws and regulations established by the European Union and its member states. It encompasses the principles of rule of law, ensuring that actions taken by authorities are grounded in law and respect fundamental rights. Legality is crucial for maintaining democratic governance and accountability, as it provides a basis for judicial review and enforcement of legal norms. In regulatory contexts, legality ensures that policies and decisions are made transparently and in accordance with established legal procedures, thereby fostering trust in EU institutions and their compliance with both national and supranational legal standards.",
