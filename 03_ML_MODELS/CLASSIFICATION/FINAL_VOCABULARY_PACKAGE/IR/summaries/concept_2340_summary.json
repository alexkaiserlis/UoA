  "summary": "The concept of \"single person\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"one person household\" within the EU's demographic and population category. In legal and regulatory contexts, \"one person household\" refers to living arrangements where an individual resides alone, impacting various aspects of social policy, economic analysis, and demographic statistics. This classification is crucial for understanding population dynamics, resource allocation, and the formulation of targeted social programs. The EU utilizes this concept to inform policies that address the needs of individuals living alone, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of social welfare initiatives and demographic research.",
