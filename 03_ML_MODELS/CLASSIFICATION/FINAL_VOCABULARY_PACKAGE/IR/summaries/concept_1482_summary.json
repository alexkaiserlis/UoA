  "summary": "Simultaneous interpreting is a critical process in EU legal and regulatory contexts, facilitating real-time communication across multiple languages during meetings, conferences, and legal proceedings. This method allows interpreters to convey messages instantaneously, ensuring that all participants can engage fully, regardless of their linguistic background. As a redirect to the preferred term \"interpreting,\" simultaneous interpreting underscores the importance of effective information processing in multilingual environments. This practice is vital for maintaining clarity and accuracy in legal discourse, thereby upholding the principles of transparency and inclusivity within EU institutions.",
