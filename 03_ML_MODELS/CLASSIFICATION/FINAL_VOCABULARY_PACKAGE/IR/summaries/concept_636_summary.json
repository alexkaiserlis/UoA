  "summary": "Intensive farming, categorized under the cultivation of agricultural land, refers to agricultural practices that maximize yield through high input of labor, capital, and technology. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, intensive farming is often scrutinized due to its implications for sustainability, biodiversity, and environmental protection. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) encourages practices that balance productivity with ecological considerations. Regulatory measures may address issues such as soil degradation, water usage, and pesticide application, aiming to mitigate the adverse effects associated with intensive farming while promoting food security within the EU.",
