  "summary": "The \"delegation of signature,\" often redirected to \"delegation of power,\" is a critical concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, enabling decentralized governance. This mechanism allows designated authorities to act on behalf of higher entities, thereby streamlining decision-making processes. For instance, in the context of the CARIFORUM agreement, it assists in the management of trade relations with countries like Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, and Barbados. The overarching principle is to ensure that the delegated powers are exercised within established legal atmospheres, maintaining compliance with EU regulations. This delegation can encompass various sectors, including the regulation of pyrotechnic materials and the oversight of sweetened jellies and jams. By facilitating such delegation, the EU enhances its regulatory efficiency, ensuring that even complex matters, such as those involving cetaceans or explosive substances, are managed effectively across member states.",
