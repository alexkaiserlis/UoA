  "summary": "The concept of \"home help\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to social protection measures aimed at assisting individuals, particularly the elderly and disabled, in their daily activities. This support is essential for promoting autonomy and enhancing quality of life. Home help services may include personal care, household assistance, and companionship, thereby addressing the diverse needs of vulnerable populations. The EU encourages member states to develop comprehensive policies that ensure accessibility and quality of home help services, thereby fostering social inclusion and improving overall welfare. Such initiatives align with broader objectives of social protection and human rights within the EU context.",
