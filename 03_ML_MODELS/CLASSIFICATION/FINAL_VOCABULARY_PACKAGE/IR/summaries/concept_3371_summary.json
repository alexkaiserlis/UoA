  "summary": "Public hygiene, as defined within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, encompasses a range of measures aimed at ensuring health and safety standards across member states. This concept involves the accreditation of facilities and practices that govern public health, thereby alleviating burdens on healthcare systems. The European Central Bank (ECB) may delegate authority to relevant bodies for the timely processing of requests related to public hygiene. Statutes governing public hygiene include provisions for the renewal and revocation of accreditations, ensuring compliance with safety standards. Decisions made by governing boards can grant exemptions or suspend operations that do not meet established procedures, thereby protecting public health.",
