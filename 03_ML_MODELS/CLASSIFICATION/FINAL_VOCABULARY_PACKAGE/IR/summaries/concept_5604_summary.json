  "summary": "\"Workers' stock ownership\" refers to a legal framework allowing employees to acquire shares in their employing company, thereby fostering a sense of ownership and engagement in corporate governance. Within the EU, this concept is integral to labour law and labour relations, promoting employee participation in decision-making processes and aligning their interests with those of shareholders. Regulatory measures may include tax incentives and mechanisms to ensure equitable access to stock ownership plans. By enhancing employee motivation and productivity, workers' stock ownership contributes to a more collaborative workplace environment, ultimately benefiting both the workforce and the overall economy.",
