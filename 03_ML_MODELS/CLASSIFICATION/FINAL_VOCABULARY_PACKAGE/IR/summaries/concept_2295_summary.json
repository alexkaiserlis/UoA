  "summary": "The concept of \"developing countries\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks addresses the formidable economic conditions faced by these nations. The EU's approach includes implementing strategies for sensitization and reinclude marginalized populations in global discussions. Key imperatives involve addressing unmet needs such as healthcare, where issues like malaria and infanticide are prevalent. The EU pledges to support initiatives that redress these tragedies, including disbursing funds for contraception and education. Furthermore, the focus on industrialized nations coexisting with developing counterparts aims to translate economic growth into a multiplier effect, fostering sustainable development. This triennial commitment underscores the EU's dedication to supporting these regions through comprehensive policies.",
