  "summary": "The concept of \"retroactivity of a law\" refers to the legal principle whereby a new law is applied to events or situations that occurred before its enactment. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, retroactivity is generally disfavored, as it can undermine the principles of legal certainty and the protection of legitimate expectations. However, exceptions may exist, particularly in areas like criminal law or where expressly stated in the legislation. The EU's approach emphasizes the need for clarity and predictability in legal norms, ensuring that individuals and entities are not adversely affected by unforeseen changes in the law.",
