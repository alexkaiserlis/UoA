  "summary": "\"Fuel enrichment\" refers to the process of increasing the proportion of fissile isotopes in nuclear fuel, primarily uranium, to enhance its efficiency in nuclear reactors. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, fuel enrichment is subject to stringent oversight to ensure compliance with safety standards and non-proliferation treaties. The European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) establishes regulations governing the enrichment processes, aiming to prevent the diversion of materials for illicit purposes. Additionally, the EU promotes research and development in advanced enrichment technologies, balancing energy needs with environmental considerations and international obligations.",
