  "summary": "Transport law within the EU framework encompasses a range of regulations governing the movement of goods and individuals across various modalities, including road, rail, and waterways. This legal domain aims to enforce competition principles, ensuring that dominant undertakings do not abuse their power or infringe upon the rights of other operators. It specifies sanctions and penalties for violations, including fines for discriminatory practices. The enforcement of transport law involves periodic investigations into compliance and the imposition of restrictions to maintain fair competition. Future developments in transport law may introduce new practices to enhance certainty and efficiency in the sector, while also addressing events that may interrupt services.",
