  "summary": "International adoption refers to the legal process whereby individuals or couples from one country adopt a child from another country, establishing a permanent parent-child relationship across national borders. Within the EU legal framework, international adoption is governed by various regulations and directives aimed at ensuring the welfare of the child and the rights of the adoptive parents. The EU promotes cooperation among member states to facilitate safe and ethical adoption practices, adhering to the principles outlined in the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. This regulatory oversight aims to prevent child trafficking and ensure that all adoptions are conducted in the best interests of the child.",
