  "summary": "The \"Mariana Islands\" refer to a chain of islands in the Pacific, associated with the United States, which includes Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, these territories are relevant for health and animal movement regulations, particularly concerning the risk of spreading diseases such as rabies. The EU maintains lists of species and animals that may pose a higher health risk upon entry from non-EU countries, including those in the Mariana Islands. Compliance checks and additional regulations apply to commercial movements of pets and food products from these territories to ensure public health safety within the EEA.",
