  "summary": "The concept of \"publication of transport tariffs\" pertains to the regulatory framework governing the transparency and accessibility of pricing information within the transport sector in the European Union. This concept, which redirects to the preferred term \"publication of tariffs,\" emphasizes the necessity for transport service providers to disclose their tariffs to ensure fair competition and consumer protection. By mandating the publication of tariffs, the EU aims to facilitate informed decision-making among consumers and promote market efficiency. This regulatory requirement aligns with broader transport policy objectives, enhancing the overall integrity and functionality of the EU transport market.",
