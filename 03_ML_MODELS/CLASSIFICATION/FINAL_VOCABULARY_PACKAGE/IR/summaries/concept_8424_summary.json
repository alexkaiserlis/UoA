  "summary": "Representative democracy is a foundational principle within the European Union's political framework, emphasizing the role of elected officials in representing the electorate's interests. This system facilitates citizen participation in governance through periodic elections, ensuring that decision-making reflects the will of the populace. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, representative democracy underpins the legitimacy of institutions such as the European Parliament, which is directly elected by EU citizens. This democratic model promotes accountability and transparency, essential for fostering trust in EU governance and enhancing the overall efficacy of its regulatory mechanisms.",
