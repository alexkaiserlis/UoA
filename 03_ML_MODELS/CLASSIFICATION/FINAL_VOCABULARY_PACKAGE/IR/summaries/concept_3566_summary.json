  "summary": "Professional ethics within the context of EU labour law and labour relations encompasses the principles that govern the conduct of professionals, ensuring objectivity and accountability in their engagements. These ethical standards are crucial for maintaining reputational integrity and fostering trust among stakeholders. Regulatory frameworks often scrutinise compliance with these ethics, particularly in sectors like auditing, where the reliance on accurate financial reporting is paramount. Additionally, the interoperation of various national codes of ethics, such as those from jurisdictions like Guernsey, Jersey, and the Cayman Islands, highlights the need for a cohesive approach. The EU's commitment to ethical governance is reflected in its enacting regulations that address the responsibilities of professionals, thereby promoting a culture of ethical behaviour across member states.",
