  "summary": "\"Soft power\" refers to the ability of a state or entity to influence others through attraction and persuasion rather than coercion or force. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, soft power is significant as it shapes diplomatic relations and cultural exchanges among member states and external partners. The EU employs soft power strategies to promote its values, such as democracy and human rights, thereby enhancing its global standing. This concept is integral to the EU's foreign policy framework, where legal instruments and regulatory measures are designed to foster cooperation and mutual understanding, ultimately contributing to a stable international order.",
