  "summary": "The concept of \"wages for housework\" pertains to the recognition and remuneration of domestic labor, particularly in the context of EU legal frameworks aimed at promoting decent living standards for workers. This issue encompasses various aspects of personnel management and staff remuneration, highlighting the need for systematic efforts to protect domestic workers, including migrants and asylum seekers. The European Union's acquis includes conventions ratified by member states that address discrimination and exclusion in labor markets. By authorising timely measures to ensure fair wages, the EU targets poverty reduction and promotes freedom of choice for workers, while fostering cooperation among jurisdictions to define and share best practices in this domain.",
