  "summary": "Therapeutic abortion refers to the termination of pregnancy for medical reasons, often to safeguard the health or life of the pregnant individual. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, therapeutic abortion is subject to varying national laws, reflecting diverse ethical, cultural, and legal perspectives across member states. The EU does not have a unified directive on therapeutic abortion; rather, it emphasizes the importance of reproductive rights and health as part of broader gender equality initiatives. Legal provisions surrounding therapeutic abortion often involve complex considerations of maternal health, fetal viability, and individual autonomy, necessitating careful regulatory oversight.",
