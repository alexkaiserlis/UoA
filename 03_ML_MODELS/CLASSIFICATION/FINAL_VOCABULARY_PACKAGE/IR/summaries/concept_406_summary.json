  "summary": "The term \"deportee\" refers to an individual who has been forcibly removed from a country, typically due to legal or regulatory violations. In the context of EU legal frameworks, deportation is often associated with international security measures aimed at managing migration and ensuring compliance with asylum policies. The EU has established various directives and regulations governing the deportation process, including safeguards to protect the rights of deportees. These legal instruments aim to balance national security interests with humanitarian considerations, ensuring that deportation procedures adhere to international human rights standards. The concept is integral to discussions surrounding migration control and border management within the EU.",
