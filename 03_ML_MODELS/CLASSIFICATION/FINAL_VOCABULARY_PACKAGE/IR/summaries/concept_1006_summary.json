  "summary": "Compensatory financing within the EU trade policy framework addresses the financial measures taken to cover damages occasioned by abnormal circumstances, such as war or hostilities. This mechanism is particularly relevant for consignors of perishable goods, like tuna and refrigerated products, facing sudden disruptions in routes or destinations. The financing aims to mitigate disadvantages and irregularities that may arise from unforeseen events, ensuring that affected parties are not penalized for circumstances beyond their control. By expeditiously providing admissible support, the EU seeks to maintain normality in trade flows, facilitating the recovery of impacted sectors, such as those in Madeira and Guyana.",
