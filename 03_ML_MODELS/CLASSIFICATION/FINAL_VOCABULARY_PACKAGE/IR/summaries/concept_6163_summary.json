  "summary": "The \"World Organisation for Animal Health\" (OIE) is a pivotal global entity that ensures the welfare of animals and the health of aquatic and terrestrial species. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the OIE plays a crucial role in disseminating information on diseases, thereby assisting member states in fulfilling their obligations to certify animal health standards. The EU's commitment to veterinary education and training is enhanced through OIE's conferences and proceedings, which elaborate on best practices. By joining the OIE, countries like the Maldives and those in the ROM region benefit from shared resources and expertise, thus enhancing their capacity to combat diseases and promote aquaculture.",
