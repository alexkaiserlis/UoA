  "summary": "The concept of \"social behaviour\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the patterns of interaction among individuals and groups that influence social cohesion and welfare. It encompasses various aspects of social policy, including the promotion of inclusivity, the prevention of discrimination, and the enhancement of community engagement. EU regulations often address social behaviour through directives aimed at fostering equality and social justice, thereby ensuring that member states uphold fundamental rights. Understanding social behaviour is crucial for developing effective policies that address social challenges and promote the well-being of citizens across the Union.",
