  "summary": "The concept of \"low rent\" pertains to the regulatory framework governing affordable housing within the EU's construction and town planning sector. It signifies housing options that are economically accessible to low-income individuals and families, ensuring compliance with EU directives aimed at promoting social inclusion and equitable urban development. The establishment of low rent schemes is crucial for mitigating housing shortages and fostering sustainable communities.
