  "summary": "The concept of \"suspension of imports,\" redirected to \"import restriction,\" pertains to EU regulatory measures aimed at controlling the influx of goods into the internal market. Such restrictions may arise suddenly, often in response to health crises, as seen with diseases like *vulnificus* or *staphylococcus aureus*, which can exacerbate public health concerns. Protocoles governing these measures ensure that imports, including beefmeat and other fibrous products, are routed through rigorous checks. The legal framework necessitates a review by relevant committees, which may include assessments of nonviscerated goods or those from regions like Ceará and Piauí. These import restrictions are essential for maintaining unbroken supply chains while safeguarding EU citizens from potential threats posed by exotic species, such as *trachemys scripta* and *rana catesbeiana*, and other invasive organisms.",
