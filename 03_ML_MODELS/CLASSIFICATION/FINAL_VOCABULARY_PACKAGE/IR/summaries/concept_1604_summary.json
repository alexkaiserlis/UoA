  "summary": "The Eurovoc concept \"spinach,\" categorized under plant products, redirects to the preferred term \"leaf vegetable.\" In EU legal and regulatory contexts, spinach encompasses various cultivars, including cichorium and endivia, which contribute to the diversity of leafy greens. Regulations governing the cleanness and quality of these products ensure that varieties such as curly, ribbed, and lactuca meet safety standards. The administration of these regulations is crucial for maintaining the integrity of products like insalata and rucola in markets. Additionally, the cultivation of spinach in regions like Dithmarscher and Reichenau highlights the importance of sunlight and soil characteristics, impacting growth and turgescence. Ensuring compliance with these standards supports the continuous supply of fresh vegetables, including fenland varieties and those used in dishes like choucroute and garnie.",
