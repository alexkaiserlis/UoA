  "summary": "Corporate finance within the EU legal and regulatory framework encompasses the structures and statutes governing financial undertakings. It stands as a crucial phase in enabling businesses to secure optimum funding while ensuring compliance with supervisory authorities. Initially, corporate finance involves the preparation of financial instruments that can cover several aspects of investment. Over time, these processes may cease to be effective if they do not adapt to evolving market conditions. The regulatory environment aims to correct ambiguous practices and erroneous interpretations, gradually extending the scope of corporate finance to include joint ventures and collaborative investments. This inclusive approach is intended to support sustainable economic growth across member states.",
