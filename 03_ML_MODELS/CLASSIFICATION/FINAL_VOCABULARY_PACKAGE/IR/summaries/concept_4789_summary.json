  "summary": "A \"free-trade area\" (FTA) is a pivotal concept in EU tariff policy, facilitating the elimination of tariffs between partner countries to enhance trade predictability and economic integration. The DCFTA (Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area) exemplifies this, particularly with Eastern European neighbours like Ukraine, aiming to promote democracy and sovereignty through closer economic ties. FTAs face challenges such as the proliferation of tariffs and the need for unanimous assent from member states. The urgency of aligning schedules and preferences is critical, especially in times of geopolitical tension. As such, FTAs are instrumental in countering threats to territorial integrity and fostering independent democratic parliaments.",
