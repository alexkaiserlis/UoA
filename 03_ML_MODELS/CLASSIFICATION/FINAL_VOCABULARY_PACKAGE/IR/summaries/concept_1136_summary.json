  "summary": "The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is a multilateral treaty aimed at establishing a framework for international trade negotiations and reducing tariffs. Within EU legal and regulatory contexts, GATT plays a crucial role in shaping trade policies and practices, influencing negotiations on various goods, including poultrymet and sisal. Its principles have been instrumental in unbinding trade barriers, thus facilitating smoother transitions in trade relations. The agreement has faced criticisms regarding its effectiveness in addressing issues like unlicensed smallware and counterclaims. As the EU navigates complex trade dynamics, GATT remains a foundational element, underpinning the communautăšenne approach to trade governance.",
