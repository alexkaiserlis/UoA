  "summary": "The concept of \"budgetary discharge\" refers to the formal approval process by which the European Parliament grants discharge to the European Commission for the execution of the EU budget. This procedure is crucial for ensuring accountability and transparency in the management of public funds. Following the annual budgetary cycle, the Parliament assesses the Commission's financial management and compliance with regulations. Upon satisfactory evaluation, the Parliament issues a discharge, thereby releasing the Commission from liability for the budgetary execution. This process underscores the principles of financial oversight and democratic control within the EU's regulatory framework, reinforcing the integrity of budgetary governance.",
