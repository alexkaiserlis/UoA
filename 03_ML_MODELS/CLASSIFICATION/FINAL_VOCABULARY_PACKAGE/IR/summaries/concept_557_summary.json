  "summary": "Workers' rights, as encapsulated under the broader concept of \"labour law,\" are pivotal in EU regulatory frameworks, ensuring dignified employment conditions. This legal domain interlinks various aspects, including the rights of transferors and transferees during employment transitions, such as secondment. The EU promotes fairer bargaining practices, supporting workers' enjoyment of their rights, irrespective of race, creed, or religious beliefs. Activists and leaders strive for adaptability in labour laws to address issues like insolvency and bankruptcies. The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) advocate for decent working conditions, illustrating the necessity of robust legal protections for all workers, including seafarers.",
