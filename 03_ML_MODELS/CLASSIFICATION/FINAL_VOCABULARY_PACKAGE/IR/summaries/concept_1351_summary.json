  "summary": "The \"divergence indicator\" is a regulatory concept within the EU's monetary relations framework, serving as a metric to assess the degree of variation in economic performance among member states. This indicator is crucial for monitoring compliance with the convergence criteria established by the Maastricht Treaty, which aims to ensure economic stability and integration within the Eurozone. By evaluating divergence, policymakers can identify potential risks to monetary cohesion and implement necessary measures to address disparities. The divergence indicator thus plays a pivotal role in shaping fiscal policies and fostering economic alignment across the EU, ensuring that member states adhere to collective monetary objectives.",
