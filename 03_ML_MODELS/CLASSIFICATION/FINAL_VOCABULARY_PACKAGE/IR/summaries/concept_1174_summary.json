  "summary": "The term \"revolutionary government,\" redirected to \"rebel government,\" pertains to political frameworks within the EU's legal context, particularly in relation to conflict resolution and governance. Such governments often emerge in scenarios where constitutional order has been violated, leading to negotiations mediated by credible parties like the SADC or other international mediators. In regions like Madagascar or Comoros, the EU may endorse initiatives aimed at charting a roadmap for peace, despite elapsed moments of instability. Sanctions may be imposed on illegal regimes, while the EU's CFSP seeks to facilitate substantive negotiations that envision a return to democratic elections, fostering consensus among conflicting parties.",
