  "summary": "The concept of \"women's military service\" pertains to the integration and participation of women in armed forces within the context of EU defence policy. This concept addresses legal frameworks and regulatory measures aimed at promoting gender equality in military roles, ensuring that women have equal opportunities for recruitment, training, and advancement. The EU has increasingly recognized the importance of diversity in defence sectors, advocating for policies that dismantle barriers to women's full participation. This aligns with broader EU objectives of fostering inclusivity and enhancing operational effectiveness within military structures, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive approach to security and defence.",
