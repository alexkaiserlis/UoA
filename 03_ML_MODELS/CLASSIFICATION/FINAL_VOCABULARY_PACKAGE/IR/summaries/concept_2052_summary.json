  "summary": "The concept of \"Nepal\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework primarily relates to economic geography, particularly in the context of trade agreements and development initiatives. Nepalese textiles, notably garments, are significant under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), which aims to foster trade relations with developing countries. The EU's engagement with Nepal is reflected in its participation in the SAARC and ASEAN dialogues, promoting reciprocal trade benefits. The prolonged debate surrounding trade closures and the ability to absorb competition demonstrates the EU's commitment to addressing poverty and unemployment in Nepal. The initialled agreements confirm a simpler regulatory framework, facilitating cumulation of trade benefits and supporting sustainable development in the region.",
