  "summary": "\"Structural funds expenditure,\" also referred to as \"structural expenditure,\" encompasses the allocations of EU financial resources aimed at promoting cohesion and convergence among member states. This expenditure is measured against GDP and is crucial for addressing territorial disparities. It includes funding from various sources, such as the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF). The programming of these funds specifies eligibility criteria and ceilings for spending, ensuring that appropriations are effectively transferred to eligible units. The net figures for structural expenditure are calculated to enhance domestic growth, while maintaining voluntary thresholds for rural development initiatives.",
