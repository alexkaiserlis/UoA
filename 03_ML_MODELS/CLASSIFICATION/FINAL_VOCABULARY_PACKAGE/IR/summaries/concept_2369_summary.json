  "summary": "The concept of \"philosophy\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory documents encompasses the foundational principles and ethical considerations that underpin the development and interpretation of laws. It serves as a critical framework for understanding human rights, justice, and governance within the European Union. Philosophy informs the rationale behind legislative measures and policy-making, guiding the EU's commitment to values such as democracy, rule of law, and respect for fundamental rights. By integrating philosophical discourse into legal analysis, EU institutions can better navigate complex regulatory landscapes and address the moral implications of their decisions, thereby fostering a more cohesive and principled legal order.",
