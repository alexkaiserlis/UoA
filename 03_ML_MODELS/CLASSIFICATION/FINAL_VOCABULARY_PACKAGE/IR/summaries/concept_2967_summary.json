  "summary": "\"Community preference\" refers to a principle within EU trade policy that prioritizes the interests of EU member states in the allocation of resources and trade opportunities. This concept is integral to the EU's regulatory framework, as it aims to enhance intra-community trade by favoring products and services originating from member states over those from non-EU countries. By establishing a preferential treatment system, the EU seeks to bolster economic cohesion and support local industries. This principle is often reflected in various trade agreements and regulatory measures, ensuring that community interests are safeguarded in the context of global trade dynamics.",
