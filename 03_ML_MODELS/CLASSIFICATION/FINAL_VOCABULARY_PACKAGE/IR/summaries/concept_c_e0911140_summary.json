  "summary": "Urban access regulation refers to the legal frameworks established within the European Union to manage and control vehicle access to urban areas. These regulations aim to enhance urban mobility, reduce traffic congestion, and improve air quality by imposing restrictions on certain vehicles, particularly those that are high-emission or non-compliant with environmental standards. Urban access regulation is integral to transport policy, aligning with broader EU objectives of sustainable development and public health. By implementing these regulations, EU member states can promote the use of public transport and non-motorized mobility, fostering more livable urban environments.",
