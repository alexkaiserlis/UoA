  "summary": "A \"trade treaty,\" often redirected to the preferred term \"trade agreement,\" encompasses legal frameworks governing international trade relations between parties, including plurilateral agreements. Within the EU context, these treaties facilitate the exchange of services and goods, addressing issues such as tariffs and market access. Notably, they can also involve provisions for dispute resolution, where an umpire may be appointed to resolve conflicts. Trade agreements aim to promote friendship and economic cooperation, while also addressing protests from communities affected by trade policies. The indivisibility of trade and regulatory measures ensures that agreements are comprehensive, balancing interests of various stakeholders, including exhibitors and organizers at trade congresses.",
