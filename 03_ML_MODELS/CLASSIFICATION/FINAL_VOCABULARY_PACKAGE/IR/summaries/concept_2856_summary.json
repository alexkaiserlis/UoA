  "summary": "The concept of \"social psychology,\" while a redirect to the preferred term \"psychology,\" plays an essential role in EU legal and regulatory frameworks. It emerged as a critical discipline influencing various policies, particularly in health and social cooperation. Ministers have stressed the importance of integrating psychological factors into multiannual programmes aimed at supporting social cohesion across regions. Guidelines for action encourage compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, ensuring that local contexts are considered. Evaluations of these activities are crucial for extending support and avoiding interruptions in essential services. The EU continues to combat social issues by prioritizing psychological insights in its resolutions and communications, thereby fostering a healthier Europe.",
