  "summary": "The concept of \"international tariff\" within the EU transport policy framework refers to the regulatory mechanisms governing the pricing of transport services across national borders. These tariffs are crucial for ensuring fair competition and transparency in international transport markets. The EU establishes guidelines to harmonize these tariffs, facilitating trade and movement while preventing discriminatory practices. By regulating international tariffs, the EU aims to enhance connectivity and efficiency in transport networks, thereby supporting economic integration. Compliance with these regulations is essential for operators engaged in cross-border transport, ensuring adherence to both EU law and international agreements.",
