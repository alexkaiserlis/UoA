  "summary": "The concept of \"responsibility of an administration,\" redirected to \"administrative responsibility,\" pertains to the accountability mechanisms governing public authorities within the EU framework. This principle underscores the obligation of administrative bodies to act in accordance with legal norms and to be held liable for any failure to comply with these standards. Administrative responsibility ensures transparency and fosters trust in public service by mandating that administrations rectify any maladministration and provide remedies for affected individuals. This legal construct is essential for upholding the rule of law and ensuring that executive power operates within the confines of established regulatory frameworks.",
