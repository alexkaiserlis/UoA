  "summary": "The \"harmonisation of weapons\" refers to the process of aligning national regulations and standards concerning arms and munitions within the European Union. This concept is crucial for ensuring a cohesive defence policy, facilitating the free movement of military goods, and enhancing interoperability among member states' armed forces. The harmonisation aims to mitigate discrepancies in national legislation, thereby promoting safety and security across the EU. As a redirect to the preferred term \"harmonisation of weapons,\" it underscores the importance of unified regulatory frameworks in the defence sector, which is essential for effective collaboration and strategic partnerships among EU countries.",
