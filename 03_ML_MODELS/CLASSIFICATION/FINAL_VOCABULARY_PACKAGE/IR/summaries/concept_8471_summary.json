  "summary": "Sustainable tourism, often referred to as ecological tourism, is a concept increasingly emphasized in EU legal and regulatory frameworks aimed at promoting environmentally responsible travel practices. This approach seeks to minimize the ecological footprint of tourism activities while enhancing the socio-economic benefits for local communities. The EU has implemented various directives and initiatives to support sustainable tourism, encouraging member states to adopt policies that foster conservation and sustainable development. By redirecting focus to ecological tourism, the EU aims to ensure that tourism contributes positively to biodiversity preservation and cultural heritage, aligning with broader social affairs objectives within the Union.",
