  "summary": "Deinstitutionalisation refers to the process of transitioning individuals with disabilities or mental health issues from institutional settings to community-based environments. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, deinstitutionalisation is aligned with the principles of social protection and human rights, emphasizing the need for inclusive policies that promote autonomy and social integration. The EU supports deinstitutionalisation through various directives and funding programs, aiming to enhance the quality of life for affected individuals. This approach is crucial for ensuring compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, fostering a paradigm shift towards community living and support.",
