  "summary": "The concept of \"rosé wine\" falls under the category of beverages and sugar within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Rosé wine, characterized by its pink hue, is produced through specific vinification techniques that involve limited skin contact with red grape varieties. The European Union regulates the production, labeling, and marketing of rosé wine to ensure quality standards and protect consumer interests. This includes adherence to geographical indications (GIs) and quality designations, which safeguard the authenticity of regional products. Compliance with these regulations is essential for producers to maintain market access and uphold the integrity of the EU's wine sector.",
