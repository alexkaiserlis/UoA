  "summary": "The Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) is a pivotal forum established under the Marrakesh Agreement, functioning within the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework. It plays a crucial role in resolving disputes by codifying rules and ensuring expeditious rulings that underline the importance of rationality and sustainability in international trade. The DSB's procedures are designed to conserve resources and broaden the ecosystem of trade relations, permitting diverse interpretations of agreements. By addressing issues such as dumping and subsidies, the DSB contributes to the modernisation of trade practices, fulfilling the precautionary principle and ensuring optimum utilisation of marine resources, particularly in the context of the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC).",
