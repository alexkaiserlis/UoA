  "summary": "A \"mixed farm\" refers to an agricultural system that integrates both crop cultivation and livestock production within the same operational framework. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, mixed farms are significant for their contribution to sustainable farming practices and biodiversity. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) encourages mixed farming as a means to enhance environmental stewardship and promote rural development. By diversifying production, mixed farms can improve resilience against market fluctuations and climate change impacts. Regulatory frameworks often provide guidelines and support mechanisms to facilitate the transition towards mixed farming systems, thereby aligning agricultural practices with EU sustainability goals.",
