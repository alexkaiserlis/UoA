  "summary": "In the context of EU trade regulations, \"self-supply\" refers to the practice where establishments, particularly in remote or coastal regions, produce and distribute goods, such as processed fishery products, primarily for local consumption. This concept plays a vital role in ensuring that small producers can meet stringent health and safety standards while avoiding market distortions. By identifying and reserving specific areas for self-supply, the EU aims to support local economies, especially in islands and less accessible regions. Such measures help maintain a minimum volume of production, ensuring that local markets are supplied without excessive constraints, thus enhancing competition and sustainability in the sector.",
