  "summary": "The concept of \"secret society\" pertains to clandestine organizations that operate outside the purview of public scrutiny, often raising concerns within the framework of EU legal and regulatory affairs. Such societies may engage in activities that challenge transparency and accountability, fundamental principles enshrined in EU law. The existence of secret societies can complicate social cohesion and undermine democratic processes, necessitating regulatory oversight. While the EU does not explicitly legislate against secret societies, their potential influence on social affairs and governance prompts discussions about the balance between individual freedoms and the collective interest, highlighting the need for vigilance in safeguarding democratic integrity.",
