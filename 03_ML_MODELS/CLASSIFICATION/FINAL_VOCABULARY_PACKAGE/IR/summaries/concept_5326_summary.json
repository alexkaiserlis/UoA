  "summary": "The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a pivotal international treaty established to safeguard human rights and fundamental freedoms across Europe. It serves as a cornerstone of the legal framework within the Council of Europe, influencing EU law and regulatory practices. The ECHR obliges signatory states to uphold various rights, including the right to a fair trial and freedom from torture. Its enforcement mechanism, the European Court of Human Rights, adjudicates violations, thereby ensuring compliance and promoting accountability. The Convention's principles are integral to the EU's commitment to human dignity, democracy, and the rule of law, reinforcing its legal obligations within member states.",
