  "summary": "Standardisation, as a pivotal concept in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, encompasses the development of cohesive technical regulations that integrate diverse sectors, including technology and healthcare. It facilitates the creation of common vocabulary and technicality across member states, ensuring that products, such as chlorosilanes and silicones, meet safety and performance standards. This process involves the coordination of various stakeholders, including industry representatives and regulatory bodies, to address issues like recyclability and interoperability. By referencing established standards, the EU promotes cohesive market practices, enhancing consumer protection and fostering innovation in areas like surgery and anatomic implants, while also addressing challenges such as submergence and volumetric accuracy in technical applications.",
