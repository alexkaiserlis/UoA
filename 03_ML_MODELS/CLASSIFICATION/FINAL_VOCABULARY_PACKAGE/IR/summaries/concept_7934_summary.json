  "summary": "A public-private partnership (PPP) is a collaborative arrangement between public authorities and private entities, aimed at delivering public services or infrastructure projects. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, PPPs are governed by directives that ensure transparency, competition, and accountability. These partnerships leverage private sector expertise and investment to enhance efficiency in public service delivery while mitigating public expenditure. The EU promotes PPPs as a means to achieve strategic objectives, such as sustainable development and innovation, while adhering to principles of good governance. This model is increasingly recognized as a viable solution for addressing public sector challenges across member states.",
