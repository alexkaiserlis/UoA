  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, a \"monograph\" refers to a comprehensive written study or treatise focused on a single subject or aspect of law or regulation. Monographs serve as critical documentation, providing in-depth analysis and interpretation of specific legal issues, principles, or frameworks. They are often utilized by legal scholars, policymakers, and practitioners to elucidate complex regulatory concepts and contribute to the body of knowledge within the EU legal landscape. By consolidating research and insights, monographs facilitate informed decision-making and enhance understanding of pertinent legal matters, thereby supporting effective governance and compliance within the EU.",
