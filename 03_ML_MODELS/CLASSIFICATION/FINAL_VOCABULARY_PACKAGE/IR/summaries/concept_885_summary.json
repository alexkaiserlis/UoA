  "summary": "The concept of \"rule under emergency powers\" pertains to the legal framework that allows EU member states to implement unplanned measures during crises, such as disasters or public safety threats. This framework emphasizes the need for coordinated responses, enabling governments to devise resolutions that adequately address unique situations. The desirability of flexibility in legal responses is stressed, as it allows for advanced telecommunications and organizational capabilities to be utilized effectively. Citizens may face divergent implications, necessitating clear communication through various networks. Emergency powers can ease the burden on infrastructures and ensure that essential services continue to function, thereby safeguarding public safety.",
