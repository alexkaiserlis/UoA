  "summary": "The \"separation of powers\" is a fundamental principle within the EU political framework, ensuring that the legislative, executive, and judicial branches operate independently. This doctrine is pivotal in maintaining checks and balances, preventing the concentration of power and safeguarding democratic governance. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, the separation of powers underpins the functioning of institutions such as the European Parliament, the European Commission, and the Court of Justice of the European Union. By delineating responsibilities and authority, this principle fosters accountability and transparency, crucial for upholding the rule of law within the EU.",
