  "summary": "The concept of \"artistic creation\" encompasses a wide array of creative outputs, including compositions, lyrics, and performances across various genres such as jazz, rock, and opera. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, artistic creation is protected under copyright law, which governs the lawful reproduction and fixation of works. This protection ensures that authors, including composers and librettists, receive royalties for their creations, allowing them to recoup investments in their careers. The law also addresses collaborative works, where rights may be contractually renegotiated. Ultimately, artistic creation fosters a socially vibrant culture, enabling performers to coexist and thrive in a dynamic creative landscape.",
