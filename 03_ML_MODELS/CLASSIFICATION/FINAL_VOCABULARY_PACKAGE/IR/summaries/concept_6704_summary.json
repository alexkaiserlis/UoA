  "summary": "The \"enlargement of an international organisation\" refers to the process by which new members accede to an existing entity, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO). This process is embodied in a series of negotiated protocols that require comprehensive reforms and commitments from both the acceding party and existing members. Meetings and conferences are conducted at regular intervals to discuss the importance of sustainable contributions and to satisfy the expectations of all stakeholders. The EU plays a pivotal role in this process, approving terms that ensure democratic governance and positive outcomes for the people involved, thereby enhancing the organisation's global position and effectiveness.",
