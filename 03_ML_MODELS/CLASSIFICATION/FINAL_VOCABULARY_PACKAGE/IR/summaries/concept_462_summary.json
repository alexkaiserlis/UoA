  "summary": "The concept of \"regional imbalance,\" redirected to \"regional disparity,\" pertains to the uneven distribution of resources and opportunities across EU regions. This disparity is often exacerbated by factors such as topography, remoteness, and insularity, particularly affecting marginalised areas like the outermost regions, including Madeira and the Azores. EU regulations, such as those under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), obligate member states to implement interventions that support the diversification and development of deprived regions. By acknowledging these disparities, the EU aims to simplify the redistribution of resources, ensuring that housing, infrastructure, and economic activities are more equitably structured, thereby enhancing overall regional cohesion.",
