  "summary": "The concept of \"labour policy,\" redirected to \"employment policy,\" encompasses various EU legal frameworks aimed at reforming and formalising the workings of employment across member states. This policy is characterized by a tripartite approach, involving confederations like ETUC and business associations such as UNICE. It emphasizes the need for anticipatory measures and counselling to enhance abilities and legitimacy in the workforce. The EU's taskforce initiatives, including summits in regions like Extremadura and Asturias, aim to redefine employment strategies, ensuring that all stakeholders, including eurocadres, are actively engaged. The Laeken Declaration affirmed the importance of concertation in achieving effective labour policies, fostering a mentality of collaboration and reforming existing structures to address contemporary challenges.",
