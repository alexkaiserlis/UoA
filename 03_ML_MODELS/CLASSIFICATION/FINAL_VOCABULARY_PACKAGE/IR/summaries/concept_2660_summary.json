  "summary": "The concept of \"cost price\" refers to the fundamental price of a product or service, encompassing all expenses incurred in its production or provision. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, cost price is crucial for establishing fair pricing practices, ensuring transparency in trade, and preventing anti-competitive behavior. Regulatory bodies may utilize cost price calculations to assess compliance with competition law, particularly in sectors where pricing strategies impact market dynamics. Understanding cost price is essential for businesses to navigate EU regulations effectively, as it influences pricing policies, consumer protection measures, and overall market integrity within the European Union.",
