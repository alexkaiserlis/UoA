  "summary": "The term \"scallop,\" categorized under fisheries, is a redirect to the preferred term \"bivalve mollusc.\" In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, bivalve molluscs, including scallops, are subject to specific regulations aimed at sustainable fishing practices and conservation efforts. The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) governs the management of these species, ensuring that fishing activities do not compromise marine biodiversity. Additionally, regulations stipulate the monitoring of stock levels and the implementation of quotas to prevent overfishing. Understanding the legal status of bivalve molluscs is essential for compliance and the promotion of sustainable fisheries within the EU.",
