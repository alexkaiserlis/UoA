It encompasses the assessment of resources, infrastructure, and human capital that can be leveraged to stimulate growth. In the context of EU cohesion policy, identifying areas with significant development potential is crucial for allocating funds and implementing programs aimed at reducing disparities among member states. This concept is integral to fostering sustainable economic development and ensuring that all regions can contribute to the overall prosperity of the European Union.",
