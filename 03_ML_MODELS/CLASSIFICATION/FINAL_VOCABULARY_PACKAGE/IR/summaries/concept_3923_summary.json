  "summary": "\"Administrative science\" is a multidisciplinary field that examines the principles and practices governing public administration within the European Union. It encompasses the study of regulatory frameworks, governance structures, and the implementation of EU policies. This concept is crucial for understanding how administrative procedures are designed to ensure compliance with EU law, enhance transparency, and promote accountability in public institutions. By analyzing the interplay between legal norms and administrative actions, administrative science contributes to the development of effective regulatory mechanisms that facilitate the functioning of the EU's internal market and uphold the rule of law across member states.",
