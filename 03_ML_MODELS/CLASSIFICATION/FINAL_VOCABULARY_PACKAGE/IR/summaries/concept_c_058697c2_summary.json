  "summary": "The concept of \"health determinant\" refers to a range of factors that significantly influence the health status of individuals and populations within the EU. These determinants encompass social, economic, environmental, and behavioral elements that collectively shape health outcomes. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, understanding health determinants is crucial for the formulation of effective public health policies and interventions. The EU emphasizes the need for comprehensive strategies that address these determinants to promote health equity and improve overall well-being. By integrating this concept into legislative measures, the EU aims to foster healthier environments and reduce health disparities across member states.",
