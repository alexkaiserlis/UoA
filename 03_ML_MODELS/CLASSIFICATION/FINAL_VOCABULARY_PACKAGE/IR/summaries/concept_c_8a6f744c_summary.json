  "summary": "The concept of \"withdrawing EU country\" refers to the legal and regulatory framework surrounding a member state's decision to exit the European Union, commonly termed \"withdrawal from the EU.\" This process is governed by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), which outlines the procedural steps for a member state to notify the European Council of its intention to withdraw. The withdrawal entails complex negotiations regarding the terms of departure, including the future relationship between the exiting country and the EU. This concept is critical for understanding the implications of EU membership cessation on legal obligations, trade agreements, and regulatory alignment.",
