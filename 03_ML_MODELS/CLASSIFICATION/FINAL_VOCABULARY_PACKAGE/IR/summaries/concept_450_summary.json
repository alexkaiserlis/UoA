  "summary": "The concept of \"voting discipline\" pertains to the adherence of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to party lines during parliamentary proceedings. This practice is crucial for ensuring cohesion and strategic alignment within political groups, particularly when voting on significant legislative measures. Voting discipline can influence the outcome of votes, as it reflects the collective stance of a political faction. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, maintaining voting discipline is essential for effective governance and the implementation of EU policies, thereby reinforcing the integrity of the legislative process and enhancing democratic accountability within the Union.",
