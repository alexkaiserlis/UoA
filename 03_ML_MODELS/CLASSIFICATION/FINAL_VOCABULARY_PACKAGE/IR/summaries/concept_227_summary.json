  "summary": "A \"workers' cooperative\" is a specific legal form of organisation within the broader category of cooperatives, where workers collectively own and manage the enterprise. In the context of EU regulations, these cooperatives are designed to counterbalance traditional corporate structures by prioritizing worker equity and participation. Members, often referred to as investors in their own labour, vote on key decisions, ensuring that profits are distributed as dividends based on their stake in the cooperative. This model conceivably supports unemployed individuals by providing stable wages and opportunities for investment in local neighbourhoods. Cooperatives can also play a crucial role in catering to societal needs, thereby enhancing community resilience and promoting sustainable economic practices.",
