  "summary": "The Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) is a significant extra-European organisation aimed at fostering economic integration and cooperation among its member states in Latin America. Established in 1980, ALADI promotes trade liberalization, economic collaboration, and the establishment of a common market. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, ALADI's initiatives can influence EU-Latin America relations, particularly in trade agreements and regulatory alignment. The association serves as a platform for dialogue and negotiation, which may intersect with EU policies on external relations and international trade, thereby enhancing mutual understanding and cooperation between the EU and Latin American countries.",
