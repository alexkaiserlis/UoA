  "summary": "The concept of \"main acreage\" pertains to the predominant area of land utilized within farming systems in the European Union. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"main acreage\" is critical for assessing agricultural productivity, land use efficiency, and compliance with environmental standards. It serves as a benchmark for implementing policies related to sustainable farming practices, crop rotation, and biodiversity conservation. Accurate delineation of main acreage is essential for the allocation of subsidies and adherence to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Thus, understanding this concept is vital for stakeholders involved in agricultural planning and regulatory compliance within the EU.",
