  "summary": "The \"witness protection scheme,\" commonly referred to as \"witness protection,\" is a vital legal mechanism within the EU justice framework designed to ensure the safety and security of individuals who provide testimony in criminal proceedings. This scheme aims to protect witnesses from intimidation or retaliation, thereby promoting the integrity of the judicial process. By facilitating the relocation and identity alteration of witnesses, the scheme enhances cooperation among member states in combating serious crime and organized criminal activities. The EU has established guidelines to harmonize witness protection measures, ensuring that all member states uphold the fundamental rights of witnesses while maintaining effective law enforcement.",
