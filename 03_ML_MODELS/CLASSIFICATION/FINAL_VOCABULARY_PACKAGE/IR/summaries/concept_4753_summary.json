  "summary": "The concept of \"vote on a text as a whole\" pertains to parliamentary proceedings within the European Union's legislative framework. This procedure allows Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to express their collective approval or disapproval of a legislative proposal in its entirety, rather than voting on individual amendments. This method streamlines decision-making and enhances efficiency, ensuring that the final text reflects a comprehensive consensus. It is particularly significant in the context of complex legislative acts, where a holistic assessment is crucial for maintaining coherence and integrity in EU law. This practice underscores the collaborative nature of EU governance.",
