  "summary": "The \"legislative period\" refers to the defined timeframe during which a parliamentary body, such as the European Parliament, operates to enact legislation and fulfill its mandate. This period is crucial for the establishment of regulatory frameworks and the formulation of policies that govern EU member states. Each legislative period typically lasts five years, aligning with the electoral cycle of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). During this time, the Parliament engages in deliberations, debates, and voting processes to adopt legislative proposals, thereby influencing the legal landscape of the EU. Understanding the legislative period is essential for comprehending the dynamics of EU governance and legislative efficacy.",
