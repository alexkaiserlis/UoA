  "summary": "The concept of \"territorial collectivities of the French Republic,\" redirected to \"French overseas collectivity,\" encompasses regions such as Wallis and Futuna, Polynesia, New Caledonia, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Mayotte. These collectivities operate under specific statutes that modify their relationship with the mainland, ensuring compliance with EU regulations. They are subject to unique judicial frameworks that may derogate from standard EU law, particularly concerning funding and asset transfers. The EU actively engages in appraising their economic activities, including the fight against money laundering and terrorism. Regulatory reforms aim to modernise their governance, fulfilling core criteria for development while managing penalties and premiums associated with various sectors, including agriculture and professions.",
