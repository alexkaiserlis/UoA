  "summary": "Trade union rights are fundamental entitlements that empower workers to organize, engage in collective bargaining, and advocate for their interests within the framework of labour law and labour relations in the European Union. These rights are enshrined in various EU treaties and directives, which aim to protect the freedom of association and promote social dialogue between employers and employees. The EU recognizes the importance of trade unions in ensuring fair working conditions and equitable treatment in the workplace. Consequently, trade union rights serve as a crucial mechanism for safeguarding workers' interests and fostering a balanced labour market across member states.",
