  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"fiscal year,\" redirected to \"financial year,\" refers to the designated period for budgeting and accounting purposes. This timeframe is crucial for determining expenditure limits and ensuring compliance with financial discipline. The Commission utilizes the financial year to assess the fruition of budgetary allocations, including the management of charities and public funds. It encompasses the planning of bookings and necessitates clear guidelines for technicians involved in financial oversight. The fiscal year is pivotal in evaluating the maturity of financial commitments and ensuring that expenditures do not surpass established limits, thereby maintaining fiscal integrity.",
