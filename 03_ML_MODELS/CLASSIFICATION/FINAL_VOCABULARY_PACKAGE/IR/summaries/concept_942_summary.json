  "summary": "Family farming, as defined within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to agricultural holdings where family members are the primary labour force, supplementing economic activities through traditional methods. This concept is outlined in various articles of EU regulations, which set out standards for the organization and structure of family farms. Data collected through surveys and statistics are essential for assessing the impact of these holdings on rural development. The measures adopted pursuant to EEC regulations in June and December provide a framework for supporting family farming, ensuring that these farms are contained within the broader agricultural community and that their contributions are effectively transcribed into policy outcomes.",
