  "summary": "The concept of \"interactive network\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to a harmonized telecommunications infrastructure that enables seamless interconnection and interoperability among various participants across member states. This network is crucial for creating smooth relations and facilitating the circulation of information, capital, and digital services, particularly in smaller, peripheral regions like the island of Corfu. It strengthens societal cohesion by guaranteeing freedoms and enabling movements across frontiers. The memorandum on telecommunications emphasizes the need for properly sized networks to prevent failure and ensure that all enterprises can access these vital infrastructures, thereby fostering a more integrated and interconnected European society.",
