In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, IDPs are recognized under various cooperation policies that aim to address their protection and assistance needs. The EU collaborates with member states and international organizations to implement measures that ensure the rights and well-being of IDPs. This includes adherence to international humanitarian law and the promotion of durable solutions to their displacement, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding their dignity and access to essential services.",
