  "summary": "The \"standing committee\" in the EU context refers to a collaborative body that delivers expert opinions and recommendations on various regulatory matters, including those related to zootechnics and dietetic products. Chaired by a rapporteur, this committee comprises delegates from member states who express their views on proposed legislation, thereby amplifying the synergy between national interests and EU sovereignty. It plays a crucial role in reforming policies to ensure the safety of ecosystems and public health, addressing threats such as toxicological incidents and microbiological dangers. By finalising votes on legislative proposals, the standing committee helps to maintain an orderly regulatory environment, promoting the accomplishment of EU objectives while considering the interests of stakeholders like fishermen and employers.",
