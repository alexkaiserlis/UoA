Within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept encompasses actions that may violate principles of sovereignty and democratic integrity. The EU has recognized the growing threats posed by information warfare, particularly through disinformation campaigns and cyber operations, prompting the development of policies aimed at enhancing resilience and safeguarding democratic processes. Regulatory measures may include cybersecurity initiatives and collaborative frameworks to counteract the adverse effects of such warfare on member states and their institutions.",
