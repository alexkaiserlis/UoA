In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, common land is significant for promoting sustainable farming systems and ensuring equitable access to natural resources. It is governed by various regulations that aim to balance individual rights with communal interests, fostering biodiversity and environmental stewardship. The management of common land is crucial for rural development policies, as it supports traditional practices while addressing contemporary challenges such as land degradation and climate change.",
