  "summary": "Social medicine is a multidisciplinary field that addresses the social determinants of health and their impact on population health outcomes. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, social medicine plays a crucial role in shaping health policies aimed at reducing health inequalities and promoting equitable access to healthcare services. The European Union recognizes the importance of integrating social medicine principles into public health strategies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of health interventions. By focusing on the interplay between social factors and health, EU regulations can foster a holistic approach to health that encompasses not only clinical care but also social welfare and community support systems.",
