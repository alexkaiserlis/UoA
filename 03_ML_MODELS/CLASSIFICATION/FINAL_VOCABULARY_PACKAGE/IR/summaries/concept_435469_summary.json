  "summary": "Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) refers to a range of processes, distinct from traditional litigation, aimed at resolving disputes without resorting to court proceedings. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, ADR mechanisms, such as mediation and arbitration, are encouraged to enhance access to justice and promote efficient conflict resolution. The EU has established directives, such as the Directive on Alternative Dispute Resolution for Consumer Disputes, to facilitate these processes, ensuring they are fair, transparent, and effective. By prioritizing ADR, the EU seeks to alleviate the burden on judicial systems while providing consumers and businesses with equitable means to resolve conflicts amicably.",
