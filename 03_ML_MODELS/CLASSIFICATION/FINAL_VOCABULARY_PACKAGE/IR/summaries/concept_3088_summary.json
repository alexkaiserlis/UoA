  "summary": "Regionalisation, as a concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the process of decentralizing governance and administrative functions to regional authorities. This approach enhances local decision-making and public service delivery, aligning with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality enshrined in EU treaties. Regionalisation facilitates tailored responses to regional needs, promoting efficiency and accountability in the exercise of executive power. It is essential for the implementation of EU policies at a local level, ensuring that diverse regional contexts are adequately considered. The term \"regionalization\" serves as a redirect to \"regionalisation,\" emphasizing the same concept within different linguistic contexts.",
