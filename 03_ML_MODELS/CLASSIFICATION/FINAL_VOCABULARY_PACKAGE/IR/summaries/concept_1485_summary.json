  "summary": "The concept of \"financial intervention\" within the EU legal framework encompasses measures aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability and addressing imbalances in the financial system. This includes actions by counterparty clearing houses (CCPs) and financial institutions to manage exposures and enhance liquidity. Financial interventions may involve disbursing funds through mechanisms like the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), which provide collateralized refinancing to diverse stakeholders. Guidelines for these interventions prioritize prudential measures, ensuring that industrials and financials maintain robust benchmarks across various maturities and indices, thereby safeguarding the Eurosystem's integrity and promoting a stable economic environment.",
