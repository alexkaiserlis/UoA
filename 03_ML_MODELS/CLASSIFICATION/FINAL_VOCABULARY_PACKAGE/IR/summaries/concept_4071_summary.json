  "summary": "The concept of \"competition\" within the EU legal framework encompasses various regulatory mechanisms designed to ensure fair practices among member states and institutions. It involves the recruitment of officials and staff, empowering them to uphold competition laws and oversee compliance. The European Commission, through its competition bureau, forecasts impending challenges and prepares for forthcoming competitions that may affect member states like Slovakia, Estonia, and Malta. Officials are tasked with delivering justice and ensuring contracts are upheld, while auditors assess compliance. This regulatory environment is crucial for maintaining a level playing field across the EU, particularly in light of planned expansions and acceding nations.",
