  "summary": "The concept of \"inclusion in the budget\" pertains to the structured allocation of financial resources within the EU's budgetary framework. It involves conducting surveys to assess the funding needs of various institutions, ensuring that expenses are reimbursed appropriately. The budgetary envelope lays out the maximum contributions required from member states, including those from Slovakia, Estonia, and Malta, among others. This process is essential for maintaining sound financial discipline and adapting to the enlargement of the EU. The inclusion of specific expenditures is crucial for improving the overall structure of budgetary allocations, thereby meeting the annual requirements of the organisation and supporting accession efforts for countries like Romania and Bulgaria.",
