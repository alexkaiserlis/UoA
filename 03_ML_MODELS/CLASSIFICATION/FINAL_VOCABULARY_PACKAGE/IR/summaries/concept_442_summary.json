  "summary": "The concept of \"dissemination of culture,\" redirected to \"cultural transmission,\" encompasses the mechanisms through which cultural values, practices, and knowledge are shared within and across societies. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is vital for promoting cultural diversity and enhancing social cohesion. The Council, in accordance with the Treaty on European Union (TEU), authorises actions that support cultural initiatives, including the appointment of representatives to oversee missions related to cultural exchange. Decisions made by the committee concerning cultural policies reflect a commitment to fostering a shared European identity, extending the powers of the EU in cultural matters, as proposed in various relevant proposals since November. This approach aligns with the broader objectives of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), ensuring that cultural transmission remains a priority within the European Union's political agenda.",
