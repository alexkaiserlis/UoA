  "summary": "The term \"Andean Group countries\" is a redirect to \"Andean Community countries,\" which refers to a regional integration initiative established by Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, formalized in the Cartagena Agreement. This group aims to facilitate economic cooperation and trade among its members through the reduction of tariff barriers and the establishment of preferential trade agreements. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, the Andean Community countries are recognized as developing nations with specific status that encourages joint initiatives. The EU's cooperation with these countries often involves adaptations in administrative processes to verify the origin of products and ensure compliance with said agreements, thereby enhancing mutual economic benefits and fostering closer ties.",
