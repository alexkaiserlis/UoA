  "summary": "The term \"street children\" refers to minors who are homeless and live in public spaces, often facing severe socio-economic challenges. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the plight of street children is addressed through various social affairs initiatives aimed at their protection and integration. The EU emphasizes the importance of safeguarding children's rights, as outlined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and encourages member states to implement policies that provide support, education, and rehabilitation for these vulnerable groups. Effective measures are crucial to combatting the social exclusion and marginalization that street children frequently encounter.",
