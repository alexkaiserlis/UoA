  "summary": "The concept of \"secret service\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to agencies responsible for national security and intelligence operations. These entities operate under strict legal mandates to ensure the protection of state interests and public safety. The regulatory oversight of secret services is crucial, as it balances the need for confidentiality and the safeguarding of civil liberties. In the context of EU cooperation, member states may share intelligence to combat transnational threats, necessitating harmonized legal standards. The role of secret services is thus integral to both national defense and broader EU security policies, reflecting a commitment to collaborative security measures.",
