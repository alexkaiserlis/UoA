  "summary": "Occupational migration refers to the movement of individuals across borders for the purpose of employment, a significant aspect of the EU's migration policy framework. This concept encompasses various legal instruments and regulations aimed at facilitating the entry and residence of skilled workers from non-EU countries. The EU promotes occupational migration to address labor shortages in specific sectors, enhance economic growth, and foster cultural exchange. Regulatory measures, such as the Blue Card Directive, provide a structured approach to attract talent while ensuring compliance with national labor laws and integration policies. Thus, occupational migration plays a crucial role in shaping the EU's labor market dynamics.",
