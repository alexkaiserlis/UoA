  "summary": "The concept \"La Mancha\" serves as a redirect to the preferred term \"Castile-La Mancha,\" a significant region in Spain known for its agricultural products, including the renowned manchego cheese. This region is recognized under EU regulations for its protected designation of origin (PDO), which involves specific production methods and geographical indications. The registration of such designations requires detailed specifications and justifications, ensuring that foodstuffs bearing the name meet stringent criteria. Applications for PDO status are examined and approved based on their compliance with EU standards, and any amendments to these designations are documented and published in the official register. Hence, Castile-La Mancha plays a crucial role in the EU's regulatory framework concerning agricultural products.",
