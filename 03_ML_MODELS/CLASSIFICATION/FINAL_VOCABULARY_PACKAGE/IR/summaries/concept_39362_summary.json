  "summary": "The term \"non-EU national\" refers to individuals who are not citizens of any European Union member state. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, non-EU nationals are subject to specific provisions regarding immigration, residency, and employment. These individuals may seek to enter the EU for various purposes, including work, study, or family reunification. The legal status and rights of non-EU nationals are governed by both EU regulations and national laws, which can vary significantly across member states. Understanding the implications of this status is essential for compliance with international law and the protection of individual rights within the EU.",
