  "summary": "Racism, as defined within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, encompasses discriminatory practices based on race or ethnicity, often intersecting with xenophobia. The European Union actively monitors and addresses these issues through various regulations and agreements, aimed at protecting the rights and freedoms of all communities. In June, the European Parliament approved a proposal establishing a comprehensive strategy for combating racism and xenophobia, emphasizing cooperation among member states. This initiative aligns with the conclusions of the Council and the opinions expressed in official journals. The purpose of these efforts is to ensure compliance with the Treaty on European Union and enhance community solidarity in accordance with established principles.",
