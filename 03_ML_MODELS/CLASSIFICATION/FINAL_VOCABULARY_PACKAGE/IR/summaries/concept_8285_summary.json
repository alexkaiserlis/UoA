  "summary": "The \"stabilisation and association agreement\" (SAA) is a pivotal legal instrument in the EU's engagement with Balkan countries, including Albania and Montenegro. It serves as a framework for fostering partnerships and facilitating the integration of these nations into the EU. The SAA outlines specificities regarding trade, political dialogue, and cooperation, affirming commitments made during the Thessaloniki Summit. This agreement is characterized by its uninterruptedly evolving nature, with revisions and updates deposited in a chronological manner. The process involves initialling drafts, followed by a checklist of requirements to ensure authenticity and compliance. As candidates progress, the SAA aims to enrich bilateral relations while addressing indeterminate challenges, thus serving as a foundational tool for EU enlargement in the region.",
