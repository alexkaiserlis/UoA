  "summary": "The concept of \"nuk?limas,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"adjournment,\" pertains to parliamentary proceedings within the European Union's legislative framework. Adjournment refers to the formal suspension of a parliamentary session, allowing for a temporary cessation of debates and deliberations. This procedural mechanism is essential for managing the legislative agenda, providing members with the opportunity to regroup, assess ongoing discussions, and prepare for subsequent sessions. In the context of EU regulatory documents, understanding adjournment is crucial, as it influences the timing and flow of legislative processes, ensuring that democratic deliberation is maintained while allowing for necessary breaks in proceedings.",
