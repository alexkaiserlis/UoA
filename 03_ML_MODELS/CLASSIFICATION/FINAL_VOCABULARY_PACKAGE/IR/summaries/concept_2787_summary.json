  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the term \"stockbroker\" is redirected to the preferred term \"financial occupation.\" This reflects the broader categorization of roles within the financial services sector, particularly under the category of \"free movement of capital.\" Stockbrokers facilitate the buying and selling of securities, playing a critical role in capital markets. The regulation of financial occupations, including stockbrokers, is essential for ensuring transparency, investor protection, and the integrity of financial systems across member states. This alignment with EU principles promotes a cohesive regulatory environment that supports economic growth and cross-border investment.",
