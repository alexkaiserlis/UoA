  "summary": "The concept of \"vulnerable energy consumer,\" often redirected to \"energy poverty,\" pertains to individuals or households facing difficulties in accessing essential energy services due to financial constraints. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this issue is critical for ensuring equitable energy access and protecting consumers' rights. The EU has implemented various directives aimed at alleviating energy poverty, promoting social inclusion, and enhancing energy efficiency. By addressing the needs of vulnerable energy consumers, the EU seeks to foster a sustainable energy market while safeguarding the well-being of its citizens, thereby reinforcing the principles of solidarity and social justice within its member states.",
