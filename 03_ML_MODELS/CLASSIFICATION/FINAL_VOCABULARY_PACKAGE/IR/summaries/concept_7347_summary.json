  "summary": "The concept of \"citizen's duties\" within the framework of EU legal and regulatory documents underscores the responsibilities that accompany the rights and freedoms granted to EU citizens. These duties may include civic participation, adherence to the rule of law, and respect for the rights of others. While the EU primarily emphasizes the protection of individual rights, it also recognizes that active citizenship involves obligations that contribute to societal cohesion and democratic governance. This balance between rights and duties is essential for fostering a responsible and engaged citizenry, which is vital for the functioning of the European Union's democratic institutions.",
