  "summary": "Intraurban commuting refers to the movement of individuals within urban areas, often for employment or educational purposes. This concept is significant in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning migration policies and urban planning. The European Union recognizes the importance of facilitating intraurban commuting to enhance labor mobility and economic integration among member states. Legal instruments may address issues such as transportation infrastructure, environmental impact, and social inclusion, ensuring that commuting patterns align with broader migration strategies. Understanding intraurban commuting is essential for developing effective policies that promote sustainable urban development and address demographic changes within the EU.",
