  "summary": "The concept of \"home learning,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"home education,\" pertains to the educational framework wherein children receive instruction primarily within the home environment rather than traditional educational institutions. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, home education is subject to varying national regulations, reflecting the principle of subsidiarity. Member States retain the authority to legislate on educational matters, leading to diverse approaches to home education. This concept is significant in discussions surrounding educational rights, parental autonomy, and compliance with educational standards, emphasizing the need for a balanced regulatory framework that respects individual freedoms while ensuring quality education.",
