  "summary": "\"Political cohabitation\" refers to a situation in which different political parties or groups share power within a governing body, often resulting from coalition agreements or electoral outcomes where no single party achieves a majority. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, political cohabitation can influence legislative processes, decision-making, and the implementation of policies. It necessitates negotiation and compromise among diverse political entities, thereby impacting the stability and functionality of governance structures. Understanding political cohabitation is crucial for analyzing the dynamics of EU institutions, particularly in relation to the balance of power and collaborative governance within member states.",
