In regulatory frameworks, growth points are often highlighted in strategic documents aimed at enhancing regional competitiveness and addressing disparities among member states. The identification of growth points can influence funding allocations, policy initiatives, and investment strategies, thereby playing a crucial role in the EU's broader economic governance.
