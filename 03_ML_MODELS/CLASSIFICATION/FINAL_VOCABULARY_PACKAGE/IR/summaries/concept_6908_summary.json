This concept is crucial for enhancing user experience and ensuring compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Interactivity facilitates real-time feedback and data exchange, which is essential for transparent communication and informed consent in digital services. As the EU continues to advance its digital single market strategy, fostering interactivity becomes imperative for promoting innovation while safeguarding user rights and privacy in an increasingly interconnected digital landscape.",
