  "summary": "The \"multifibre arrangement\" (MFA), now commonly referred to as the \"multifibre agreement,\" was an international trade framework governing textiles. Initially negotiated in the 1970s, the MFA established reciprocal trade procedures among participating countries, including China, to regulate textile products. The agreement aimed at maintaining a balance in trade by applying quotas and ensuring the maintenance of fair competition. Over the years, the MFA underwent modifications and extensions, with letters exchanged regarding its application and the establishment of protocols. The conclusion of negotiations led to its provisional application until its eventual expiration, marking a significant period in international textile trade regulation.",
