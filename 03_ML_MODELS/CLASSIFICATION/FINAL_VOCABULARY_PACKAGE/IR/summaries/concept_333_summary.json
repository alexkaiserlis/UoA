  "summary": "Curaçao, categorized under the EU’s overseas countries and territories (OCTs), plays a significant role in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks. This island, alongside Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba, benefits from the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP), which facilitates trade by allowing the import of sustainably sourced goods, such as cacao and powdered caseinate. The OCTs, including Curaçao, are encouraged to diversify their economies, generating gains through investments in sectors like milling and cleaning. The EU’s support aims to reactivate local municipalities, fostering realistic opportunities for growth while ensuring compliance with environmental standards, thus enhancing the region’s overall economic resilience.",
