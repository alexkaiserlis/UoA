  "summary": "Ironmongery, classified under the category of iron, steel, and other metal industries, encompasses a range of hardware used in construction and building applications. This includes items such as doors, windows, shutters, and gates, which are essential for compartmentation and fire escape routes. In EU legal and regulatory contexts, ironmongery must conform to binding laws and standards, ensuring safety and functionality. The classification and importation of these products are governed by a tariff code that facilitates statistical analysis and customs procedures. Retrospective attestation of compliance is often invoked to verify adherence to safety regulations, thus ensuring that all uses of ironmongery are wholly or partly compliant with EU directives.",
