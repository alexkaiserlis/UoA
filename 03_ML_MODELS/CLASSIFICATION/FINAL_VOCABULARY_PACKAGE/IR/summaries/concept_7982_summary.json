  "summary": "The European Defence Agency (EDA) plays a pivotal role in aligning the defence capabilities of EU member states, ensuring a harmonised approach to security and defence policy under the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Established to enhance cooperation, the agency's director oversees several units that support joint initiatives and resource allocation. The EDA addresses inconsistencies in defence procurement and employment practices, respecting human rights and legitimate expectations of staff. Through various regulations and amendments, the agency aims to grant benefits and support resettlement efforts for dependent individuals, whilst also providing a framework for the entry of new members into collaborative defence projects.",
