  "summary": "The concept of \"church\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the intersection of culture and religion, particularly in relation to the protection of religious freedoms and cultural heritage. The EU recognizes the significance of churches as institutions that contribute to the cultural identity and social fabric of member states. Legal provisions often address the role of churches in public life, including their rights to operate freely, engage in charitable activities, and participate in dialogue with public authorities. This concept is crucial for ensuring respect for diverse religious practices while upholding fundamental rights enshrined in EU treaties.",
