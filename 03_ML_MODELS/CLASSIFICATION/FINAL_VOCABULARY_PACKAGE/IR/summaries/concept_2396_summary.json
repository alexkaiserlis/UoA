  "summary": "Arboriculture, classified under agricultural activity, encompasses the cultivation of trees and shrubs, particularly for forestry and horticulture purposes. In the EU regulatory framework, it is crucial for ensuring the genetic purity and provenance of seedlings, which must conform to stringent standards. This includes the propagation of species such as cedrus, populus, and juniperus, which are subject to specific labelling and authorizing protocols. The concept addresses the need for justifying the identity of organisms and mitigating pest threats, thereby affording a sustainable approach to planting. Compliance with these regulations is vital for satisfying market demands and addressing potential shortages in forestry resources.",
