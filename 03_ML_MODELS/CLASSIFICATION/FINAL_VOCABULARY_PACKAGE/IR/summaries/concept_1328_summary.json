  "summary": "The concept of \"tax on unearned income,\" redirected to \"tax on investment income,\" encompasses various forms of untaxed revenues generated by taxpayers, including interest and dividends. In the EU, this tax aims to eliminate evasion and ensure uniformity across member states, aligning with OECD guidelines. The challenges posed by dual taxation and unreported income necessitate a seamless coordination among jurisdictions. This broader framework seeks to save resources while retaining beneficial aspects for resident owners. Instances of withholding taxes and the exchange of information among G20 nations are crucial in addressing these issues, ensuring that nothing is overlooked in the pursuit of fair taxation.",
