  "summary": "The concept of \"prevention of war,\" redirected to \"conflict prevention,\" is pivotal within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly under the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). This strategic approach aims to address deteriorating situations in regions such as the Caucasus and Sudan, where crises may impede regional stability. The European Union External Action (EUAVSEC) mandates missions to appoint representatives who implement objectives aligned with political and security interests. Decisions regarding the appointment of heads of missions are reviewed periodically to ensure effectiveness. The EU's commitment to conflict prevention is reflected in its ongoing efforts to extend its influence and achieve security objectives in external affairs, particularly in high-risk areas.",
