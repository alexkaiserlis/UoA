  "summary": "Thermal discharge refers to the release of heated water or other fluids into the environment, often resulting from industrial processes or energy production. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, thermal discharge is a significant concern due to its potential to cause deterioration of the environment, particularly affecting aquatic ecosystems. The EU Water Framework Directive and related legislation aim to regulate thermal discharges to mitigate their adverse effects on water quality and biodiversity. Compliance with these regulations is essential for maintaining ecological balance and ensuring sustainable development, highlighting the importance of effective monitoring and management practices in relevant sectors.",
