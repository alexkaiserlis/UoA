  "summary": "The concept of \"tectonics,\" categorized under natural and applied sciences, is redirected to the preferred term \"geology\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Geology encompasses the study of Earth's structure, including tectonic processes that shape landscapes and influence natural resources. This understanding is crucial for EU policies related to environmental protection, land use planning, and resource management. Regulatory documents often reference geological assessments to ensure compliance with sustainability standards and mitigate risks associated with natural hazards. Thus, the relationship between tectonics and geology is pivotal in informing EU legislation aimed at fostering ecological resilience and promoting informed decision-making in land management.",
