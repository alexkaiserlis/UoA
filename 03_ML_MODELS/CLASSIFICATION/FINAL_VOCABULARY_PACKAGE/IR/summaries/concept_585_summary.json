  "summary": "The concept of \"women's rights\" within the EU legal framework encompasses a range of fundamental rights and freedoms aimed at promoting gender equality and protecting women from discrimination. This includes legislative measures such as the Directive on Equal Treatment and the Gender Equality Strategy, which seek to ensure equitable access to employment, healthcare, and social services. The EU actively advocates for the elimination of gender-based violence and supports initiatives that empower women in political and economic spheres. By integrating women's rights into its regulatory agenda, the EU reinforces its commitment to uphold human dignity and promote social justice across member states.",
