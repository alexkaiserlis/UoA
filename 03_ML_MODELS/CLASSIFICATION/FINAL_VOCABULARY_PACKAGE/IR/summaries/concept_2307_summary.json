  "summary": "Industrial fishing refers to large-scale fishing operations that utilize advanced technology and vessels to catch significant quantities of marine species in designated waters. Within the EU regulatory framework, industrial fishing is subject to strict compliance with quotas and limitations established to ensure sustainable stock management. Member States must allocate fishing rights according to the Common Fisheries Policy, which provides a system for monitoring catches and ensuring that vessels operate within the exclusive economic zone. Regulations may prohibit certain practices, and information regarding catches must be communicated to relevant authorities. The aim is to maintain fish stocks and abide by conservation measures while balancing economic interests.",
