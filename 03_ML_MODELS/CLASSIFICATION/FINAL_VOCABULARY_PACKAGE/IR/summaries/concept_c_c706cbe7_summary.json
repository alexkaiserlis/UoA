  "summary": "The concept of \"wildlife restoration,\" redirected to \"nature restoration,\" pertains to EU environmental policy aimed at rehabilitating ecosystems and enhancing biodiversity. This legal framework is essential for achieving the objectives set forth in various EU directives, such as the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive, which mandate the protection and recovery of natural habitats and species. Nature restoration encompasses a range of activities designed to restore ecological balance and resilience, thereby contributing to sustainable development and climate change mitigation. The EU emphasizes the importance of integrating nature restoration into broader environmental strategies to ensure long-term ecological health and compliance with international environmental obligations.",
