  "summary": "The concept of \"workplace harassment,\" redirected to the preferred term \"harassment at work,\" pertains to the legal and regulatory frameworks established by the European Union to ensure safe and equitable working conditions. EU directives, such as the Framework Directive 89/391/EEC, emphasize the obligation of employers to prevent harassment, thereby fostering a respectful workplace environment. Harassment at work encompasses unwanted behaviors that undermine an individualâ€™s dignity and can lead to a toxic work atmosphere. The EU actively promotes measures to combat such conduct, reinforcing the importance of organizational policies that protect employees from harassment and ensure compliance with established labor standards.",
