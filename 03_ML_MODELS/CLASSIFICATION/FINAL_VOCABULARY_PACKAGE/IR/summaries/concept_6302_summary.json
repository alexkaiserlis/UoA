  "summary": "The concept of \"organisation of research\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to the structured coordination and management of research activities across member states. This encompasses the establishment of collaborative networks, funding mechanisms, and regulatory compliance to enhance innovation and intellectual property rights. The EU promotes the organisation of research through various initiatives, such as Horizon Europe, which aims to foster transnational cooperation and ensure that research outputs align with societal needs. Effective organisation is crucial for maximizing the impact of research investments and facilitating knowledge transfer, thereby contributing to the EU's overarching goals of economic growth and competitiveness.",
