  "summary": "The concept of \"pet shop\" falls under the category of distributive trades within the EU regulatory framework. Pet shops are retail establishments that specialize in the sale of pets and related products, necessitating compliance with various EU directives concerning animal welfare, consumer protection, and trade practices. These establishments must adhere to regulations that ensure the humane treatment of animals, proper licensing, and transparent sales practices. Additionally, pet shops are subject to specific health and safety standards to safeguard both animals and consumers. As such, they play a critical role in the broader context of EU legislation aimed at promoting responsible pet ownership and ethical trade practices.",
