  "summary": "The concept of \"illegal abortion\" pertains to instances where the termination of pregnancy occurs outside the legal frameworks established by EU member states. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, illegal abortion raises significant issues related to reproductive rights, public health, and the protection of womenâ€™s rights. The EU promotes a harmonized approach to health care, yet disparities exist in national laws regarding abortion. Consequently, illegal abortion often leads to serious health risks for women, necessitating regulatory measures to ensure safe and legal access to reproductive health services across the EU.",
