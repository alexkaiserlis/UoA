  "summary": "The \"European Space Vehicle Launcher Development Organization\" is a redirect to the \"European Space Agency\" (ESA), which plays a pivotal role in the conception and oversight of space initiatives within the EU. ESA manages various phases of satellite deployment, including the Galileo GNSS and EGNOS navigation systems. It undertakes the governance of intangible assets and intellectual property, ensuring proper representation and ownership among member states. ESA's supervisory structure involves consultations with subcontractors and observers, who are tasked with managing the modalities of projects. The agency's consensus-driven approach implies a commitment to horizontal cooperation, facilitating the effective exercise of its regulatory functions in the space sector.",
