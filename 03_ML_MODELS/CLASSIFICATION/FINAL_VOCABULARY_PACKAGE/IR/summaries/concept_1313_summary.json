  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"direct tax\" refers to taxes levied directly on individuals or corporations, such as income or corporate taxes, as opposed to indirect taxes like VAT. This taxation system incorporates measures to counter evasion and avoidance, ensuring that profits are accurately disclosed and safeguarded. EU administrations increasingly collaborate to strengthen neutrality and transparency, preventing unauthorized tax practices and artificial distortions. Citizens benefit from a more equitable tax system, while officials conduct enquiries to observe compliance. The pooling of resources across frontiers enhances the effectiveness of collecting direct taxes, thereby affording greater fiscal stability and care in tax administration.",
