  "summary": "The concept of \"reduction of prices,\" redirected to the preferred term \"price reduction,\" is pivotal in EU legal and regulatory frameworks. It encompasses measures aimed at stabilising market conditions, particularly in sectors like agriculture, where products such as semolina, durum wheat, and various fruits (e.g., clementines, nectarines, and peaches) are affected by price fluctuations. Price reductions can arise from the ascertainment of overrun stocks, necessitating realignments in pricing strategies. Regulatory bodies may implement price reductions to address gaps in supply chains or to counteract the disturbing effects of market collapses. Such measures ensure that consumers benefit from lower prices on essential goods, including tomatoes, barley, and oranges, while maintaining a catalogue of standards for quality and moisture content. Henceforth, effective price reduction policies are crucial for preventing excessive pricing and ensuring equitable access to food products across the EU.",
