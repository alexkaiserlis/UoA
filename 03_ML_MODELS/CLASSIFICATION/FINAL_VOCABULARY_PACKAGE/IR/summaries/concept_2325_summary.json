  "summary": "The concept of \"penalty points driving licence\" is integral to the EU's transport policy, specifically addressing driver fitness and safety. This regulatory framework employs a centralised system to monitor drivers' acuity and visual capabilities, ensuring compliance with standards related to eyesight, including conditions like diabetes and epilepsy. Penalty points are assigned for infractions, leading to potential disqualifications, thereby rectifying unsafe driving behaviors. The interoperability of registries allows for stronger interconnection across member states, ensuring that driving records are accessible and comprehensive. This system demands that drivers maintain a certain level of visual strength, supported by specialists who assess their fitness to drive. The driving licence, therefore, serves as a critical item in promoting road safety across the EU.",
