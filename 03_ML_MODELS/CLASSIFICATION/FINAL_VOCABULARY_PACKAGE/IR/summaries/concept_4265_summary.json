  "summary": "The concept of \"international statistics\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the systematic collection, analysis, and dissemination of data that transcends national boundaries. This data is crucial for economic analysis, enabling policymakers to assess trends, make informed decisions, and foster cooperation among member states. The EU employs international statistics to monitor economic performance, evaluate the impact of policies, and ensure compliance with regulatory standards. By harmonizing statistical methodologies across countries, the EU enhances the reliability and comparability of data, thereby supporting evidence-based policymaking and facilitating economic integration within the single market.",
