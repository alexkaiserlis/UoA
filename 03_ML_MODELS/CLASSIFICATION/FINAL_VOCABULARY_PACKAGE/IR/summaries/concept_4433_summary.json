  "summary": "The term \"telex\" refers to a telecommunications service that enables the transmission of written messages over long distances, primarily through teleprinter technology. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, telex has historical significance, particularly in the facilitation of communication between member states and institutions. Although largely supplanted by modern digital communication methods, telex played a crucial role in the early stages of EU integration, ensuring the swift exchange of information and documentation. Its legacy persists in the regulatory landscape, highlighting the evolution of communication technologies and their impact on legislative processes within the EU.",
