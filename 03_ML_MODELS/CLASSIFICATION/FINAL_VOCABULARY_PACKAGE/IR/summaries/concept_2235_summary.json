Under EU environmental policy, national parks are integral to the Natura 2000 network, which aims to protect habitats and species of European significance. These parks are governed by strict legal frameworks that promote sustainable management practices, ensuring ecological integrity while allowing for public enjoyment and education. The establishment and management of national parks are often aligned with EU directives, such as the Habitats Directive, reinforcing the commitment to environmental preservation and sustainable development within the EU.",
