This agreement typically involves the concessionaire providing services or goods in exchange for a fee or revenue share, often in sectors like public utilities or transport. The regulatory oversight ensures compliance with EU directives, particularly concerning competition and consumer protection. Concessionaires are subject to rigorous standards to promote fair trade practices and transparency, aligning with the EU's commitment to fostering a competitive internal market while safeguarding public interests.",
