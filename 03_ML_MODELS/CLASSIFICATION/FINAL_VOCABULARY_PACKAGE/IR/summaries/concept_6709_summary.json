  "summary": "The \"common security and defence policy\" (CSDP) is a pivotal element of the European Union's legal framework, aimed at enhancing collective security and defense capabilities. It encompasses various missions, including EUAVSEC and EULEX, which are crucial for stabilizing regions such as the Sahel and Iraq. The CSDP operates under the auspices of the European Security and Defence College (ESDC), facilitating training and cooperation among member states. Legal instruments governing the CSDP include privileges and immunities for personnel, as outlined in the Helsinki agreements. Notable operations, like Athena and EUCAP, reflect the EU's commitment to addressing security challenges, recalling the importance of strategic partnerships and observer missions in complex environments.",
