  "summary": "\"Trade-related investment measures\" (TRIMs) refer to regulatory frameworks that govern how investments are treated in the context of international trade. Within the EU's legal and regulatory landscape, TRIMs are crucial for ensuring compliance with World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, particularly in preventing trade distortions. These measures can include local content requirements and performance mandates that affect foreign direct investment. The EU actively monitors and enforces TRIMs to promote fair competition and protect its internal market. As a redirect to the preferred term \"TRIMs,\" this concept encapsulates the intersection of trade policy and investment regulation, underscoring the EU's commitment to maintaining a balanced trade environment.",
