  "summary": "The term \"collectivised economy,\" a redirect to \"collectivized economy,\" refers to an economic structure characterized by collective ownership and management of resources and production means. Within the EU legal and regulatory framework, this concept is significant in discussions surrounding economic models that prioritize social welfare over individual profit. Collectivised economies often emerge in contexts where state intervention aims to redistribute wealth and ensure equitable access to resources. The EU's regulatory policies may engage with collectivised economic principles, particularly in areas such as social inclusion, sustainable development, and cooperative enterprises, reflecting a commitment to diverse economic structures within member states.",
