  "summary": "The \"Caricom countries\" refer to a cooperative organization of Caribbean nations, including Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Guyana, and Suriname, among others. This framework aims to enhance economic integration and cooperation among member states. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, agreements with Caricom countries often involve protocols on trade, notably sugar management and delivery guarantees. These agreements facilitate the exchange of goods under preferential terms, as outlined in the aforementioned conventions. The EU's engagement with these countries is part of its broader strategy to strengthen ties with ACP nations, ensuring democratic governance and sustainable development in the region.",
