  "summary": "The \"European symbol\" serves as an emblem of the EU's commitment to fostering a shared identity among its member states, inextricably linked to the principles of multilingualism and cultural diversity. This symbol heightens awareness of the EU's pedagogical role in shaping learners' competencies and careers, particularly in agrifood and architectural sectors. By cofinancing initiatives that promote equalisation and inclusivity, the EU tackles obsolescence in cultural heritage. The symbol also enhances the momentum of collaborative projects, forging connections among sportswomen and sportsmen, and reaffirming the EU's dedication to a plethora of educational and cultural exchanges. Ultimately, it embodies the EU's aspiration for a unified yet diverse civilisation.",
