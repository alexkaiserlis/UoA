  "summary": "Euroscepticism refers to the critical stance towards the European Union (EU) and its regulatory frameworks, often questioning the legitimacy and efficacy of EU institutions. This concept has significant implications in legal and regulatory contexts, as it influences public opinion and political discourse surrounding EU legislation and governance. Euroscepticism can manifest in various forms, including opposition to EU treaties, skepticism about the benefits of EU membership, and calls for national sovereignty over EU regulations. Understanding euroscepticism is crucial for policymakers and legal experts, as it shapes the dynamics of EU integration and the development of future legal instruments within the European construction.",
