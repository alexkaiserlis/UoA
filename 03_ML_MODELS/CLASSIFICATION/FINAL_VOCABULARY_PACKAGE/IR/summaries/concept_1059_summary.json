  "summary": "The term \"cast-iron\" pertains to the category of iron, steel, and other metal industries within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Cast-iron products, often produced in foundries like those in Changsha and Tianjin, are integral to various applications, including hydrants and machinery components. The regulatory landscape addresses issues such as wrongful practices in metalwork and the quality of castings. Notably, the EU promotes standards for machined cast-iron items, ensuring compliance with directives that govern manufacturing processes. Initiatives to enhance the sustainability of cast-iron production, particularly in regions like Baoding and Weifang, reflect the EU's commitment to environmental responsibility and innovation in industries such as fundició and dúctil metalwork.",
