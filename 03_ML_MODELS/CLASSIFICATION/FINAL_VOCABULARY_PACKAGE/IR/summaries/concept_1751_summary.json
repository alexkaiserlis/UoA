  "summary": "The concept of \"silent majority\" in the context of EU politics and public safety refers to a demographic segment that, while not vocally engaged in political discourse, holds significant sway over electoral outcomes and policy decisions. This group often remains underrepresented in public debates, leading to a disconnect between policymakers and the electorate. In EU regulatory frameworks, acknowledging the silent majority is crucial for fostering inclusive governance and ensuring that diverse perspectives inform legislative processes. Understanding this concept aids in addressing the complexities of public sentiment and enhances the legitimacy of democratic institutions within the EU.",
