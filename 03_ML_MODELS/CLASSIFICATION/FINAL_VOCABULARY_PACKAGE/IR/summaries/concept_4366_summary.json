It involves the preparation and checking of documentation, which may include guidelines for various sectors such as veterinary and fishery. Independent experts and specialist laboratories contribute to this network, proposing models for effective identification and inventory management, thereby facilitating the coordination of projects and ensuring compliance with established standards.",
