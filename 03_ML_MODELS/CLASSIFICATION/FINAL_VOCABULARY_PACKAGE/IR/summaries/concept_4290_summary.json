  "summary": "A \"buffer stock\" refers to a strategic reserve of commodities maintained by the EU to stabilize market prices and ensure supply security in international trade. This regulatory mechanism is particularly relevant in sectors vulnerable to price volatility, such as agriculture. By intervening in the market through the purchase and storage of surplus goods, the EU can mitigate the adverse effects of sudden supply shocks or demand fluctuations. The legal framework governing buffer stocks is designed to enhance market resilience and protect both producers and consumers, thereby promoting fair competition and sustainable economic development within the EU.",
