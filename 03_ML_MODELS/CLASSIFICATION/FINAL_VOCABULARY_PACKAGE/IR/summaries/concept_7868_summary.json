  "summary": "The concept \"regions of Lithuania\" pertains to the administrative divisions within Lithuania, which are crucial for EU legal and regulatory frameworks. These regions, such as Kupiškis and Kaunas, demarcate areas for focused regionalisation efforts. In the context of agricultural regulations, particularly concerning swine farming, the Lithuanian regions are significant in managing outbreaks of infectious diseases, including African swine fever. The EU collaborates with Lithuania to monitor viral populations and prepare for potential disturbances caused by feral pigs. This regulatory approach aims to mitigate unjustified barriers to trade and ensure the profitability of holdings while safeguarding public health and regional economies.",
