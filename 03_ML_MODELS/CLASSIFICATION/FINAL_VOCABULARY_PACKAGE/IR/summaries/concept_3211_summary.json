  "summary": "A \"self-service store\" refers to a retail establishment where customers independently select and purchase goods without direct assistance from staff. This concept falls under the category of distributive trades within EU legal frameworks, which regulate various aspects of retail operations, including consumer protection, competition law, and food safety standards. Self-service stores are subject to specific regulations that ensure transparency in pricing, product information, and compliance with health regulations. The EU promotes such retail formats to enhance consumer choice and streamline distribution channels, thereby fostering a competitive market environment. Understanding these regulatory implications is essential for compliance and operational efficiency.",
