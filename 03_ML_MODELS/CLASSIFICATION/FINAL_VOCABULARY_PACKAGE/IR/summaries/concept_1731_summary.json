  "summary": "The concept of \"sectoral analysis,\" redirected to \"input-output analysis,\" is pivotal in EU economic analysis, particularly for assessing the impact of policy measures on various sectors. This analytical mechanism establishes a framework for calculating the allocation of resources and liabilities across pooled assets and income streams. By examining the realised gains and losses within a specified quarter, it provides insights into the maturity of financial instruments, such as securities and currency. The European Central Bank (ECB) utilizes this analysis to adjust monetary policy, ensuring that the interests of national banks are aligned with overarching EU statutes. This process is crucial for informed decision-making, as it sheds light on the operational adjustments needed to meet longer-term economic goals.",
