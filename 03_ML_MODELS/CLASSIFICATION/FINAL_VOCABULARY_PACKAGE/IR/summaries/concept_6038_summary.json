  "summary": "The concept of \"dyestuff\" in EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to substances used as colorants, often derived from natural sources such as dyewood or synthesized through chemical processes. These viscous and pungent compounds, including azodyes like azobenzene and various arylamines, are subject to stringent regulations due to potential health risks, including sensitizers and bioavailable contaminants. The EU monitors the use of specific dyestuffs, such as indigo and naphthol derivatives, to prevent adulterated products. Regulations also address the presence of harmful additives, like dimethylammoniumchloride and nitro compounds, ensuring consumer safety and environmental protection in the dyeing industry.",
