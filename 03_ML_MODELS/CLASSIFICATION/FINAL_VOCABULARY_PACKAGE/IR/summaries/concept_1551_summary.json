  "summary": "The concept of \"case-law (EU)\" refers to the body of judicial decisions made by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and other EU courts, which interpret and apply EU law. This case-law serves as a critical source of legal authority, shaping the understanding and implementation of EU regulations and directives. It ensures uniformity in the application of EU law across member states, providing guidance on legal principles and resolving ambiguities. The evolving nature of case-law reflects the dynamic interplay between EU institutions and national legal systems, reinforcing the rule of law within the European Union.",
