This system allows voters to cast their votes on a single ballot for multiple candidates or options, thereby enhancing efficiency and clarity in electoral outcomes. In the context of EU regulations, the single-ballot system aims to simplify the voting mechanism, reduce the likelihood of errors, and ensure that the electoral procedure aligns with democratic principles. By consolidating choices into one ballot, it facilitates a more straightforward voting experience, which is crucial for maintaining voter engagement and integrity in elections across member states.",
