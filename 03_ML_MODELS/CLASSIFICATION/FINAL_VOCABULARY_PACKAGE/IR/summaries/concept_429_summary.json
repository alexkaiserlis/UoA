  "summary": "The concept of \"promotion of industry,\" redirected to \"industrial development,\" encompasses EU regulatory frameworks aimed at empowering industrial growth and modernization. This involves stimulating productive capacities through innovative techniques and cooperative efforts among various sectors. The EU's approach seeks to realize an upturn in economic performance by addressing unevenly distributed resources and creditworthiness among industries. By tapping into plentiful borrowings and facilitating the grouping of factories, the EU aims to solve dependence on outdated methods. This regulatory landscape is paramount for realizing sustainable industrial structures that can cope with modern challenges, thereby reaffirming the worthiness of investments in industrial development.",
