  "summary": "The \"law of succession\" pertains to the legal framework governing the transfer of rights and obligations upon an individual's death. Within the EU context, it encompasses jurisdictional matters, ensuring the enforcement and recognition of succession decisions across member states. Various instruments, such as regulations and protocols, establish the proper functioning of succession laws, allowing for the adoption of uniform rules. The European Parliament has implemented measures to enhance security and justice in succession cases, providing a certificate that facilitates the acceptance of wills and estates. This area of law is particularly relevant in countries like Denmark and Ireland, where specific articles outline applicable provisions.",
