  "summary": "A \"non-legislative act\" in the context of EU law refers to a type of regulatory instrument that does not involve the formal legislative process typically associated with directives or regulations. These acts are often employed to implement policies or provide guidance without the need for legislative approval. They can include decisions, recommendations, and opinions issued by EU institutions, which serve to enhance the coherence and effectiveness of EU law. Non-legislative acts play a crucial role in the regulatory framework, allowing for flexibility and responsiveness to emerging issues within the EU legal landscape while ensuring compliance with overarching legislative objectives.",
