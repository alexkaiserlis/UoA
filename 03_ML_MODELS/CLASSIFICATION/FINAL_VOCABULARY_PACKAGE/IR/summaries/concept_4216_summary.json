  "summary": "The concept of \"self-determination\" is pivotal in international affairs, particularly within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. It relates to the rights of peoples, notably in contexts like Crimea and Sevastopol, where annexation by the Russian Federation has destabilised regional integrity. The EU actively supports the independence of Ukraine, targeting policies that undermine its sovereignty. Regulatory measures, such as listing entities involved in obstructing Ukraine's territorial integrity, aim to freeze assets and impose restrictive measures on those benefiting from destabilisation. By promoting self-determination, the EU seeks to uphold stability and support individuals and organisations advocating for their rights against foreign threats.",
