  "summary": "International tax law encompasses the legal frameworks and regulations governing taxation across national borders, particularly relevant within the European Union (EU). It addresses issues such as double taxation, tax evasion, and compliance with international treaties. The EU plays a crucial role in harmonizing tax policies among member states to foster economic cooperation and ensure fair competition. This body of law is essential for multinational corporations and individuals engaged in cross-border transactions, as it provides clarity on tax obligations and rights. The interplay between national laws and EU directives shapes the landscape of international tax law, influencing both regulatory practices and legal interpretations.",
