  "summary": "Racial segregation, often addressed through the lens of \"racial discrimination,\" is a concept firmly rooted in EU legal frameworks that combat racism and xenophobia. The EU strongly rejects practices that reinforce inequalities among diverse races and ethnic groups, advocating for liberty and accessibility for all individuals, including those with disabilities. This legal stance emphasizes the importance of partnerships among governmental councils and transnational bodies to fight intolerable discrimination. Lessons learned from history underscore the need for constitutional protections that accommodate multiple identities, ensuring that victims of discrimination, regardless of gender or race, are supported. Henceforward, the EU aims to promote democracy and complementarity in its policies, making valuable strides toward a more inclusive society.",
