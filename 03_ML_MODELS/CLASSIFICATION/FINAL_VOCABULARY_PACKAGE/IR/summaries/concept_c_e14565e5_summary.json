Non-cognitive skills are vital for adapting to diverse work environments and are often integrated into educational and vocational training programs. The EU emphasizes the development of these skills to support lifelong learning and to address the evolving demands of the labor market, thereby promoting a more resilient and adaptable workforce.",
