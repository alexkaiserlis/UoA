  "summary": "Regional policy within the EU framework aims to address disparities among regions, fostering economic cohesion and sustainability. It is modelled to rationalize resource allocation, earmarked for areas facing grave challenges such as underemployment and overcapacity. The policy encourages interreg initiatives, promoting cross-border cooperation. Delegation of funds often involves complex negotiations, where compatibility with EU regulations is crucial to avoid incompatibility issues. In this context, the survival of local economies, including sectors like fishing and ceramic production, is prioritized. The policy also addresses the escalation of regional handicaps, ensuring that support mechanisms are furthered through strategic investments and collaborative efforts, thereby enhancing overall regional development.",
