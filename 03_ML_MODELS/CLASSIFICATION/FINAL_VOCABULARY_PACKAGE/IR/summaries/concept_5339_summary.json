In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, absenteeism is addressed through various directives aimed at improving working conditions and promoting employee well-being. The EU emphasizes the importance of a healthy work-life balance, which can mitigate absenteeism rates. Regulations may include provisions for sick leave, flexible working arrangements, and measures to support mental health.
