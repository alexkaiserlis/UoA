  "summary": "Hydrofracking, commonly referred to as \"fracking,\" is a controversial method employed in the oil industry to extract hydrocarbons from deep geological formations. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, fracking is subject to stringent environmental assessments and regulations aimed at mitigating potential risks to water resources and biodiversity. The European Union has implemented directives that require member states to evaluate the environmental impacts of fracking activities, ensuring compliance with sustainability goals. As a redirect term, \"hydrofracking\" emphasizes the technical process, while \"fracking\" serves as the preferred term in policy discussions, reflecting broader public and regulatory discourse on energy extraction practices.",
