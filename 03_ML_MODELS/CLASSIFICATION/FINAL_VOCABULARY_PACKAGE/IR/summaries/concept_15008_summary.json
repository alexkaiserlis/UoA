  "summary": "\"Multiple discrimination,\" also referred to as \"intersectional discrimination,\" pertains to the legal recognition of individuals facing discrimination based on multiple, intersecting grounds, such as race, gender, and disability. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept underscores the necessity for comprehensive protections that address the complexities of identity and the compounded effects of discrimination. The EU's commitment to fundamental rights necessitates the integration of intersectional perspectives in anti-discrimination legislation, ensuring that all individuals receive equitable treatment and protection under the law.
