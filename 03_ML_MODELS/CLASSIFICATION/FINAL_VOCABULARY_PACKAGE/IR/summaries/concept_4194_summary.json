  "summary": "A \"mixed-ownership company\" is a legal form of organization characterized by ownership that combines public and private capital. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these entities often arise in sectors where both state interests and private investment are essential, such as utilities and infrastructure. The governance structure of mixed-ownership companies typically reflects a hybrid model, balancing public accountability with private sector efficiency. This dual ownership can facilitate the achievement of public policy objectives while attracting private investment. The regulatory oversight of such companies is crucial to ensure compliance with EU competition law and state aid rules.",
