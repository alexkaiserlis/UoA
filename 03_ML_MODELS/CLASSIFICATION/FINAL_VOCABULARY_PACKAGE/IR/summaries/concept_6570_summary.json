  "summary": "Palliative care is a specialized medical approach within the EU health framework, aimed at improving the quality of life for patients with life-limiting illnesses. It focuses on alleviating suffering through comprehensive symptom management and psychosocial support, rather than curative treatment. The EU recognizes the importance of palliative care in its health policies, promoting access to such services across member states. Regulatory frameworks encourage the integration of palliative care into national health systems, ensuring that patients receive holistic care tailored to their needs. This approach aligns with the EU's commitment to patient-centered healthcare and the protection of human dignity in end-of-life situations.",
