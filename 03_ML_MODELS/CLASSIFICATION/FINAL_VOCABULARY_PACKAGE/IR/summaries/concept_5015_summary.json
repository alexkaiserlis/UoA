  "summary": "The term \"credit purchase\" refers to a transaction where goods or services are acquired through financing, allowing consumers to pay over time rather than upfront. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is significant for consumer protection laws, which mandate transparency in credit agreements and ensure that consumers are informed of their rights. The EU has established directives that govern credit purchases, focusing on responsible lending practices and the prevention of over-indebtedness. Such regulations aim to balance market interests with consumer welfare, ensuring equitable access to credit while safeguarding against potential financial pitfalls.",
