  "summary": "The \"free-at-frontier price\" concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to the calculatory price of goods at the point of entry into a market, unburdened by additional costs such as tariffs or transport. This price is crucial for ensuring fair competition and is often administrated through customs regulations. It is warranted that such pricing reflects actual market conditions, avoiding unrepresentative lumps in pricing structures. Regulatory bodies may initiate consultaion processes to address discrepancies, ensuring that newcomers are not disadvantaged. The free-at-frontier price is essential for commodities like sylvaner and cheddar, where accurate pricing impacts trade dynamics and consumer choices.",
