  "summary": "The concept of \"modern history\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses the examination of significant political, social, and economic transformations that have shaped contemporary Europe. This period, often marked by events such as the establishment of the European Union, the evolution of human rights legislation, and the integration of member states, serves as a critical reference point for understanding current EU policies. Legal documents often draw upon insights from modern history to inform regulatory practices, ensuring that historical precedents are considered in the formulation of laws and directives that govern the Union today.",
