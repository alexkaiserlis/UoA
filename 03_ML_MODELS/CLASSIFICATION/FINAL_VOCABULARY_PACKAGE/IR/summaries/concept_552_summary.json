  "summary": "The \"rights of aliens\" concept within EU international law encompasses the legal status and protections afforded to foreign nationals, particularly in the context of immigration and refugee status. This framework aims to harmonise practices across member states, facilitating the integration of migrants while combating illegal flows. Instruments such as the Schengen Agreement and the Geneva Convention provide guidelines for the treatment of refugees and the responsibilities of carriers transporting them. The EU's acquis includes provisions that retain the rights of aliens, ensuring they can effectively appeal decisions and participate in proceedings. This initiative builds upon the aforementioned principles, aiming for greater freedom and protection for all aliens within the EU.",
