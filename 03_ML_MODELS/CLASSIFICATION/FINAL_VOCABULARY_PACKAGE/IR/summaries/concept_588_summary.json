  "summary": "Dumping, in the context of EU competition law, refers to the practice where industries, such as those producing ceramiche or agrob products, sell goods at prices lower than their normal value, potentially harming local markets. This phenomenon can affect various sectors, including qumicas and those manufacturing tiles like carreaux and azulejera. The EU employs anti-dumping measures to protect its industries, such as those in Castellon and Sassuolo, from unfair competition. Investigations may involve examining pricing strategies of companies like Marazzi and Mettlach, ensuring compliance with regulations to maintain fair trade practices across member states, including those in Lombarde and Hsinchu.",
