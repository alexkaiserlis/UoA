  "summary": "The \"gross regional product\" (GRP) is a critical economic indicator within the category of national accounts, reflecting the total economic output of a specific region. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, GRP serves as a vital metric for assessing regional economic performance and disparities, guiding the allocation of funds and resources under various EU cohesion policies. By evaluating GRP, policymakers can identify regions in need of support, ensuring compliance with EU objectives aimed at fostering balanced economic development across member states. Thus, GRP plays an essential role in shaping regional economic strategies and enhancing overall EU integration.",
