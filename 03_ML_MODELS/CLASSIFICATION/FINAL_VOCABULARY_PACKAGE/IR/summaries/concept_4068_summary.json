  "summary": "The Treaty on European Union (TEU) is a foundational legal document that irrevocably establishes the European Union's framework, facilitating uncoordinated member state actions while ensuring democratic governance. It engages various branches of governance, organizing electoral processes and mobilization efforts. The TEU addresses classifications of rights and obligations, including the prohibition of circumvention of EU laws. It also factors in the necessity for prudential measures in financial settlements and the reclassification of policies affecting member states. By pledging adherence to democratic principles, the TEU ensures that elections are conducted fairly, thereby reinforcing the foundations of democracy within the EU.",
