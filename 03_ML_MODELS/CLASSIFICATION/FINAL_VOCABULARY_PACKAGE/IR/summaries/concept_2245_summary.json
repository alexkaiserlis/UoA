  "summary": "The concept of \"regional parliament\" refers to legislative bodies established within specific regions of a Member State in the European Union. These parliaments possess devolved powers to enact laws and regulations pertinent to regional governance, thereby enhancing local autonomy. Regional parliaments play a crucial role in the multi-level governance structure of the EU, facilitating representation and participation in the legislative process at a regional level. They contribute to the democratic legitimacy of decision-making by allowing regional interests to be articulated within the broader EU framework. This concept underscores the importance of subsidiarity in EU law, ensuring that decisions are made as closely as possible to the citizens affected.",
