  "summary": "\"Picture synthesis\" refers to the process of generating images through advanced information technology and data processing techniques. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is crucial for enhancing security measures at airports, where screeners utilize virtual projections to examine baggage and identify potential threats. Regulators emphasize the importance of precise image quality and standards to ensure that equipment performs correctly, reflecting the developments in aviation technology. Regular reviews of these systems are necessary to inform manufacturers and enhance familiarity with best practices. By projecting enlarged images, authorities can circumvent misused equipment, thus maintaining a secure environment for passengers.",
