  "summary": "The term \"intercontinental missile\" refers to a sophisticated category of ballistic missile capable of delivering payloads over long distances, typically exceeding 5,500 kilometers. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, intercontinental missiles are subject to stringent controls under various treaties and agreements aimed at non-proliferation and disarmament. The EU actively engages in discussions regarding arms control, emphasizing the need for transparency and accountability in the development and deployment of such defense systems. This concept is crucial for maintaining regional stability and ensuring compliance with international law, particularly in relation to security and defense policies.",
