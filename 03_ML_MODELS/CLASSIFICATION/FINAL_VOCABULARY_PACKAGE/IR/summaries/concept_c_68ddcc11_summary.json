  "summary": "The \"sharing economy,\" also referred to as the \"collaborative economy,\" represents a transformative economic structure within the European Union. This concept encompasses various business models that facilitate peer-to-peer exchanges of goods and services, often leveraging digital platforms. In the EU regulatory context, the collaborative economy raises significant legal considerations, including consumer protection, taxation, and labor rights. Regulatory frameworks aim to balance innovation with the safeguarding of public interests. As the EU continues to develop policies addressing the collaborative economy, understanding its implications on market dynamics and regulatory compliance becomes essential for stakeholders involved in this evolving sector.",
