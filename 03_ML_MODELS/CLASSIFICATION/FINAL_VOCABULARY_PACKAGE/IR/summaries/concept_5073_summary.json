  "summary": "Butter oil, categorized under processed agricultural produce (6016), refers to anhydrous milk fat derived from butter, often utilized in various food products and industrial applications. In the context of EU regulations, butteroil is subject to specific standards to ensure quality and safety for consumers. Misunderstandings regarding its composition, such as the presence of sitosterol and stigmasterol, can lead to logistical challenges in tendering processes. Henceforth, accurate labeling and documentation are crucial for the mobilization of butter oil across EU markets. Tenders for butter oil must describe the product precisely, ensuring that recipients are aware of the resultant fat content and its intended use in outlets. Regular audits and routine checks are necessary to maintain compliance with EU regulations, preventing any derogate practices in the distribution of this commodity.",
