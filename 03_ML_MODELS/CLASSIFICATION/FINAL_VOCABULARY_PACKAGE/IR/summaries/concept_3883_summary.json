  "summary": "The concept of \"paperboard\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to a lightweight, bonded material primarily produced from lignin and cellulose through pulping processes. It subsumes various types, including kraftboard and coated paperboard, which may exhibit decorative or embossed features. Paperboard can be classified into rectangular or square panels, often reinforced with layers of polyethylene or polystyrene for enhanced durability. The material is frequently used in packaging, where its thickness and structural integrity are critical. Additionally, paperboard may be treated with inorganic compounds like kaolin or sulphate to achieve specific properties, such as bleached or coloured finishes, making it versatile for graphic applications.",
