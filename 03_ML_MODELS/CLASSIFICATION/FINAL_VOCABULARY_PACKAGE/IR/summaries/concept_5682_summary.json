  "summary": "The concept of \"market-based instrument for environmental policymaking,\" also referred to as \"economic instrument for the environment,\" is pivotal in EU regulatory frameworks aimed at promoting sustainable development. These instruments leverage market mechanisms to incentivize environmentally beneficial practices, thereby aligning economic activities with ecological objectives. Examples include carbon trading schemes and environmental taxes, which aim to internalize environmental costs and encourage resource efficiency. The EU employs these instruments to achieve its environmental policy goals, facilitating compliance with directives and regulations while fostering innovation in green technologies. This redirect highlights the preferred term's broader application in EU environmental legislation.",
