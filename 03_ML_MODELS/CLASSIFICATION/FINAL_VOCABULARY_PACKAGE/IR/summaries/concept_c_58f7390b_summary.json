  "summary": "Maladministration refers to the improper or inefficient execution of public administration duties, particularly within the context of the European Union's executive power and public service. It encompasses failures in decision-making processes, lack of transparency, and inadequate service delivery that undermine the principles of good governance. The EU has established mechanisms, such as the European Ombudsman, to address complaints regarding maladministration, ensuring accountability and adherence to regulatory standards. By promoting effective administrative practices, the EU aims to enhance public trust and uphold the rule of law, thereby reinforcing the integrity of its institutions and the overall functioning of the public service.",
