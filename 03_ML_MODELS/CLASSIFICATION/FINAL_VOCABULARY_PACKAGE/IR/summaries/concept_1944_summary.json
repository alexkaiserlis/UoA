  "summary": "The concept of \"nuclear missile,\" categorized under defence, is a redirect to the preferred term \"missile.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, missiles, particularly those with nuclear capabilities, are subject to stringent controls and oversight due to their potential implications for international security and non-proliferation treaties. The EU's regulatory approach emphasizes the importance of disarmament and the prevention of the spread of such weapons. This reflects the EU's commitment to maintaining peace and stability within its member states and globally, aligning with broader international efforts to mitigate the risks associated with nuclear armaments.",
