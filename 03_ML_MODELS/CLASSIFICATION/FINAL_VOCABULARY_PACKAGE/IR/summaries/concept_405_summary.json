  "summary": "Depopulation refers to the significant decline in a population's size, often resulting from factors such as emigration, low birth rates, and aging demographics. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, depopulation poses challenges for regional development, social cohesion, and economic sustainability. The EU has initiated various policies aimed at addressing the implications of depopulation, particularly in rural areas facing demographic decline. These initiatives focus on promoting demographic renewal, enhancing migration policies, and fostering economic opportunities to counteract the adverse effects of depopulation. Understanding this concept is crucial for effective policy formulation and implementation within the EU's demographic landscape.",
