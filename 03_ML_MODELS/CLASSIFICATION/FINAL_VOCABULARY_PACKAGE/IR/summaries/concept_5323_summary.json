  "summary": "The concept of \"twinning\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to a collaborative mechanism aimed at enhancing the administrative capacity of public institutions in candidate and partner countries. This process typically involves pairing a governmental institution from an EU member state with a counterpart in a non-EU country to facilitate knowledge transfer, best practices, and institutional strengthening. Twinning projects are often funded by the EU and are integral to the accession process, ensuring that aspiring members align with EU standards in social affairs, governance, and regulatory compliance. This concept underscores the EU's commitment to fostering democratic values and effective governance in its neighboring regions.",
