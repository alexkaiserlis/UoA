  "summary": "The concept of \"underground ecosystem\" pertains to the intricate biological and geological systems existing beneath the Earth's surface, which play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity and environmental stability. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, understanding these ecosystems is essential for the formulation of policies aimed at environmental protection and sustainable development. The EU's commitment to the European Green Deal emphasizes the preservation of natural habitats, including underground ecosystems, to combat climate change and promote ecological resilience. Effective regulation requires comprehensive assessments of these subterranean environments to ensure their conservation and sustainable management, aligning with broader EU environmental objectives.",
