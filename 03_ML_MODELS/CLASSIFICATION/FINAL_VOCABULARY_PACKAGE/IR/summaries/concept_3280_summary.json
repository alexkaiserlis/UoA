  "summary": "The concept of \"university-working life relations,\" which is a redirect to the preferred term \"school-working life relations,\" pertains to the integration of educational institutions with the labor market within the EU regulatory framework. This relationship is crucial for fostering employability and ensuring that academic curricula align with the evolving demands of the workforce. EU legal documents emphasize the importance of collaboration between universities and industries to enhance practical training, internships, and job placements.
