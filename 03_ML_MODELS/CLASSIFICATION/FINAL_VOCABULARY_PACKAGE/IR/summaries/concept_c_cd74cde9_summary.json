  "summary": "Economic coercion refers to the use of economic pressure by a state or entity to influence the actions or decisions of another state or entity, often in the context of international relations. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, economic coercion is scrutinized under various treaties and regulations that aim to uphold fair competition and protect member states from undue influence. The EU seeks to address instances of economic coercion through its external action policies, promoting a rules-based international order. This concept is crucial for understanding the dynamics of trade relations and the legal mechanisms available to counteract coercive practices that undermine sovereignty and economic stability.",
