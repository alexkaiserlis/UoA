  "summary": "The concept of \"architecture\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework encompasses a broad spectrum of cultural and artistic expressions. It is crucial in discussions about urban planning and heritage protection, as seen in cases involving figures like Zandvoort and Fennema. Architectural regulations often address redundancies in design and promote smart integration of historical elements, as highlighted by experts such as Lillis and Keating. The EU's commitment to architectural excellence is evident in initiatives that support architects like Sheridan and Finch, fostering globalisation while respecting local traditions. This regulatory landscape ensures that architectural practices, including those nominated for prestigious awards, align with EU cultural policies, thus reinforcing the significance of architecture in societal development.",
