  "summary": "The term \"shipyard,\" as a redirect to \"shipbuilding,\" encompasses the essential activities and facilities involved in constructing vessels within the EU's mechanical engineering sector. Shipyards, such as those in Dunkerque and Toulon, play a pivotal role in the maritime economy, often linked to regional centers like Vegesack and Pontevedra. Regulatory frameworks govern these shipyards, ensuring compliance with safety and environmental standards. Notable examples include the interventionist policies aimed at revitalizing orderbooks in regions like Middlesborough and Hemiksem. The shipbuilding industry, represented by entities like Astano and Izar, is crucial for innovation and competitiveness, contributing to the EU's strategic maritime objectives.",
