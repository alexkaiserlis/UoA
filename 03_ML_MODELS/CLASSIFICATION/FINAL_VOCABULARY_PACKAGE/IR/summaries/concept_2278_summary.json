  "summary": "The concept of \"literary heritage,\" redirected to \"cultural heritage,\" encompasses a kaleidoscope of artistic expressions that form the foundation of diverse cultures within the EU. This heritage is crucial for enhancing accessibility to cultural assets, particularly through digitisation initiatives that allow unhindered access to libraries and online resources. The EU's regulatory framework assigns competences for the preservation and attribution of these sites, ensuring their protection against misuse. As a flagship agenda, the EU invites specialists to evaluate the advisability of various preservation strategies, delivering a sharp focus on the importance of cultural domains in humanitarian contexts, such as in Syria. The ordination of cultural heritage sites reflects a commitment to safeguarding these invaluable assets for future generations.",
