  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the term \"undifferentiated cell\" is synonymous with \"stem cell,\" which serves as the preferred term for this concept. Stem cells are unique biological entities capable of differentiating into various cell types, making them pivotal in regenerative medicine and therapeutic applications. The EU has established stringent regulations governing the research, use, and ethical considerations surrounding stem cells, particularly in relation to their sourcing and application in clinical trials. These regulations aim to ensure the protection of human rights while fostering innovation in natural and applied sciences, particularly in biomedicine and biotechnology.",
