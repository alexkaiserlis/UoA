  "summary": "The \"resolution of parliament\" refers to formal expressions of the European Parliament's stance on various issues, including legislative proposals, policy matters, or specific events. These resolutions serve as instruments of political accountability and influence, allowing the Parliament to articulate its position and recommendations to other EU institutions, member states, and the public. While not legally binding, they reflect the collective will of the Parliament and can shape the legislative agenda. Resolutions often emerge from debates, committee reports, or inquiries, underscoring the Parliament's role in democratic governance and its commitment to transparency and engagement in the EU regulatory framework.",
