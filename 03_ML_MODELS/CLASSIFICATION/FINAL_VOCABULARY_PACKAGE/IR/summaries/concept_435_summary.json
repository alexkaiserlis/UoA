  "summary": "The concept of \"North-South relations\" encompasses the complex interactions between developed and developing regions, particularly in the context of international affairs. Within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these relations are crucial for addressing issues such as drug trafficking and the systematic abuse of psychotropic substances. The EU endorses conventions aimed at curbing illicit drug trade, which often derives from poverty-stricken areas. Enhanced cooperation with partners like Sri Lanka focuses on combating the trafficking of narcotic precursors and fostering lawful economic development. These efforts aim to break down detrimental societal impacts, promote gradual attainment of universal goals, and support institutional frameworks that address addiction and revenue laundering.",
