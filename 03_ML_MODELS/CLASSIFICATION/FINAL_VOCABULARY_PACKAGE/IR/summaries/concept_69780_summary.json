  "summary": "The concept of \"child development\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses the holistic progression of childrenâ€™s physical, emotional, and cognitive growth. It is integral to various EU policies aimed at safeguarding children's rights and promoting their well-being. The EU emphasizes the importance of early childhood education, healthcare access, and social inclusion as critical components of child development. Regulatory instruments, such as the European Pillar of Social Rights, advocate for measures that ensure a nurturing environment conducive to optimal child development. This concept is essential for formulating effective policies that address the diverse needs of children across member states.",
