  "summary": "The \"fixed party list\" is a crucial concept within the electoral procedure and voting framework of the European Union. It refers to a voting system where political parties present a predetermined list of candidates, and voters select a party rather than individual candidates. This system ensures proportional representation and enhances party accountability in legislative elections. The fixed party list mechanism is employed in various EU member states, influencing the composition of the European Parliament. By establishing a clear structure for candidate selection, it facilitates the electoral process while promoting democratic engagement among citizens, thereby reinforcing the legitimacy of EU governance.",
