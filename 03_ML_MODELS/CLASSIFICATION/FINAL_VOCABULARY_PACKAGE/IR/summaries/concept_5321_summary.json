  "summary": "The term \"mercenary\" refers to individuals who engage in armed conflict primarily for personal gain rather than for national or ideological reasons. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the use of mercenaries raises significant concerns regarding compliance with international humanitarian law and the principles of legitimate defense. The EU has established regulations to address the recruitment and deployment of mercenaries, emphasizing the need for accountability and oversight. These measures aim to prevent the proliferation of private military contractors that may undermine state sovereignty and contribute to instability in conflict zones. The EU's approach reflects a commitment to uphold human rights and maintain peace.",
