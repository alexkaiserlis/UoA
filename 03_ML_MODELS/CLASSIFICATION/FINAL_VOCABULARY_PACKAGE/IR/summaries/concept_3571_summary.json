  "summary": "The concept of \"trade union election\" pertains to the democratic process through which members of a trade union select their representatives. In the context of EU labour law and labour relations, these elections are governed by various directives and regulations that ensure fair representation and adherence to democratic principles. Trade union elections are crucial for maintaining the integrity of collective bargaining processes and safeguarding workers' rights. The EU promotes standards that facilitate transparent electoral procedures, thereby enhancing the legitimacy of trade unions as representatives of the workforce. This concept is integral to fostering social dialogue and improving labour relations across member states.",
