  "summary": "The term \"small and medium-sized undertakings\" (SMUs) is a redirect to \"small and medium-sized enterprises\" (SMEs), which are pivotal in the European Union's economic landscape. These entities, characterized by their independent operations and varying sizes, play a crucial role in fostering innovation and job creation. The EU's regulatory framework, including initiatives like COSME and ECIP, aims to support SMEs in their transnationally oriented activities, promoting internationalization and Europeanization. By unlocking potential in nascent sectors such as biotech, SMEs are integral to achieving economic growth. Their hallmarks include adaptability and resilience, which are essential in an increasingly competitive environment, ensuring they are not overstated in their contributions to the economy.",
