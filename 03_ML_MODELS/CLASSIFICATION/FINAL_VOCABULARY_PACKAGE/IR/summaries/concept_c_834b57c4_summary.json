  "summary": "The term \"shadow financial system,\" which redirects to \"shadow banking,\" refers to non-bank financial intermediaries that provide services similar to traditional banks but operate outside regulatory frameworks. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, shadow banking poses challenges for the free movement of capital, as it may facilitate risk-taking without adequate oversight. The EU has recognized the need to address the implications of shadow banking on financial stability and investor protection. Regulatory measures aim to enhance transparency and mitigate systemic risks associated with these entities, ensuring a more resilient financial system while preserving the integrity of capital markets.",
