  "summary": "Multilateral surveillance is a crucial mechanism within the EU's regulatory framework, aimed at ensuring adherence to macroeconomic fundamentals among member states. This process involves rigorous assessments of economic outlooks, identifying potential misalignments and divergences that may lead to unwarranted deficits or overshooting of projections. By outlining a credible path for fiscal policies, multilateral surveillance invites member states to join efforts in reorienting their economic strategies. It addresses pressures arising from expansionary spending and borrowing, aiming to diminish slippage in compliance. The cyclical nature of economic performance necessitates regular revisions and evaluations, ensuring that shortfalls are promptly addressed and that member states remain committed to collective stability.",
