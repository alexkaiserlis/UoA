  "summary": "Return migration refers to the process whereby individuals, often migrants or refugees, return to their country of origin after residing abroad. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, returnees may include those who have been formally resettled or who are returning voluntarily or involuntarily. The EU emphasizes the importance of readmission agreements to facilitate this process, curbing illegal immigration and ensuring that returning individuals are treated with dignity. The integration of returnees into their home countries is crucial, as it involves addressing their citizenship, residency, and experiences abroad. Various initiatives, including the Seville and Thessaloniki processes, aim to formalise and accelerate return migration, enhancing cooperation among member states.",
