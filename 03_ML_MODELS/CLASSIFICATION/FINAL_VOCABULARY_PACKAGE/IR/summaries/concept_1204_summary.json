  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"seaweed,\" a redirect term for \"algae,\" encompasses various species such as eucheuma and padina, which are significant in biosciences and dietary applications. Algae are recognized for their proteinous content and essential nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids like docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and vitamins, which are advantageous for physiological health. Regulatory legislations address the harvesting and processing of these marine resources, ensuring sustainable practices. The incorporation of algae into diets can alleviate nutritional deficiencies, while their use in seasoning and cooking enhances food quality. Thus, the EU promotes the utilization of seaweeds to drive health benefits and innovation in food products.",
