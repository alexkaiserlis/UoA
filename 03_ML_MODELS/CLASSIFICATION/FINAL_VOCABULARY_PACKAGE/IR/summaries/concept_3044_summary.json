  "summary": "A \"plebiscite\" refers to a direct vote in which an electorate is invited to decide on a specific legislative proposal or constitutional amendment, often reflecting the will of the people on significant national issues. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, plebiscites may serve as a mechanism for gauging public opinion on matters such as EU membership or treaty changes. While not a formal part of EU electoral procedures, plebiscites can influence the democratic legitimacy of EU decisions. Their outcomes may impact national policies and the relationship between member states and EU institutions, underscoring the importance of public engagement in governance.",
