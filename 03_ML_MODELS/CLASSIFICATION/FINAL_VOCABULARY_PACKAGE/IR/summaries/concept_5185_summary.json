  "summary": "Television co-production, also referred to as audiovisual co-production, is a significant concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, facilitating cultural exchanges and cooperation among member states. This process involves multiple parties agreeing to jointly produce audiovisual content, thereby promoting regional diversity and enhancing local productions. Under various schemes, co-productions benefit from provisions that allow for the extension of funding and resources, ensuring that respective obligations are met. The intention is to create a favourable environment for the signing of agreements that set out the competences and responsibilities of each party. Such collaborations can affect domestic markets and contribute to the cultural landscape, provided they adhere to established protocols and guidelines.",
