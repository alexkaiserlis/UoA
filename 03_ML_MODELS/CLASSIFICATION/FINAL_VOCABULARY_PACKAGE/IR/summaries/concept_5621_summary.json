  "summary": "A \"non-secular State\" refers to a political framework where the government is closely intertwined with religious institutions, often leading to the establishment of laws and policies influenced by religious doctrines. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, this concept raises significant considerations regarding the principles of secularism, individual rights, and the separation of church and state. Non-secular states may challenge the EU's commitment to fundamental rights and freedoms, particularly in areas such as freedom of expression and equality before the law. Understanding this concept is crucial for assessing the compatibility of national laws with EU standards and values.",
