  "summary": "The concept of \"land management,\" categorized under the cultivation of agricultural land, is redirected to the preferred term \"land governance\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Land governance encompasses the policies, regulations, and practices that oversee land use and management, ensuring sustainable agricultural development. It plays a crucial role in addressing issues such as land tenure security, environmental protection, and resource allocation. Effective land governance is essential for achieving the EU's agricultural objectives, promoting rural development, and enhancing food security. This concept is pivotal in shaping EU policies that align with sustainable development goals and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).",
