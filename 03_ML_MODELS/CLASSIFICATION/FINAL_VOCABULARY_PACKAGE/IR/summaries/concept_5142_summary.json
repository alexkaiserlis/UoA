  "summary": "In the context of EU criminal law, \"repentance\" refers to a legal concept whereby an individual expresses remorse for their criminal actions, potentially influencing judicial outcomes. This notion can be pivotal in mitigating penalties or facilitating rehabilitation. Within EU regulatory frameworks, the acknowledgment of repentance may be considered during sentencing or as part of restorative justice initiatives. Although not explicitly defined in EU legislation, the principle aligns with broader human rights considerations, emphasizing the importance of personal accountability and moral reflection in the justice process. Thus, \"repentance\" serves as a significant factor in promoting rehabilitative justice across member states.",
