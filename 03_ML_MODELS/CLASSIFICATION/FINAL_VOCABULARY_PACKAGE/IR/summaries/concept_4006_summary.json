  "summary": "The concept of \"economic sector\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to distinct segments of the economy categorized by their specific activities, outputs, and contributions to the overall economic structure. This classification aids in the formulation of policies, regulations, and statistical analyses that support economic governance and development. Understanding various economic sectors is crucial for implementing EU initiatives aimed at enhancing competitiveness, ensuring sustainable development, and promoting cohesion among member states. By delineating economic sectors, the EU can effectively address sector-specific challenges and opportunities, thereby fostering a more integrated and resilient economic landscape across the Union.",
