  "summary": "A \"territorial enclave\" refers to a geographically distinct area, often surrounded by a different jurisdiction, which can create unique legal and regulatory challenges within the EU framework. For instance, the Kaliningrad enclave, bordered by Poland and Lithuania, exemplifies how such regions can affect traffic and interchange between neighbouring states. Inhabitants of enclaves may experience barriers to mobility and access to services, necessitating enhanced facilitations under EU law. The Schengen Agreement aims to preserve free movement, yet enclaves can complicate this by artificially dividing districts. Addressing these issues requires a strategic roadmap that respects the principles of subsidiarity and cultural diversity, ensuring that residents enjoy their rights without abuse.",
