  "summary": "\"Regional investment\" refers to the allocation of financial resources aimed at promoting economic development within specific geographical areas in the European Union. This concept is crucial for achieving cohesion among member states, particularly in less developed regions. EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such as the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), facilitate regional investment by providing funding and support for infrastructure projects, innovation, and job creation. The objective is to enhance competitiveness, foster sustainable growth, and reduce disparities across regions. By strategically directing investments, the EU aims to stimulate economic activity and improve living standards in targeted areas.",
