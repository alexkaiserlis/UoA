  "summary": "Stagflation, a term often redirected to \"inflation,\" denotes a complex economic condition characterized by simultaneous inflation and stagnation. In the EU regulatory context, it poses significant challenges for monetary policy, particularly for the European Central Bank (ECB), which must navigate tensions between inflationary pressures and economic growth. The methodologies for measuring inflation, such as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), utilize weightings based on consumer expenditure classifications (COICOP) to ensure accuracy. During stagflation, indices may reflect variability due to cyclical fluctuations, complicating the abrogation of ineffective policies. The EU's perseverance in addressing deficits and encouraging economic equilibrium is crucial for mitigating the adverse effects of stagflation on member states.",
