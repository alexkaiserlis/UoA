  "summary": "\"Discrimination based on age,\" commonly referred to as \"age discrimination,\" is a significant concept within the framework of EU rights and freedoms. This form of discrimination occurs when individuals are treated unfavorably due to their age, impacting various aspects of life, including employment, education, and access to services. The EU has established legal instruments, such as the Employment Equality Directive, to combat age discrimination and promote equal treatment. This concept underscores the EU's commitment to safeguarding human rights and ensuring that all individuals, regardless of age, enjoy equal opportunities and protection under the law.",
