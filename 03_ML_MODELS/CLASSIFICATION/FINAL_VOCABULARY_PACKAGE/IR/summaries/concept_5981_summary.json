  "summary": "Structural unemployment refers to a persistent form of unemployment arising from fundamental shifts in the economy, such as technological advancements or changes in consumer demand. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, structural unemployment poses significant challenges for labor market policies and social cohesion. The European Union seeks to address this issue through various initiatives, including the European Social Fund, which aims to enhance employability and facilitate workforce transitions. By understanding the causes and implications of structural unemployment, EU institutions can develop targeted strategies to mitigate its effects, ensuring a more resilient and adaptable labor market across member states.",
