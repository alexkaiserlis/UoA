  "summary": "The \"distribution of schools\" pertains to the strategic allocation and organization of educational institutions within the EU framework. This concept is crucial for ensuring equitable access to quality education across member states, aligning with EU policies on social inclusion and regional development. Regulatory documents emphasize the need for a balanced distribution of schools to address disparities in educational opportunities, particularly in underserved areas. Effective distribution is essential for fostering educational excellence and supporting the EU's broader objectives of cohesion and solidarity among its diverse populations. Thus, the distribution of schools plays a pivotal role in shaping educational policies within the EU.",
