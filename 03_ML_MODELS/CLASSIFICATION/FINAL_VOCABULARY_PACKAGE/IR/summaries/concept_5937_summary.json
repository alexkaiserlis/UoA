  "summary": "\"Transparency in decision-making\" within EU institutions emphasizes the importance of open dialogue and democratic processes. It strengthens citizens' confidence by ensuring that all relevant files and documents are accessible, thereby promoting accountability. The Aarhus Convention highlights the need for public participation and access to information, requiring institutions to provide clear modalities for transmitting decisions. This concept traditionally involves early engagement with applicants and stakeholders during meetings, guiding the delivery of policies. The continuous modification of transparency practices complements the EU's commitment to privacy and fosters closer relationships between departments and citizens, ultimately enhancing the democratic fabric of the Union.",
