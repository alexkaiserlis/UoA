It asserts that every individual and community has the inherent entitlement to participate in and benefit from economic, social, cultural, and political development. This right is intertwined with the principles of equality and non-discrimination, ensuring that development efforts are inclusive and equitable. The EU recognizes the right to development as essential for fostering sustainable growth and addressing global inequalities, thereby reinforcing its commitment to human dignity and social justice in its external relations and development policies.",
