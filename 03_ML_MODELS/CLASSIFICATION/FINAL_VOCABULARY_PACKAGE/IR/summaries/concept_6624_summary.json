  "summary": "The concept of \"maritime court\" pertains to specialized judicial bodies within the EU legal system that adjudicate cases related to maritime law. These courts address issues such as shipping disputes, maritime contracts, and environmental regulations affecting marine activities. The organization of the legal system in the EU recognizes the necessity for dedicated maritime courts to ensure the effective resolution of complex cases that involve international shipping and trade. By providing a structured framework for maritime litigation, these courts contribute to the harmonization of maritime law across member states, thereby facilitating smoother maritime operations and compliance with EU regulations.",
