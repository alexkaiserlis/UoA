  "summary": "The concept \"Republic of Iraq,\" redirected to the preferred term \"Iraq,\" encompasses a complex political geography relevant to EU legal and regulatory frameworks. The EU has historically engaged with Iraq, particularly post-Saddam Hussein, focusing on rebuilding and supporting democratic institutions. The EU's involvement includes condemning the invasion of Iraq and addressing the humanitarian crises that impair stability. Legal instruments, such as sanctions and cooperation agreements, often bind Iraqi ministries and corporations, while EUJUST missions aim to enhance rule of law. The coalition's efforts are underscored by demands for unconditional peace, with Iraq's relations with neighboring states like Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia being pivotal in regional stability.",
