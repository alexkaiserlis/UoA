  "summary": "The \"principle of communitisation\" refers to the legal framework within the European Union that facilitates the transfer of powers and responsibilities from member states to the EU institutions. This principle underpins the process of integrating national policies into a cohesive EU legal order, promoting uniformity and coherence in regulatory practices. It is particularly significant in areas such as environmental policy, where collective action is essential. By adhering to this principle, the EU aims to enhance cooperation among member states, ensuring that decisions reflect a shared commitment to common goals while respecting the sovereignty of individual nations.",
