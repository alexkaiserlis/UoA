  "summary": "The term \"profit-sharing cartel\" refers to a specific type of cartel arrangement where competing firms collude to divide markets or allocate customers, thereby stabilizing prices and sharing profits. In the context of EU competition law, such practices are strictly prohibited under Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which aims to promote fair competition and prevent anti-competitive behavior. This concept is a redirect to the broader term \"cartel,\" which encompasses various forms of collusion among businesses. The European Commission actively investigates and penalizes profit-sharing cartels to uphold market integrity and protect consumer interests.",
