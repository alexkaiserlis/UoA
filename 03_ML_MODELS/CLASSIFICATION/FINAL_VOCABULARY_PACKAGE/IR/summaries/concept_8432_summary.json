  "summary": "The concept of \"private bankruptcy,\" redirected to \"civil bankruptcy,\" pertains to the legal framework governing individual insolvency within the European Union. Civil bankruptcy is a critical aspect of the regulatory landscape, facilitating the orderly resolution of debts for individuals unable to meet their financial obligations. This process aims to balance the rights of creditors with the need for debtors to achieve a fresh start, thereby promoting economic stability. EU member states implement various legal provisions to harmonize civil bankruptcy procedures, ensuring consistency and fairness across jurisdictions while adhering to overarching EU financial regulations.",
