  "summary": "International responsibility is a fundamental principle in international law, particularly relevant to the European Union's legal framework. It pertains to the obligations of states and international organizations to ensure compliance with their international commitments. In the context of the EU, this concept underscores the accountability of member states and EU institutions for actions that breach international obligations, potentially leading to liability or reparations. This principle is crucial for maintaining the rule of law and fostering cooperative relations among states, as it establishes a legal basis for addressing grievances and enforcing compliance within the international community.",
