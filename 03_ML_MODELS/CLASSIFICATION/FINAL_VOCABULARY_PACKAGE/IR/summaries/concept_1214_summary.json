  "summary": "The term \"cold war\" refers to a prolonged period of geopolitical tension and ideological conflict, primarily between the Western bloc, led by the United States and NATO, and the Eastern bloc, led by the Soviet Union. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the implications of the cold war era are significant, influencing international security policies and diplomatic relations. The EU's approach to international security has evolved to address the legacy of the cold war, focusing on conflict prevention, crisis management, and the promotion of stability in Europe and beyond. This historical context informs current EU strategies in addressing contemporary security challenges.",
