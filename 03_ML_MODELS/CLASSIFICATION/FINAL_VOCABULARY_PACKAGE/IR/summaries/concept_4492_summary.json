  "summary": "The \"transfer of businesses\" concept in EU law pertains to the legal framework governing the transition of ownership from transferors to transferees. This regulatory mechanism is crucial in safeguarding employee rights during mergers and acquisitions, particularly in cases of insolvency or liquidation. It promotes employability and ensures that employees enjoy decent working conditions amidst economic pressures. Specificities of the transfer process include the anticipation of potential bankruptcies and the need for supportive measures to protect workers' rights. The legal provisions aim to prevent unequal treatment and dissuasive practices, thereby fostering adaptability in the workforce and enhancing the overall stability of societies.",
