  "summary": "Bilateralism, often redirected to \"bilateral relations,\" encompasses the legal frameworks governing interactions between two states, particularly within the EU context. It involves ongoing negotiations and consultations aimed at establishing agreements that authorise the import and export of goods, such as wines and cheese, between contracting parties. These bilateral agreements may include provisions for the adjustment of tariffs and preferences, addressing disruptions in trade. For instance, the EU may seek to authorise the import of Chilean wines, ensuring compliance with quality standards. Such bilateral arrangements are essential for facilitating trade, enhancing economic cooperation, and providing satisfactory solutions to arising issues in international affairs.",
