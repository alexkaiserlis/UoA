  "summary": "Ceuta is an autonomous city and a unique region of Spain, located on the northern coast of Africa, which is also part of the European Union. As a region of EU Member States, Ceuta is subject to EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning regional development, cross-border cooperation, and the application of EU law. Its geographical position influences its regulatory context, especially in relation to trade, migration, and security policies. The status of Ceuta as an outermost region necessitates specific considerations under EU regulations, fostering a distinct legal environment that aligns with broader EU objectives while addressing local needs.",
