  "summary": "The concept of \"early election\" pertains to the electoral procedure and voting mechanisms within the European Union's regulatory framework. An early election occurs when a legislative body, such as a national parliament, is dissolved prior to the end of its term, necessitating a new electoral process. This can arise from various political circumstances, including a loss of confidence in the government or significant political shifts. Early elections are governed by national laws, which must align with EU principles of democratic representation and electoral integrity. Such elections can impact the composition of the European Parliament and influence EU policy-making.",
