  "summary": "Austerity policy refers to a set of economic measures implemented by EU member states, primarily during financial crises, aimed at reducing government deficits through spending cuts, tax increases, and structural reforms. These policies are often mandated by EU regulations and agreements, particularly in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact, which seeks to ensure fiscal discipline among member states. Austerity measures can significantly impact social welfare systems and public services, leading to debates on their efficacy and social implications. The legal framework surrounding austerity policies is crucial for understanding their implementation and compliance within the EU's economic governance structure.",
