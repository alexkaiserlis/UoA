  "summary": "The \"monetary intervention mechanism,\" commonly referred to as the \"exchange-rate mechanism,\" is a regulatory framework within the EU designed to stabilize currency fluctuations among member states. This mechanism plays a crucial role in maintaining monetary stability and facilitating economic convergence, particularly for countries aspiring to adopt the euro. By allowing for coordinated interventions in foreign exchange markets, the mechanism aims to prevent excessive volatility in exchange rates, thereby fostering a conducive environment for trade and investment. Its implementation is governed by EU legal instruments that ensure compliance with monetary policy objectives, reinforcing the integrity of the Economic and Monetary Union.",
