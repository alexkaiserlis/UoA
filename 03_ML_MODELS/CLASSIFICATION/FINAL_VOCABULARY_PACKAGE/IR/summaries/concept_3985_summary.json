  "summary": "A \"court of arbitration\" refers to a specialized tribunal established to resolve disputes outside of traditional court systems, primarily through arbitration. In the context of the EU legal framework, these courts play a crucial role in facilitating the resolution of conflicts, particularly in commercial and international matters. They operate under specific rules and procedures agreed upon by the parties involved, ensuring a binding decision that is enforceable across member states. The use of courts of arbitration is significant in promoting legal certainty and efficiency, as they provide an alternative to lengthy litigation processes, thereby enhancing the overall organization of the legal system within the EU.",
