  "summary": "Industrial policy within the EU context refers to a strategic framework aimed at fostering the emergence of competitive industrial clusters and enhancing linkages among various sectors. It involves formulating a roadmap that addresses challenges such as sustainability and inflationary pressures while promoting equality and solidarity among stakeholders, including NGOs and academia. The EU's agenda emphasizes partnerships that facilitate predictable outcomes and faster innovation, particularly in upstream and downstream processes. By reviewing existing policies and discussing the advisability of new initiatives, the EU presidency aims to launch platforms that bring together diverse partners, including unions and industry makers, to contribute to a robust industrial landscape.",
