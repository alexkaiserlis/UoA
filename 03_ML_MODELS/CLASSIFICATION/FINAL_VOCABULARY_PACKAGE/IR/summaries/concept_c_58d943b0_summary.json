  "summary": "\"Age-sensitive aid\" refers to financial or technical assistance provided by the European Union that takes into account the specific needs and circumstances of different age groups. This concept is particularly relevant in the context of cooperation policy, where the EU aims to promote inclusive growth and social cohesion. By tailoring aid to address age-related challenges, such as youth unemployment or elderly care, the EU enhances the effectiveness of its support mechanisms. This approach aligns with broader regulatory frameworks that prioritize demographic considerations in policy-making, ensuring that all age groups benefit equitably from EU initiatives and resources.",
