  "summary": "Marxism, as a political framework, is a socio-economic theory that critiques capitalism and advocates for a classless society through the collective ownership of production means. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, Marxism influences discussions on social justice, economic equity, and labor rights. While not a dominant ideology within EU policymaking, its principles resonate in debates surrounding welfare policies and the regulation of labor markets. The EU's commitment to social cohesion and equitable growth can be seen as a response to Marxist critiques, aiming to balance market dynamics with the protection of vulnerable populations and the promotion of social rights.",
