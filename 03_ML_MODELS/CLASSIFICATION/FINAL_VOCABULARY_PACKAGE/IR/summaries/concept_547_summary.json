  "summary": "The \"right of repossession\" in the context of EU construction and town planning refers to the legal entitlement of a property owner or developer to reclaim possession of a property under specific circumstances, typically following a breach of contract or failure to comply with planning regulations. This right is crucial in ensuring compliance with EU directives on property rights and urban development. It serves as a regulatory mechanism to protect stakeholders' interests, allowing for the enforcement of contractual obligations and the maintenance of orderly urban development. The right of repossession is integral to the broader framework of property law within the EU, ensuring that construction practices adhere to established legal standards.",
