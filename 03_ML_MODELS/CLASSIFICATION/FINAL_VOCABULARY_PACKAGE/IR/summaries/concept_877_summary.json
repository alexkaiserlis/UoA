  "summary": "The term \"remand prison\" refers to a type of penal institution where individuals are held in custody while awaiting trial or the resolution of their legal proceedings. In the context of EU criminal law, remand prisons serve a critical function in ensuring that accused persons are detained securely, thereby upholding the integrity of the judicial process. The use of such facilities is governed by various EU regulations and directives aimed at safeguarding the rights of detainees, ensuring humane treatment, and preventing arbitrary detention. This concept is closely related to the preferred term \"penal institution,\" which encompasses all forms of correctional facilities within the EU legal framework.",
