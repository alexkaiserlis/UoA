  "summary": "The \"two-ballot voting system,\" also referred to as the \"double-ballot voting system,\" is a significant electoral procedure utilized in various EU member states to enhance democratic representation. This system allows voters to cast two distinct votes, typically for different candidates or parties, thereby facilitating a more nuanced expression of electoral preferences. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the double-ballot voting system is often discussed in relation to proportional representation and electoral fairness. Its implementation can influence legislative outcomes and voter engagement, making it a critical component of electoral law within the EU.",
