  "summary": "The concept of \"parliamentary law,\" categorized under \"sources and branches of the law,\" is a redirect to \"constitutional law,\" which encompasses the fundamental principles governing the structure and function of a state. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, constitutional law serves as a cornerstone, delineating the powers and responsibilities of EU institutions and member states. It ensures adherence to democratic principles and the rule of law, facilitating the legislative process within the European Parliament. Understanding parliamentary law is essential for interpreting the constitutional underpinnings that guide EU governance and legislative actions, thereby reinforcing the integrity of the legal system.",
