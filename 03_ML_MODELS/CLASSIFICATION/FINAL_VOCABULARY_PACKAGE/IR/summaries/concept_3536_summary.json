  "summary": "The concept of \"soil resources\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework encompasses the sustainable management and protection of soil as a vital natural environment asset. Soil resources are critical for biodiversity, agriculture, and ecosystem services, necessitating robust regulatory measures to prevent degradation and contamination. The EU's Soil Thematic Strategy aims to address challenges such as soil erosion, nutrient depletion, and pollution, promoting practices that enhance soil health. Legal instruments, including directives and regulations, establish standards for soil quality and conservation, ensuring that soil resources are preserved for future generations while supporting the EU's broader environmental objectives.",
