  "summary": "The \"restrictive-practice notification\" pertains to the obligation under EU competition law for businesses to inform the European Commission about agreements or practices that may restrict competition. This notification process is crucial for maintaining market integrity and preventing anti-competitive behavior, such as collusion or abuse of dominant positions. By submitting a restrictive-practice notification, companies seek legal clarity and potentially immunity from penalties, as the Commission assesses the impact of such practices on market dynamics. This mechanism underscores the EU's commitment to fostering fair competition while allowing businesses to operate within a regulated framework.",
