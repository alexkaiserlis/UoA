  "summary": "The concept of \"nuclear weapon\" falls under the EU's defence category, addressing issues of proliferation and international security. The EU actively engages in vigilance against entities contravening UNSC resolutions regarding the ownership and transportation of such weapons. This includes monitoring launches of ballistic missiles and brokering activities that may facilitate their development. The EU's regulatory framework aims to prevent the destruction of peace through strict controls on materials, including precious metals and aluminium used in weaponry. Furthermore, the EU condemns ventures that violate international norms, ensuring that sanctions are imposed on unissued or seized assets linked to nuclear proliferation, thereby promoting global stability.",
