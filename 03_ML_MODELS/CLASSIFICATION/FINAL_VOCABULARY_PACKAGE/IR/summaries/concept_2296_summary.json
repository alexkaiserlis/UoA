  "summary": "The concept of \"overseas countries and territories\" (OCTs) pertains to regions that, while associated with EU member states, are not part of the EU itself. These territories, such as Montserrat and Turks and Caicos, are characterized by unique topographies and socio-economic conditions. The EU's regulatory framework aims to support these regions through appropriations and specific programs, such as the STABEX system, which addresses agricultural challenges. The relationship between the EU and OCTs is profoundly significant, as it includes provisions for importes, notification processes, and the management of resources like yams and poultrymeat. The legal status of these territories allows for the implementation of tailored policies, ensuring that the leastdeveloped regions receive necessary support while fostering stability and development.",
