  "summary": "The \"war in Kashmir,\" redirected to the preferred term \"Kashmir question,\" pertains to a protracted territorial dispute primarily between India and Pakistan, with implications for international security. Within the EU legal and regulatory framework, the Kashmir question is relevant for discussions on human rights, conflict resolution, and diplomatic relations. The EU often emphasizes the need for peaceful dialogue and adherence to international law in addressing such conflicts. The situation in Kashmir raises concerns about regional stability and the potential for escalation, which are critical for the EU's foreign policy and security strategies in South Asia.",
