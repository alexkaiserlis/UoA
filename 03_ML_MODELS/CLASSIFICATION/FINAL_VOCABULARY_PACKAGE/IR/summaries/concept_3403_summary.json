  "summary": "Saint Kitts and Nevis, a federation in the Caribbean, is recognized in EU legal and regulatory contexts, particularly concerning its status as an overseas territory. The nation has achieved independence and is often mentioned in association with ACP (African, Caribbean, and Pacific) agreements. Recent provisions include simplified visa processes and waivers for certain nationals, facilitating travel and trade. The EU has negotiated protocols that establish tender practices for importing goods, including milk, from these territories. Ministers from Saint Kitts and Nevis are entitled to participate in discussions regarding conventions that affect their interests, thereby ensuring their voice is heard in relevant organizations.",
