  "summary": "The \"penal code\" is a fundamental legal instrument within the EU legal framework, delineating criminal offenses and corresponding penalties. It serves as a primary source of law, establishing the parameters of criminal liability and procedural norms. Each EU member state possesses its own penal code, reflecting national legal traditions while adhering to overarching EU principles, such as the protection of fundamental rights. The harmonization of penal codes across member states is essential for fostering mutual recognition of judicial decisions and enhancing cooperation in criminal matters, thereby contributing to the integrity of the EU's area of freedom, security, and justice.",
