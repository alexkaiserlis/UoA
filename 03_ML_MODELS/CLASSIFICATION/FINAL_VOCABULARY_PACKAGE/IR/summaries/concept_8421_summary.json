  "summary": "\"Discursive democracy,\" a term redirecting to \"deliberative democracy,\" refers to a political framework emphasizing the importance of reasoned discourse in democratic processes. Within the EU legal and regulatory context, deliberative democracy advocates for inclusive dialogue among citizens, stakeholders, and policymakers to enhance legitimacy and accountability in decision-making. This approach fosters a participatory environment where diverse viewpoints are considered, thereby enriching the democratic fabric of the Union. By prioritizing deliberation, the EU aims to bridge gaps between governance and public opinion, ensuring that policies reflect collective reasoning and promote democratic engagement across member states.",
