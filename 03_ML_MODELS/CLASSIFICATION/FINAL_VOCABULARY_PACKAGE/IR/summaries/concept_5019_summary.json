  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"refreshment\" is redirected to \"non-alcoholic beverage,\" encompassing a range of products such as lemonade and cola. These beverages often contain preservatives like benzoates and sorbates, which are crucial for pasteurisation and maintaining quality. The regulatory framework emphasizes accurate naming to avoid ambiguous interpretations that could misinterpret product contents. Multinationals distributing these drinks must adhere to strict guidelines, ensuring that flavours and aromas do not degrade over time. The presence of caffeine and other powerful ingredients is regulated to prevent exceedence of safe consumption levels. Thus, the concept of refreshment is firmly anchored in the EU's comprehensive beverage regulations.",
