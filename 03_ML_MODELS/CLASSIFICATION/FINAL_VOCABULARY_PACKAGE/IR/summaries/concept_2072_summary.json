  "summary": "In the context of the European Union, a \"non-attached member\" refers to a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) who does not belong to any political group. These members operate independently, allowing them to express diverse viewpoints without the constraints of party affiliation. Non-attached members play a crucial role in the parliamentary process, contributing to debates and legislative initiatives while representing specific interests or constituencies. Their presence ensures a broader spectrum of opinions within the EU's legislative framework, fostering democratic engagement and enhancing the representational diversity essential for effective governance in the Union.",
