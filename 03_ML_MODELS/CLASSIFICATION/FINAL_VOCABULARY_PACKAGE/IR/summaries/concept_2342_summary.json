  "summary": "The concept of \"staff\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to personnel management and staff remuneration. It encompasses the appointment and selection of employees, including officials and auditors, ensuring compliance with regulations that guarantee fair salaries and allowances. The realisation of effective personnel management involves advanced programming and computerised systems for traceability of remuneration processes. Additionally, the concept addresses overheads associated with staffing, such as funding for training and development. In the context of agencies like Europol, the management of staff is crucial for operational efficiency, justifying the need for a well-structured approach to personnel administration, including the adjustment of salaries and benefits.",
