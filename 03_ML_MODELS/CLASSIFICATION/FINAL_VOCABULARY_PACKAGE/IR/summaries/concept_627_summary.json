  "summary": "The concept of \"school abroad\" pertains to educational institutions located outside a student's home country, facilitating international learning experiences. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such schools are often governed by directives aimed at promoting educational mobility and enhancing cross-border cooperation in teaching. The EU encourages member states to recognize qualifications obtained at schools abroad, thereby fostering a more integrated educational landscape. This concept is crucial for initiatives like the Erasmus+ program, which supports student exchanges and promotes cultural understanding, aligning with the EU's broader objectives of enhancing educational standards and accessibility across Europe.",
