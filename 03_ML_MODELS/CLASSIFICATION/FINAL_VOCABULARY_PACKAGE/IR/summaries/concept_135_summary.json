  "summary": "Conservatism, within the EU political framework, embodies a legal and regulatory philosophy that emphasizes tradition, stability, and gradual reform. This ideology often influences the formulation of policies that prioritize the preservation of established norms and values, reflecting a cautious approach to legislative change. In the context of EU governance, conservatism can manifest in the resistance to rapid integration or the adoption of progressive measures that may disrupt societal cohesion. By advocating for incremental adjustments rather than radical transformations, conservative principles play a crucial role in shaping the EU's regulatory landscape, ensuring that reforms are aligned with historical precedents and cultural continuity.",
