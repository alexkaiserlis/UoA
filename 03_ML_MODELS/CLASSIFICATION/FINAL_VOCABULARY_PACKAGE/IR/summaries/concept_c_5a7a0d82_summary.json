  "summary": "The concept of \"business model\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to the structured approach that organizations adopt to create, deliver, and capture value. It encompasses the strategic components that define how a business operates, including revenue streams, customer segments, and value propositions. In the context of EU regulations, understanding diverse business models is crucial for compliance with directives on competition, consumer protection, and sustainability. The European Commission often assesses business models to ensure they align with EU policies promoting innovation and fair market practices, thereby fostering a competitive internal market while safeguarding consumer interests.",
