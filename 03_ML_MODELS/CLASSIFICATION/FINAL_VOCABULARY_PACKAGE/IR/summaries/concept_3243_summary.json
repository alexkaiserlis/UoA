  "summary": "Personal insurance refers to a category of insurance products designed to provide financial protection to individuals against various risks, including health issues, accidents, and life events. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, personal insurance is governed by directives such as the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) and Solvency II, which aim to enhance consumer protection and ensure the financial stability of insurers. These regulations mandate transparency in policy terms and conditions, as well as the obligation for insurers to conduct thorough risk assessments. Consequently, personal insurance plays a crucial role in safeguarding individual welfare within the EU's internal market.",
