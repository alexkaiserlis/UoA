  "summary": "The concept of \"nationality of legal persons\" pertains to the legal status and recognition of entities such as corporations and associations within the framework of international law, particularly in the context of the European Union. This concept is crucial for determining the rights and obligations of legal persons across member states, influencing their ability to engage in cross-border activities. Nationality affects jurisdiction, access to legal protections, and compliance with regulatory frameworks. In EU law, the nationality of legal persons is often linked to the principles of free movement and establishment, ensuring that entities can operate seamlessly within the internal market while adhering to national regulations.",
