  "summary": "The \"eurozone,\" more accurately referred to as the \"euro area,\" encompasses EU member states that have adopted the euro as their official currency. This monetary union is overseen by various regulatory bodies, ensuring macroprudential stability and addressing potential financial malfunctions. The euro area interlinks economies, pooling resources and facilitating deeper economic integration. Regulatory frameworks, such as the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), impose conditionality on fiscal policies, while oversight mechanisms, including the European Central Bank (ECB), monitor compliance. Recent refinements in simulations and vigilance practices have aimed to enhance resilience against economic spillovers, ensuring that member states, including the Baltics, maintain fiscal discipline and equitable growth.",
