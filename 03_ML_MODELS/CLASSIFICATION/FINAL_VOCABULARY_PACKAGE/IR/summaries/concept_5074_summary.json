  "summary": "The \"shadow cabinet\" refers to a group of senior opposition members in the European Union who scrutinize and challenge the policies of the ruling government. This concept plays a crucial role in the political landscape, ensuring accountability and transparency within EU governance. The shadow cabinet operates by proposing alternative policies and holding the government to account, thereby enhancing democratic processes. While not formally recognized in EU legal frameworks, its influence is significant in shaping public discourse and policy debates. The existence of a shadow cabinet underscores the importance of political pluralism and the role of opposition in safeguarding democratic integrity within the EU.",
