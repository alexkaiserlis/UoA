  "summary": "The concept of \"disclosure of information\" pertains to the legal obligation within EU regulations for entities to transparently share relevant data, thereby preventing issues such as overproduction or splintering of information. This practice is pivotal in sectors like aquacultural and zootechnic industries, where stakeholders must be empowered to make informed decisions. The effectiveness of such disclosures is evaluated through frameworks established by the FATF, ensuring compliance with standards. Additionally, the use of depositories for sensitive data, such as mercurous compounds or dichloroethane, underscores the importance of safeguarding information. Ultimately, the regulation aims to create a borderless environment for information sharing while maintaining accountability among representatives and stakeholders.",
