  "summary": "Populism, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to a political approach that seeks to represent the interests of ordinary citizens against the perceived elite. It often manifests in movements that challenge established political structures and advocate for direct democracy. In EU governance, populism can influence policy-making and electoral dynamics, prompting regulatory responses to address concerns about democratic legitimacy and social cohesion. The rise of populist parties has necessitated a reevaluation of traditional political paradigms, emphasizing the need for inclusive dialogue and regulatory measures that uphold democratic values while addressing the grievances of the populace.",
