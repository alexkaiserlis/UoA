  "summary": "The concept of \"immigration\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses the interdependency of member states in managing the movement of individuals across borders. It involves the formalisation of procedures for resettlement, asylum applications, and the issuance of visas, which are critical for integrating immigrants into society. The EU's codecision process plays a pivotal role in shaping immigration policies, ensuring accessibility and fairness. Key documents, such as the Seville and Nice declarations, outline the intentions of member states to enhance cooperation. Courts and tribunals interpret immigration laws, while initiatives like the Hague and Thessaloniki processes aim to bridge gaps and improve experiences for those residing abroad. Publicity and dissemination of information are essential for ensuring that immigration policies are adequately communicated and understood.",
