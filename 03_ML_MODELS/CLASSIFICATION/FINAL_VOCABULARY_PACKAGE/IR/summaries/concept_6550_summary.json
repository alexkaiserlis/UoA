  "summary": "The \"integration of people with disabilities\" is a pivotal concept within EU social affairs, emphasizing the necessity for inclusive policies that ensure equal participation in society. EU legal frameworks, such as the European Disability Strategy, mandate member states to adopt measures that promote accessibility, non-discrimination, and social inclusion. This integration is not merely a social imperative but a legal obligation under various EU directives, including the Employment Equality Directive and the Accessibility Act. By fostering an environment that supports the integration of people with disabilities, the EU aims to enhance their autonomy and facilitate their full participation in economic and social life.",
