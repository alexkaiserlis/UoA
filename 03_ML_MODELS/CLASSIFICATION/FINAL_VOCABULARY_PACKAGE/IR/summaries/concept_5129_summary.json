  "summary": "The \"opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee\" (ESC opinion) is a distinctive legal instrument within EU law, providing a platform for various groupings to express views on proposed legislation. These opinions can expose instances of potential illegality or compatibility with existing regulations, thereby fostering lawful practices. The ESC intervenes in matters affecting productivity and rationality, assessing whether proposed measures might distort market conditions or impose undue restrictions. While not binding, these opinions hold significant weight in the legislative process, sometimes retroactively influencing decisions. They serve as a means to ascertain the legality of actions and ensure that member states do not derogate from established norms.",
