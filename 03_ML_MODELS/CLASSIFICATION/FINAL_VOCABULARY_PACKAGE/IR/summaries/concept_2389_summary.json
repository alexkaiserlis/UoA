  "summary": "The concept of \"plain\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to areas of natural environment management, particularly in relation to land use and biodiversity conservation. In legal texts, \"plain\" may refer to open, flat landscapes that are significant for ecological balance and habitat preservation. Such areas often require specific regulatory measures to protect against urbanization and environmental degradation. The EU's environmental policies emphasize the importance of maintaining these natural spaces, ensuring that they remain integral to the ecological network. This concept is crucial for understanding land management strategies and their implications for sustainable development within the EU.",
