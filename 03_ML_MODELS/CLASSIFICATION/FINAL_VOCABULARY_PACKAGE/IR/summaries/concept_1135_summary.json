  "summary": "The concept of \"wastage\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the inefficient use or loss of resources, particularly in relation to consumption patterns. It is critical in discussions surrounding sustainability, resource management, and environmental protection. The EU has established various directives aimed at minimizing wastage, promoting circular economy principles, and ensuring that consumption aligns with environmental objectives. By addressing wastage, the EU seeks to enhance efficiency and reduce the ecological footprint of consumption practices, thereby contributing to broader goals of sustainability and responsible resource utilization across member states.",
