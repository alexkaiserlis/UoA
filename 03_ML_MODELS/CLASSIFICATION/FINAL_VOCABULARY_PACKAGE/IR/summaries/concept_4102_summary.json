  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the term \"national song\" is recognized as a redirect to the preferred term \"anthem.\" Anthems serve as significant cultural symbols, representing the identity and values of a nation. Within EU documents, anthems may be referenced in discussions surrounding cultural heritage, national pride, and the promotion of unity among member states. While the concept of a national song encompasses various musical forms, the legal implications often pertain to issues of intellectual property, national representation, and cultural diplomacy. Understanding this relationship is essential for effective engagement in cultural policy and EU integration efforts.",
