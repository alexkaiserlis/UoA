  "summary": "The concept of a \"secular State\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework refers to a political entity that maintains a clear separation between religious institutions and state governance. This principle ensures that laws and policies are formulated without religious influence, promoting pluralism and equality among diverse belief systems. In the context of EU law, a secular State upholds fundamental rights, including freedom of religion and non-discrimination, which are enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This framework fosters democratic governance and social cohesion, essential for the functioning of a diverse and integrated European society.",
