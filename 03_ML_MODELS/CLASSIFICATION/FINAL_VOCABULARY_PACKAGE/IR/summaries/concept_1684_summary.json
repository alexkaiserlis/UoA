  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"shipment,\" redirected to the preferred term \"delivery,\" encompasses the transfer of goods from vendors to consignees. This process can involve complex regulations, particularly when addressing issues of undervaluation or unregistered shipments. Regulatory frameworks often penalizing non-compliance ensure that shipments are accurately documented, preventing false declarations. The delivery process may also require communication through telecopy or telegrams, especially in regions like Bamako or Douala. Furthermore, the shipment of goods, such as yoghurts or olivepomace, must adhere to standards that guarantee safety and quality, reflecting the EU's commitment to consumer protection and equalisation across member states.",
