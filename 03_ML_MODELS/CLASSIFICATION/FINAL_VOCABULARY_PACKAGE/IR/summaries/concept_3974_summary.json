  "summary": "The \"rights of the defence\" is a fundamental principle within EU law, ensuring that individuals accused of a violation are afforded fair treatment throughout legal proceedings. This concept is enshrined in various regulatory frameworks, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which guarantees the right to a fair trial. The rights of the defence encompass the right to be informed of the charges, the right to legal representation, and the right to present evidence. Upholding these rights is essential to maintain the integrity of the justice system and to protect individuals from arbitrary actions by authorities.",
