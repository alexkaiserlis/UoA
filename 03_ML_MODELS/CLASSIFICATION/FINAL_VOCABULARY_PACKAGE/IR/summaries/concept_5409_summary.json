  "summary": "A \"mixed agreement\" in EU legal terminology refers to treaties that involve both the European Union and its Member States, particularly in areas where competencies are shared or where external relations are concerned. These agreements are distinguished by their complexity, as they require formalities from both the EU and its contracting states, such as Norway, Iceland, and Switzerland. The ruling of a tribunal may involve the interpretation of such agreements, which often include appendices and stipulations regarding transit and charges. Consequently, mixed agreements empower the EU to simplify procedures and enhance cooperation, thereby facilitating the exchange of goods and services across borders while adhering to the established statutes.",
