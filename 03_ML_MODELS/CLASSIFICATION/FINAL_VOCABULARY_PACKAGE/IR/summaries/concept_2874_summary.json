  "summary": "In the context of the European Union's legislative framework, a \"written question\" serves as a formal mechanism through which Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) can seek clarification or information from the European Commission or the Council. This procedural tool is essential for ensuring transparency and accountability within EU governance. Written questions allow MEPs to address specific issues, request data, or highlight concerns regarding legislative matters or regulatory practices. The responses to these inquiries contribute to the parliamentary oversight function, facilitating informed debate and decision-making within the EU's complex legal landscape.",
