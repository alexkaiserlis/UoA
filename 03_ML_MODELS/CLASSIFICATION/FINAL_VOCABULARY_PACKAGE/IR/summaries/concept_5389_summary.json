  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"shareholder\" refers to an individual or entity that holds shares in a company, thereby possessing ownership rights and responsibilities. Shareholders play a critical role in corporate governance, influencing decisions through voting rights at general meetings. EU regulations, such as the Shareholder Rights Directive, aim to enhance transparency and protect shareholder interests, promoting active engagement in corporate affairs. This concept is pivotal in ensuring accountability and fostering a conducive environment for investment within the EU's single market, thereby contributing to the overall stability and growth of business organisations.",
