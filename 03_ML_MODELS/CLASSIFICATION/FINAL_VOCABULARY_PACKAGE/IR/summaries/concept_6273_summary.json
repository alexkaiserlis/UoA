  "summary": "\"Special leave\" refers to a specific type of absence from work that is granted under particular circumstances, distinct from regular vacation or sick leave. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, it encompasses provisions that allow employees to take time off for reasons such as family emergencies, personal matters, or other significant life events. The organization of work and working conditions within the EU aims to ensure that such leave is recognized and regulated to protect workers' rights. This concept is crucial for fostering a balanced work-life dynamic and promoting employee well-being across member states.",
