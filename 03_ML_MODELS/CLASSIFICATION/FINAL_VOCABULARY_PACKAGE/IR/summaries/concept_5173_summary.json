It encompasses the valuation of land, which significantly influences urban development, zoning regulations, and public infrastructure projects. The price of land is affected by various factors, including market demand, location, and planning permissions. EU directives often address land pricing to ensure equitable access and sustainable development, promoting fair competition among developers.
