  "summary": "Cultural geography, as a concept within the realm of natural and applied sciences, pertains to the study of how cultural practices and phenomena are spatially distributed and interact with the physical environment. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, understanding cultural geography is essential for formulating policies that address regional development, heritage conservation, and social cohesion. The EU recognizes the importance of cultural geography in promoting cultural diversity and sustainable development, which are integral to its legislative initiatives. By integrating cultural geography into regulatory assessments, the EU aims to enhance the effectiveness of its policies in fostering a cohesive European identity while respecting local cultural contexts.",
