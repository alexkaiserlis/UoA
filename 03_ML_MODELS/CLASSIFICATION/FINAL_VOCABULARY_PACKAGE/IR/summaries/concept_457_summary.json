  "summary": "Political discrimination refers to the unjust treatment of individuals based on their political beliefs or affiliations, impacting their rights and freedoms within the EU framework. This concept is pivotal in ensuring that all citizens can participate in democratic processes without fear of reprisal or exclusion. EU legal instruments, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights, emphasize the importance of non-discrimination, including political discrimination, as a fundamental principle. Addressing political discrimination is essential for upholding democratic values and fostering an inclusive society, where diverse political opinions can coexist without hindrance, thereby reinforcing the integrity of the EUâ€™s democratic institutions.",
