  "summary": "Family reunification is a critical concept within EU migration law, facilitating the right of non-EU nationals to reunite with family members residing in EU member states. This legal framework aims to uphold family unity, allowing spouses, children, and other dependents to join their relatives who have legal residency status. The EU's directives, such as the Family Reunification Directive (2003/86/EC), establish minimum standards for member states, ensuring that applications are processed fairly and efficiently. This regulatory approach balances the need for migration control with humanitarian considerations, reflecting the EU's commitment to protecting family life amidst diverse migration flows.",
