  "summary": "The concept of \"assisting spouse\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to the recognition of the role of a spouse who supports the primary income earner in the labour market. This term often intersects with discussions on employment rights, social security benefits, and family law, particularly in contexts where spousal contributions to household income are considered. The EU emphasizes the importance of equitable treatment in the labour market, which includes acknowledging the economic value of non-remunerated work performed by assisting spouses. This recognition is crucial for ensuring comprehensive social protection and promoting gender equality in employment policies across member states.",
