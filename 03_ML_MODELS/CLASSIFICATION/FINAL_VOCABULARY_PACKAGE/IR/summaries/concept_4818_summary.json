  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the term \"tariff\" is often redirected to \"price list,\" which serves as a foundational document outlining pricing structures for various goods and services. This price list can include differentials based on factors such as tonnages, shipping channels, and the combustibility of products like fuels and tobacco. It presupposes advantageous alignments for buyers and sellers, facilitating consultative processes. Regulatory frameworks may impose surcharges or rebates to ensure compliance, while competitors must navigate these pricing structures without infringing on established norms. The accurate quotation of prices is crucial, as alterations can significantly impact market dynamics and consumer loyalty.",
