  "summary": "A \"federal State\" refers to a political framework characterized by the division of powers between a central authority and constituent political units, such as states or regions. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, the concept is pivotal for understanding the distribution of competencies and the principle of subsidiarity. Federal States often have a constitution that delineates the powers of the federal government and the rights of the states, ensuring a balance that promotes both unity and diversity. The EU itself exhibits federal characteristics, as it operates through a complex interplay of supranational and intergovernmental governance, influencing member states' legislative processes.",
