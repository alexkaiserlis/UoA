  "summary": "The \"opinion of the Court of Justice (EU)\" refers to the authoritative interpretations provided by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on matters of EU law. These opinions are crucial for ensuring uniform application and understanding of EU regulations across member states. They can address questions posed by national courts or institutions, thereby clarifying legal ambiguities and guiding the implementation of EU directives. As a redirect, this term emphasizes the preferred nomenclature for referencing the Court's advisory role, which significantly influences the development of EU jurisprudence and the harmonization of legal standards within the Union.",
