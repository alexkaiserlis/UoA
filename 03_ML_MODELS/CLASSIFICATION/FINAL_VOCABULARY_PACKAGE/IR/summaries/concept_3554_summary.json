  "summary": "The concept of \"additional resources\" within the context of the EU budget refers to supplementary financial allocations that may be required to address unforeseen expenditures or enhance existing programs. These resources are crucial for ensuring that the EU's financial framework remains flexible and responsive to emerging needs, such as crisis management or new policy initiatives. The legal basis for accessing additional resources is typically outlined in the EU's budgetary regulations, which provide mechanisms for their approval and allocation. Such provisions ensure that the EU can effectively mobilize funds to support its strategic objectives and maintain fiscal stability across member states.",
