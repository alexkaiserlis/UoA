  "summary": "The concept of \"public open data,\" redirected to the preferred term \"open data,\" refers to data that is made available to the public without restrictions on use or redistribution. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, open data is pivotal for enhancing transparency, fostering innovation, and promoting citizen engagement. The European Union's initiatives, such as the Open Data Directive, aim to facilitate access to public sector information, thereby encouraging the reuse of data across various sectors. This regulatory approach underscores the importance of data accessibility in driving economic growth and improving public services within the EU.",
