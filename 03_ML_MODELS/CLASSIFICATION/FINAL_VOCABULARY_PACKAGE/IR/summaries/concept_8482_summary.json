  "summary": "The concept of \"European Union military operation,\" redirected to the preferred term \"EU military mission,\" encompasses the deployment of disciplined forces under EU auspices, often in collaboration with international bodies like the UNSG. Such missions, including MINUSCA and Sangaris, are designed to stabilize regions, exemplified by operations in Bangui and Kampala. Commanders, such as those referenced by Bradshaw and Guibert, oversee these deployable units, ensuring effective engagement with local clans and adherence to the regulatory frameworks established by the EU. The legal basis for these operations is rooted in the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), facilitating coordinated efforts among member states.",
