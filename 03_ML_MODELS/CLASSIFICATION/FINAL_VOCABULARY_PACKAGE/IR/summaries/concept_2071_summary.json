  "summary": "The concept of \"non-alignment\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to a strategic stance where a state or entity refrains from aligning itself with any major power blocs or military alliances. This principle is significant in international security discussions, as it allows for a neutral position in geopolitical conflicts, fostering diplomatic relations without the constraints of formal alliances. In EU policy, non-alignment can influence collective security strategies and the Union's approach to external relations, enabling member states to pursue independent foreign policies while contributing to regional stability and cooperation.",
