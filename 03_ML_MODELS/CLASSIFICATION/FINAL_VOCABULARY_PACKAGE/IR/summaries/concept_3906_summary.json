  "summary": "The \"right to move freely,\" often referred to as \"freedom of movement,\" is a fundamental principle enshrined in EU law, emphasizing the necessity for citizens to travel, reside, and work across member states without undue harassment or intimidation. This right encompasses various aspects, including the relaxation of visa requirements and the protection of travellers against violence and repression. The EU aims to liberalize movement, ensuring that inhabitants can engage peacefully in democratic processes. However, violations of this right can lead to brutal repercussions, necessitating intervention from authorities, including police and regulatory bureaux. The concept presupposes a commitment to uphold democracy and protect victims of any escalation of repression.",
