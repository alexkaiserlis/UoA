  "summary": "A \"special-status institution\" refers to a category of financial institutions within the European Union that possess unique regulatory privileges or obligations distinct from standard financial entities. These institutions may include development banks or entities engaged in specific public policy objectives, thus necessitating tailored oversight frameworks. The designation of special status often arises from their role in fostering economic stability, promoting social cohesion, or addressing market failures. Consequently, they are subject to specific legal provisions that govern their operations, ensuring compliance with EU financial regulations while enabling them to fulfill their specialized mandates effectively.",
