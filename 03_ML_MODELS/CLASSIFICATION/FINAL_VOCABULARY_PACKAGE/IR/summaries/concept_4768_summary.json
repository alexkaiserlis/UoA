  "summary": "The concept of \"package travel\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the comprehensive arrangements made for travel services, combining at least two components such as transport, accommodation, or other tourist services. Governed by the Package Travel Directive (2015/2302/EU), this legal instrument aims to enhance consumer protection, ensuring transparency and fairness in contractual obligations. It mandates clear information disclosure, rights to cancellation, and liability for service providers, thereby safeguarding travelers against potential risks. The regulation reflects the EU's commitment to fostering a secure and equitable travel environment, promoting consumer confidence in package travel arrangements across member states.",
