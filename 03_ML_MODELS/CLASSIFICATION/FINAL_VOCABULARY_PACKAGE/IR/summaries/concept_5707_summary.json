  "summary": "The \"liberalisation of the market\" refers to the operationally significant process within EU trade policy aimed at reducing barriers to trade and enhancing competition among providers across various sectors, including telecommunications and agriculture. This concept, as amended through various directives and regulations, facilitates the procurement of lproducts and services by promoting reciprocity and ownership rights. It encompasses the privatisation of state-owned enterprises and the consolidation of markets, reflecting a shift from socialist frameworks. The liberalisation process also addresses specific sectors, such as floricultural products and postal services, ensuring that regulations do not become redundant. In this context, the relationship to the preferred term underscores the EU's commitment to an integrated market, fostering economic growth and cooperation among member states, including those in the enlarged Baltic region and partnerships with countries like Morocco and Vietnam.",
