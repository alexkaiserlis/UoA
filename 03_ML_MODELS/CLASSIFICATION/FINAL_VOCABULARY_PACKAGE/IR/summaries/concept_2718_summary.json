The legal framework aims to ensure the inocuidad of these products, addressing potential hazards like Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio vulnificus. Normas and regulaciones dictate the harvesting and processing methods, emphasizing sustainability and protection of marine ecosystems. Additionally, the concept includes biannual assessments of fish stocks, ensuring that accumulations of species like Mytilus edulis and Homarus americanus are managed effectively. The EU's commitment to rural development (rurales) and environmental protection (protección) is reflected in these regulations, which also consider the viewpoints of stakeholders in the fisheries sector.",
