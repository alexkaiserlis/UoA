  "summary": "The \"conciliation procedure,\" often referred to simply as \"conciliation,\" is a vital mechanism within EU finance aimed at resolving disputes among member states or institutions. This procedure facilitates dialogue, urging parties to organize their positions and reach a harmonious judgment without resorting to litigation. It is particularly relevant in contexts involving demographic challenges, such as migration and the integration of foreigners into society. The procedure encompasses propositions that address the needs of various populations, including labour and education sectors. By reaffirming commitments to cooperation, the conciliation procedure extends the frontiers of intergovernmental relations, ensuring that cultural and societal factors are harmonized while safeguarding the rights of nationals and migrants alike.",
