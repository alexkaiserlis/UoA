  "summary": "The term \"middle class\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework refers to a socio-economic group characterized by moderate income levels, which plays a crucial role in the stability and growth of the European economy. The middle class is often associated with access to education, healthcare, and social services, contributing to social cohesion and economic resilience. EU policies aim to support the middle class through various initiatives, including employment regulations, social protection measures, and economic development programs. Understanding the dynamics of the middle class is essential for formulating effective legislation that addresses inequality and promotes sustainable development across member states.",
