  "summary": "The concept of \"pregnant woman\" is categorized under family law within EU legal frameworks and is redirected to the preferred term \"motherhood.\" This reflects the broader legal recognition of the rights and responsibilities associated with motherhood, particularly in the context of maternity leave, health care, and family benefits. EU regulations emphasize the protection of pregnant women, ensuring their well-being during pregnancy and after childbirth. The focus on motherhood encompasses various aspects, including social security rights and workplace protections, thereby promoting gender equality and safeguarding the health of both mothers and their children within the EU legal landscape.",
