  "summary": "The concept of a \"shorter working week\" pertains to the organization of work and working conditions within the European Union. This regulatory framework aims to enhance work-life balance, improve employee well-being, and increase productivity. By advocating for reduced working hours, the EU seeks to address issues related to labor rights and social equity. The implementation of a shorter working week may involve legislative measures that encourage member states to adopt flexible working arrangements, thereby fostering a more sustainable labor market. This concept aligns with broader EU objectives of promoting fair working conditions and ensuring the protection of workers' rights across diverse sectors.",
