  "summary": "Radicalisation refers to the process through which individuals or groups adopt extreme political, social, or religious ideologies, often leading to violent extremism. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, radicalisation poses significant challenges to social cohesion and security. The EU has implemented various strategies to counter radicalisation, focusing on prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation. These initiatives aim to address the underlying factors contributing to radicalisation, such as social exclusion and ideological indoctrination. Legal instruments and policies, including the EU Action Plan on Preventing Radicalisation, emphasize cooperation among member states to enhance resilience against radical ideologies and promote social integration.",
