  "summary": "\"Sectoral aid\" refers to financial support provided by EU member states to specific sectors, often to counteract economic challenges or to promote modernization. This aid can be crucial for industries facing underfished resources or those recovering from disasters, such as a tsunami that has wrecked local economies. The legal framework surrounding sectoral aid aims to ensure that such support does not materially distort competition, safeguarding the interests of all stakeholders. Respondents to inquiries about this aid must disclose relevant information, while the EU enforces regulations to prevent inaccuracies in reporting. Ultimately, sectoral aid seeks to rebuild and equip sectors, ensuring they remain seaworthy in a competitive market.",
