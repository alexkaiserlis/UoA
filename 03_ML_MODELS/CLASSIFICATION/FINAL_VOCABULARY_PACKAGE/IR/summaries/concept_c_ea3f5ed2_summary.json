  "summary": "The term \"lighter-than-air aircraft,\" commonly referred to as \"aerostat,\" encompasses various types of airships and balloons that operate using buoyancy principles. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, aerostats are subject to specific aviation regulations aimed at ensuring safety, environmental compliance, and airspace management. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) oversees the certification and operational standards for these aircraft, emphasizing their unique operational characteristics compared to heavier-than-air vehicles. Understanding the regulatory landscape surrounding aerostats is crucial for stakeholders in air and space transport, as it impacts innovation and compliance within the sector.",
