  "summary": "The concept of \"infertility\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks is primarily redirected to the preferred term \"fertility.\" This relationship underscores the importance of fertility in demographic studies and population policies, which are critical for addressing challenges related to reproductive health and family planning. The EU recognizes that understanding fertility rates is essential for formulating effective social policies, particularly in the context of aging populations and declining birth rates. Regulations and directives may address issues surrounding reproductive rights, access to fertility treatments, and the socio-economic implications of infertility, thereby influencing demographic trends and population sustainability across member states.",
