  "summary": "Juvenile delinquency refers to the participation of minors in illegal activities, which poses significant challenges for social affairs and legal frameworks within the EU. The regulatory approach to juvenile delinquency emphasizes rehabilitation over punishment, aiming to reintegrate young offenders into society. EU member states are encouraged to adopt measures that address the root causes of delinquent behavior, including socio-economic factors and educational deficits. The EU promotes cooperation among member states to share best practices and develop comprehensive strategies that prioritize the welfare of juveniles while ensuring public safety. Effective intervention programs are essential for reducing recidivism and fostering positive youth development.",
