  "summary": "Flevoland, a region in the Netherlands, is categorized under the EU's Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) and plays a significant role in various EU funding frameworks, including the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). The region's development priorities reflect the challenges of globalisation, redundancies in the labour market, and the need for reintegration of workers. Programming in Flevoland is governed by interinstitutional agreements that mobilise resources for rural development and aquaculture. The allocation of funds is indexed to inflation and reflects the broader patterns of economic activity, ensuring compatibility with EU objectives for sustainable growth and additionality in contributions from partners.",
