  "summary": "The concept of \"classification of animal species,\" redirected to \"animal taxonomy,\" is pivotal within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly in biodiversity conservation and environmental protection. Animal taxonomy involves the systematic categorization of species, which is essential for implementing regulations such as the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive. Accurate classification underpins effective monitoring and management of wildlife, ensuring compliance with EU legislation aimed at preserving ecosystems. Furthermore, taxonomy informs risk assessments related to invasive species and supports the EU's commitment to sustainable development and the protection of natural habitats, thereby enhancing ecological integrity across member states.",
