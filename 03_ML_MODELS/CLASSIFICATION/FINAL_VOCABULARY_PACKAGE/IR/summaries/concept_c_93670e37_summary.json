  "summary": "A \"karst area\" refers to a unique geological landscape characterized by soluble rock formations, primarily limestone, which undergo significant erosion, leading to distinctive features such as sinkholes, caves, and underground rivers. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, karst areas are often subject to specific environmental protections due to their ecological significance and biodiversity. The European Union emphasizes the conservation of such natural environments under various directives, including the Habitats Directive, which aims to protect habitats and species within these regions. Effective management and sustainable practices are crucial to preserving the integrity of karst ecosystems.",
