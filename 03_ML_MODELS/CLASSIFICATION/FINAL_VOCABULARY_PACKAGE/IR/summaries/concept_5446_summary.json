  "summary": "The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is an intergovernmental organization aimed at promoting regional integration and cooperation among South Asian nations. Established in 1985, SAARC facilitates collaboration in various sectors, including economic growth, social development, and cultural exchange. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, SAARC's initiatives may intersect with EU foreign policy objectives, particularly regarding trade agreements and regional stability. The EU often engages with extra-European organisations like SAARC to foster diplomatic relations and enhance mutual understanding, thereby contributing to broader geopolitical strategies in South Asia.",
