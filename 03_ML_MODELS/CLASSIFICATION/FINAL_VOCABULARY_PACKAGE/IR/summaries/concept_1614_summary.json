  "summary": "Neo-liberalism, as a political framework within EU legal and regulatory contexts, emphasizes the principles of liberalism, advocating for minimal state intervention in economic affairs and promoting free markets. This concept underpins various EU policies aimed at enhancing competition, deregulating industries, and fostering economic growth. Although \"neo-liberalism\" is a redirect to \"liberalism,\" it specifically addresses the contemporary adaptations of liberal thought, particularly in the context of globalization and market-oriented reforms. The EU's regulatory framework often reflects these neo-liberal tenets, aiming to balance economic efficiency with social welfare, thereby influencing legislative measures across member states.",
