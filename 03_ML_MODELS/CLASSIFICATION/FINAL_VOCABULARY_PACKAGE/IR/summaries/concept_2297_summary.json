  "summary": "The concept of \"rich nation,\" a redirect to \"industrialised country,\" pertains to nations characterized by advanced economic conditions and diversified industries. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, industrialised countries, such as those in Australasia and the transatlantic region, are often evaluated for their eligibility in trade agreements and partnerships. These nations, benefitting from rationalisation and enhancement of their economic structures, frequently engage with developing countries like Ghana and Nicaragua under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP). The EU's regulatory measures aim to bridge economic disparities, intensifying cooperation with partners in regions like CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Colombia, while assessing the usefulness of such engagements for mutual growth.",
