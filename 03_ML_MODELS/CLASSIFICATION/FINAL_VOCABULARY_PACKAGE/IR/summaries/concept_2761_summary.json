  "summary": "Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a critical measure within national accounts, translating economic activity into quantifiable metrics that inform EU regulatory frameworks. The Council-adopted Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) hinges on GDP figures to assess member states' fiscal health, targeting sustainable economic growth. However, slippages in GDP can lead to stagnation or even deterioration, jeopardising compliance with EU commitments. Recent trends show a rebounding momentum, with some nations overachieving their targets, while others face protracted challenges. The looming threat of economic hikes or deceleration necessitates vigilant monitoring, as these fluctuations can impact residences and financial stability across the Eurozone.",
