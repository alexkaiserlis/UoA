It addresses various health concerns, such as apnoea, diabetes, and epilepsy, which can affect drivers' fitness to operate vehicles, including motorcycles and mopeds. The regulatory framework is designed to accommodate diverse driving abilities and promote environmentally friendly practices, particularly with the rise of electric and hybrid vehicles. By establishing standardized entitlements and skills for drivers, the EU seeks to avert accidents and enhance road safety. This comprehensive approach illustrates the EU's commitment to fighting polluting practices and ensuring that all drivers can navigate tunnels and roads safely.",
