  "summary": "The concept of \"gulf\" within the context of international law refers to a significant maritime area that can influence various legal frameworks, including territorial waters and exclusive economic zones (EEZs). In EU regulatory documents, the delineation of gulfs is crucial for establishing jurisdictional boundaries, resource management, and environmental protection. The legal status of gulfs can affect fishing rights, shipping routes, and the implementation of maritime law. Understanding the implications of gulfs is essential for EU member states in negotiating treaties and ensuring compliance with international maritime regulations, thereby fostering cooperation and sustainable development in shared marine environments.",
