  "summary": "The concept of \"reference to the EC Court of Justice for an interpretation\" pertains to the preliminary ruling procedure, a crucial mechanism within EU law. This procedure allows national courts to seek clarification on the interpretation of EU law from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). By facilitating uniform application of EU legislation, the preliminary ruling procedure ensures that legal certainty and coherence are maintained across member states. This process not only enhances judicial cooperation but also strengthens the rule of law within the EU framework, allowing for the resolution of legal ambiguities that may arise in national jurisdictions.",
