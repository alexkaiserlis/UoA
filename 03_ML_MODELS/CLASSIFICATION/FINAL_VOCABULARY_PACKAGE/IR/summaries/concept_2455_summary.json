  "summary": "The \"common fisheries policy\" (CFP) is a pivotal EU regulatory framework aimed at ensuring the sustainable management of fishery resources across member states. It seeks to address overexploitation by reorientating fishing practices and establishing uniformity in regulations. The CFP encompasses a breadth of measures, including the use of logbooks to monitor onboard activities and the prohibition of certain fishing gear like gillnets and dredgers. It also promotes multispecies management, ensuring the protection of vulnerable species such as sardinella and dolphin. The Commission devises pluriannual plans to enhance resource sustainability, while denouncing duplications in regulatory efforts. Through this policy, the EU aims to outperform global standards in fisheries management, thereby securing the eligibility of its fishing vessels within international frameworks, such as the GFCM and ITC.",
