  "summary": "The concept of \"legal professional,\" a redirect to the preferred term \"legal profession,\" encompasses the organization of judiciaries within the EU legal framework. It includes practitioners such as advocates and judges, who play a critical role in fostering judicial integrity and ensuring citizens' rights. The legal profession is governed by cumulative qualifications and emoluments that empower legal representatives to appeal cases effectively. Interinstitutional meetings, such as those held in Tampere and Amsterdam, aim to lower barriers and enhance understanding among member states. This gradual renewal of legal standards promotes genuine exchanges and incentives to fight crime, thereby reinforcing the rule of law across economies.",
