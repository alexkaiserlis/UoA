  "summary": "Cybernetics, a field within natural and applied sciences, encompasses the study of regulatory systems, feedback mechanisms, and communication processes in both biological and artificial systems. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, cybernetics plays a crucial role in the development of policies related to data protection, artificial intelligence, and automated decision-making. The EU's emphasis on ethical guidelines and regulatory compliance in technology deployment necessitates an understanding of cybernetic principles to ensure that systems operate transparently and accountably. This interdisciplinary approach aids in addressing complex challenges posed by digital transformation and fosters innovation while safeguarding fundamental rights.",
