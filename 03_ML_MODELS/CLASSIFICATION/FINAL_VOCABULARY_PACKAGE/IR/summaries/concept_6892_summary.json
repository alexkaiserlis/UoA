  "summary": "The concept of \"linguistic quality of a law,\" redirected to \"legislative drafting,\" emphasizes the importance of precise language in EU legal and regulatory documents. Proper legislative drafting ensures that laws are devoid of errors and broken provisions, which can lead to significant issues in implementation. Committees play a crucial role in correcting drafts at various stages, checking for linguistic accuracy in all official languages, including Finnish, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Italian, and others. This process involves detailed management of amendments and provisions to ensure that the final versions correspond to the intended legal framework, benefiting all persons and organisations involved. Effective drafting also controls the distribution of legal texts, ensuring relevant dates and applicable tariffs are clearly defined, thereby enhancing the overall administration of EU law.",
