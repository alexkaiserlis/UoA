  "summary": "Arbitration is a pivotal mechanism within the EU legal framework, facilitating the resolution of disputes outside traditional court systems. It embodies principles of autonomy and efficiency, allowing parties to select arbitrators and tailor procedures to their needs. This alternative dispute resolution method is particularly relevant in cross-border commercial contexts, where it mitigates jurisdictional complexities. The EU promotes arbitration through various directives and regulations, enhancing its enforceability and ensuring compliance with international standards, such as the New York Convention. By fostering a robust arbitration culture, the EU aims to bolster legal certainty and economic cooperation among member states.",
