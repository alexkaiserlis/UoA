  "summary": "Recycling technology encompasses advanced methods and processes aimed at the utilization of waste materials, transforming them into raw materials for further use. Within the EU regulatory framework, this concept is integral to various programmes and subprogrammes that authorize cooperation among member states, including Sweden and the United Kingdom. The European Parliament has adopted proposals concerning recycling technology, which include agreements that cover scientific research and technical actions. These initiatives are designed to negotiate cost-effective solutions and provide a comprehensive approach to recycling, thereby enhancing the economic efficiency of the communities involved and ensuring sustainable development in the field.",
