  "summary": "The \"Republic of Albania,\" redirected to the preferred term \"Albania,\" is a significant entity in EU political geography, particularly concerning its integration and regulatory alignment with EU frameworks. Albania's journey involves pledges for demilitarisation and adherence to conditionality principles, which are crucial for EU accession. The country has engaged in various programmes, such as the PRGF, to address economic challenges and rescheduling of undisbursed funds. The aftermath of its communist past necessitates careful planning, emphasising the need for concessionality in financial support. Additionally, Albania's strategic position as a haven for regional stability is underscored by its cooperation with EU missions like EUMC, while addressing issues such as the management of small arms and light weapons (SALW). The regulatory landscape is further complicated by imprecision in historical narratives and the need for effective governance structures, particularly in areas like Korçë and Gramsh, where incubating local initiatives can foster development.",
