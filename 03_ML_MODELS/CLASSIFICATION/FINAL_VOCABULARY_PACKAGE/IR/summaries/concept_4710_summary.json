  "summary": "The concept of \"medium-sized town\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to urban planning and construction regulations. These towns typically serve as critical nodes in regional development, balancing residential, commercial, and public spaces. The EU encourages sustainable urban development through various directives, promoting efficient land use and infrastructure investment in medium-sized towns. Such towns often benefit from EU funding programs aimed at enhancing local governance and improving living conditions. The classification of a medium-sized town is essential for implementing specific policies related to urbanization, environmental protection, and social cohesion, ensuring compliance with broader EU objectives in construction and town planning.",
