  "summary": "The concept of \"space station\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the governance of research and intellectual property related to extraterrestrial environments. Space stations serve as pivotal platforms for scientific inquiry, enabling collaborative research initiatives among EU member states and international partners. The regulatory landscape encompasses various aspects, including the protection of intellectual property generated in these unique environments, compliance with international treaties, and the establishment of protocols for the utilization of space resources. As the EU advances its space exploration agenda, the legal implications surrounding space stations will increasingly influence research funding, innovation, and international cooperation.",
