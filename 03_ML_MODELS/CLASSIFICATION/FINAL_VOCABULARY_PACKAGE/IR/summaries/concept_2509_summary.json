  "summary": "The EU's \"migration policy\" encompasses a framework designed to manage the influx of foreigners while ensuring the protection of displaced populations. It aims to organize and facilitate the reuniting of families, allowing for the integration of migrants into society and the workforce. The policy is dictated by intergovernmental agreements and communiqués that urge cooperation among member states. It also addresses demographic challenges by reaffirming the importance of education and cultural orientation for newcomers. Visa regulations and residence permits are critical components, as they authorize nationals to traverse frontiers while maintaining security and societal stability. The EU continually evaluates and extends its propositions to adapt to evolving migration dynamics.",
