  "summary": "The concept of \"slaughtered poultry\" pertains to the agricultural activity of processing birds for human consumption within the European Union. This term is significant in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly those governing food safety, animal welfare, and agricultural standards. Regulations such as the EU Hygiene Package and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) establish stringent guidelines for the treatment of poultry prior to and during slaughter. Compliance with these regulations is essential to ensure the quality and safety of poultry products, thereby protecting consumer health and promoting fair trade practices across member states.",
