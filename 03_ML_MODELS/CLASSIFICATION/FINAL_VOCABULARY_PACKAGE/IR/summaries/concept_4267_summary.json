  "summary": "Official statistics are essential tools in the European Union's regulatory framework, providing reliable data that underpin economic analysis and policy-making. These statistics are systematically collected, processed, and disseminated by national statistical institutes and Eurostat, ensuring adherence to rigorous standards of accuracy and impartiality. The legal basis for official statistics is established by Regulation (EC) No 223/2009, which mandates the production and dissemination of statistical information to support the formulation of EU policies. This framework promotes transparency and accountability, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on empirical evidence derived from comprehensive statistical data.",
