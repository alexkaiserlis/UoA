  "summary": "The concept of \"transfer of population\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework refers to the movement of individuals across borders, often in the context of migration policies. This term encompasses various scenarios, including forced displacement due to conflict, economic migration, and resettlement initiatives. The EU's approach to the transfer of population is guided by principles of human rights, international law, and regional agreements, ensuring that such movements are conducted with respect for the dignity and safety of individuals. Regulatory measures aim to facilitate orderly migration while addressing the challenges posed by demographic shifts and integration processes within member states.",
