  "summary": "The concept of \"succession of states\" pertains to the legal framework governing the transfer of rights and obligations when a state ceases to exist or undergoes significant changes, such as secession or unification. In the context of EU law, this principle is crucial for determining the continuity of treaties, membership rights, and obligations of states that emerge from such transformations. The EU must navigate complex legal scenarios to ensure that the rights of citizens and entities are preserved, while also addressing issues of recognition and legitimacy in international relations. Understanding succession of states is vital for maintaining stability within the EU's legal order.",
