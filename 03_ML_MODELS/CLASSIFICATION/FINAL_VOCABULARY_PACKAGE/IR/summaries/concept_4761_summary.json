  "summary": "A \"proxy vote\" is a mechanism within electoral procedures that allows an individual to authorize another person to vote on their behalf. This practice is particularly relevant in the context of the European Union's regulatory framework, where it ensures broader participation in decision-making processes, especially in legislative bodies. Proxy voting is governed by specific rules that aim to uphold the integrity of the voting process while accommodating the needs of voters who may be unable to attend. This concept is essential for promoting democratic engagement and ensuring that all voices are represented in EU governance.",
