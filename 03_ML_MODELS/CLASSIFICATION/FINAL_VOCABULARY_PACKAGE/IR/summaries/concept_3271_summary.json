  "summary": "The concept of \"replacement of imports,\" also known as \"import substitution,\" is a pivotal aspect of EU trade policy aimed at enhancing domestic production capabilities. This strategy seeks to reduce dependency on foreign goods by promoting local industries, thereby fostering economic resilience and sustainability. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, import substitution is often linked to initiatives that encourage innovation, competitiveness, and investment in local markets. By redirecting focus from external suppliers to domestic producers, the EU aims to bolster its internal market, support job creation, and ensure compliance with environmental standards.",
