  "summary": "San Marino, a microstate surrounded by Italy, plays a unique role in the political geography of Europe, particularly in relation to EU legal frameworks. Historically, San Marino has engaged in negotiations with the EU, resulting in agreements that facilitate the issuance of euro-denominated banknotes and coins. The country has acceded to various treaties, becoming a signatory to agreements that address issues such as counterfeiting and the regulation of banking modalities. In furtherance of its economic ties, San Marino undertakes periodic renegotiations to align its policies with EU standards, ensuring consistency in financial practices. Its historical links with the Vatican and Monaco further enrich its regulatory landscape.",
