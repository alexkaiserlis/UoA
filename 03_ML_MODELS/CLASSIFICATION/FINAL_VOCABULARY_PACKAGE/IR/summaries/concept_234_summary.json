  "summary": "Joint ownership, in the context of EU civil law, refers to a legal arrangement where two or more parties hold rights to a single asset or property concurrently. This concept is significant in various regulatory frameworks, particularly in matters of property law and inheritance. Joint ownership can manifest in different forms, such as joint tenancy or tenancy in common, each with distinct implications for the management and transfer of ownership rights. The EU legal system recognizes the complexities involved in joint ownership, necessitating clear regulations to address issues such as liability, decision-making, and the division of benefits among co-owners.",
