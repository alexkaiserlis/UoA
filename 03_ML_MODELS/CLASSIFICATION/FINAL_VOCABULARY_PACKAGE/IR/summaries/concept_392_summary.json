  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"expenditure\" refers to the allocation and disbursement of funds earmarked for specific purposes, such as modernisation projects or biannual assessments. Soundly managed expenditures are crucial for the effective functioning of institutions like OLAF and ECOFIN, which oversee financial compliance and transparency. Expenditures can be reimbursed through various mechanisms, including centralised funding for projects like waterway improvements or agricultural initiatives involving potato cultivation. The classification of expenditures, such as those related to software updates or costly infrastructure, is vital for accurate financial reporting. Institutions must commit to comprehensive detailing of expenditures to ensure accountability and prevent infringements.",
