  "summary": "Negotiation skills are essential competencies in the context of employment within the European Union's legal and regulatory framework. These skills facilitate effective dialogue and consensus-building among stakeholders, including employers, employees, and regulatory bodies. Proficient negotiation skills contribute to the resolution of disputes, the formulation of collective agreements, and the enhancement of workplace relations. In EU legal contexts, these skills are particularly relevant during the negotiation of transnational labor agreements and in compliance with directives aimed at promoting fair employment practices. Thus, negotiation skills play a pivotal role in fostering cooperation and ensuring adherence to EU labor standards.",
