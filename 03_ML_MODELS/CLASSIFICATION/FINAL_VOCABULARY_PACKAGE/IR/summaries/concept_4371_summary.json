  "summary": "The \"international monetary system\" encompasses the ordination of monetary relations among states, facilitating economic stability and cooperation. Within the EU context, this system is essential for establishing appropriate policies and ensuring the operation of the euro as a common currency. The European Parliament and the Council often hold consultations to formulate recommendations on necessary adjustments to the system. Decisions made in this field are guided by treaties, such as those of the EEC, which outline the method for economic integration. The Commission plays a pivotal role in shaping opinions and strategies, ensuring that member states align with community objectives in this domain.",
