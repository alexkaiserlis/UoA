  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the term \"social report\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"social audit.\" A social audit is a systematic evaluation of an organizationâ€™s social performance, assessing compliance with labor law and labor relations standards. It encompasses the examination of workplace conditions, employee rights, and corporate social responsibility initiatives. By conducting social audits, entities can ensure adherence to EU directives aimed at promoting fair labor practices and enhancing transparency. This process is vital for fostering accountability and improving stakeholder trust within the labor market, aligning with the EU's commitment to uphold fundamental rights in employment.",
