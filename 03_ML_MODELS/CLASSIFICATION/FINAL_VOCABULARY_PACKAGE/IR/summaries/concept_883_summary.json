  "summary": "The concept of \"State\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework refers to a sovereign political entity recognized under international law, possessing defined territory, a permanent population, and a government capable of entering into relations with other states. In EU law, the term is pivotal, as it delineates the responsibilities and rights of member states, particularly in areas such as compliance with EU directives and regulations. The state acts as a primary actor in the implementation of EU policies, ensuring adherence to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, which govern the distribution of powers between the EU and its member states.",
