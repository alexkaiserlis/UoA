  "summary": "The concept of \"rural community\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the collective social and economic structures in less densely populated areas. It encompasses the planning and construction of infrastructure that supports sustainable development, ensuring that rural populations have access to essential services and amenities. EU regulations often aim to enhance the resilience of rural communities by promoting local governance, environmental stewardship, and integrated rural development strategies. This concept is crucial in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and regional development initiatives, which seek to balance urban-rural dynamics and foster equitable growth across diverse geographical areas.",
