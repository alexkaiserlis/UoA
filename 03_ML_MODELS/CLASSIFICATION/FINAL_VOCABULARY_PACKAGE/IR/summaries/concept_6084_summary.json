  "summary": "The European Works Council (EWC) is a regulatory framework established to enhance dialogue between employees and employers across EU member states, particularly in multinational companies. It aims to afford employees, regardless of nationality, a platform to engage in discussions about their working conditions and rights, thereby striving for decent jobs. The EWC prevails in promoting interlinked goals of social dialogue and employee representation, observing specificities in diverse professions. By informing employees about corporate decisions, it enhances their skills and participation, drawing attention to exclusions that may arise in remote or seafaring jobs. This regulatory agenda is designed to prevent regression in labor rights across the oceans of Europe, ensuring that all workers, including those on ships, enjoy equitable treatment and opportunities.",
