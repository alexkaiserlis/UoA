  "summary": "The \"presumption of innocence\" is a fundamental principle enshrined in EU law, particularly within the context of rights and freedoms. It mandates that any individual accused of a crime is considered innocent until proven guilty, thereby safeguarding against wrongful convictions and ensuring a fair trial. This principle is vital in upholding the rule of law and protecting individual liberties. The presumption of innocence is articulated in various EU legal instruments, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which reinforces the necessity of due process and equitable treatment in judicial proceedings. This concept is essential for maintaining public confidence in the justice system.",
