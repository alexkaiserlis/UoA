  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, \"salted product\" refers to foodstuffs that undergo curing processes, such as salting or brining, to enhance preservation and flavor. This category encompasses various seafood, including bacalhau (cod), herrings, and anchovies, which are often lightly cured to prevent oxidation and degeneration. The curing process employs complex methods, including the use of diphosphates and triphosphates, which facilitate the penetration of salt into the product. Traditional specialties, such as clipfish and morhua, are recognized under specific nomenclatures, ensuring compliance with EU standards. These products are integral to meals and culinary traditions across member states, highlighting their significance in the food industry.",
