  "summary": "The \"single monetary policy\" within the EU framework refers to the centralized monetary governance executed by the Eurosystem, which encompasses the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks (NCBs) of member states. This policy aims to ensure soundness and stability in the euro area by pooling resources and implementing measures such as outright monetary transactions and liquidity easing. Conditionality is often attached to disbursements, particularly in the context of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), which acts as a guarantor for member states facing refinancing challenges. The policy fosters synergies among counterparties and enhances marketable bond liquidity, while also addressing the ratios of collateral and accrued interests. Through this centralised approach, the ECB steers economic stability, ensuring that debtor obligations are met and that the financial system remains robust against uncovered risks.",
