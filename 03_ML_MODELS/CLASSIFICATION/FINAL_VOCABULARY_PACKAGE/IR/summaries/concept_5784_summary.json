  "summary": "The concept of \"staff not employed under the staff regulations,\" commonly referred to as \"contract staff,\" pertains to individuals engaged by EU entities through contractual agreements rather than traditional employment. This arrangement entails specific procurement processes and compliance with legal frameworks, including alignment with the General Staff Regulations and relevant directives. Contract staff may include contractors and agents who are appointed to fulfill various roles, respecting the expectations of the EU's operational units. Their employment conditions, including severance and resettlement allowances, must be handled in a manner that avoids discrimination and ensures harmonised practices across entities. This classification is crucial for maintaining consistency within the EU's executive power and public service.",
