  "summary": "Agronomy, a branch of natural and applied sciences, plays a crucial role in the European Union's regulatory framework concerning agricultural practices and sustainability. It encompasses the study of crop production, soil management, and the optimization of agricultural systems to enhance food security and environmental protection. EU legal documents often reference agronomy in the context of policies aimed at promoting sustainable farming techniques, ensuring compliance with environmental standards, and fostering innovation in agricultural research. By integrating agronomic principles, the EU seeks to balance agricultural productivity with ecological integrity, thereby supporting its commitment to sustainable development and the Green Deal objectives.",
