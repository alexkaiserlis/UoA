  "summary": "Forestry research within the EU framework encompasses the study of forest genetic resources, focusing on the propagation and provenance of tree species. This research is crucial for developing reproductive material that complies with directives aimed at sustainable forestry practices. The EU regulates the marketing of seeds and plants derived from specific forest regions, ensuring that they meet authorized standards. Adverse effects on biodiversity and agriculture are considered, with member states required to restrict or prohibit the use of non-compliant materials. By providing information on genetic equivalence, forestry research supports the sustainable management of forest resources, thereby granting the necessary tools for effective environmental governance.",
