  "summary": "Sectoral planning refers to the strategic framework established by the European Union to empower member states in the efficient management of economic resources across specific sectors. This planning ensures that necessary measures are taken to align with the broader objectives of the Union. In conjunction with treaties and agreements, sectoral planning involves the decision-making process of the Commission and the Council, which may amend existing regulations or establish new directives. Hereinafter, these measures are referred to in various annexes, ensuring mutual recognition and operational consistency. The conclusion of sectoral planning is critical for the effective functioning of the community and the retention of competitive power within the global market, as exemplified by frameworks similar to those in Canada.",
