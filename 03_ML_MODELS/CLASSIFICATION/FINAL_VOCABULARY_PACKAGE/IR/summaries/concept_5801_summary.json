  "summary": "An \"aircraft carrier\" is a pivotal naval vessel classified under the category of defence within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. These ships serve as floating airbases, enabling the deployment of military aircraft and enhancing operational capabilities in maritime security. The EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) recognizes the strategic importance of aircraft carriers in collective defence initiatives. Their role extends beyond mere military applications, influencing geopolitical stability and international relations. As the EU navigates complex security challenges, the integration of aircraft carriers into defence strategies underscores their significance in maintaining a robust and responsive military posture.",
