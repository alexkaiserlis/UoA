  "summary": "In EU legal terminology, \"the bench\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"judge,\" referring to individuals who perform judicial functions within a tribunal. Judges are pivotal in litigation, contemplating cases and ensuring that justice is served in accordance with statutes. The appointment of judges involves a rigorous process, conferring responsibilities that require intellectual and factual suitability. Discussions around their workload and remuneration are frequent, as they cope with the demands of their posts. The cessation of a judge's duties may arise from resignation or other circumstances, impacting the jurisdiction and functioning of the legal system.",
