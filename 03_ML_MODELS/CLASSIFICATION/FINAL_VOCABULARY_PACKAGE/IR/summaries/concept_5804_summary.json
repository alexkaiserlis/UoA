  "summary": "The \"first stage of EMU\" refers to the initial phase of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) established by the European Union. This stage, initiated in 1990, focused on the convergence of member states' economies and the preparation for the eventual adoption of a single currency, the euro. Legal frameworks were developed to ensure stability and coordination among national monetary policies. Regulatory measures aimed to harmonize economic policies, enhance cooperation, and promote fiscal discipline, laying the groundwork for deeper integration. The first stage was crucial in aligning member states' economic indicators, which facilitated the transition to subsequent stages of the EMU.",
