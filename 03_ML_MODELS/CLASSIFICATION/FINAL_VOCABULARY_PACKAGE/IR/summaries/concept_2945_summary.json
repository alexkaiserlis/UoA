  "summary": "The concept of \"heat recovery,\" categorized under energy policy, is redirected to the preferred term \"energy recovery\" in EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Energy recovery encompasses processes that convert waste heat into usable energy, thereby enhancing energy efficiency and contributing to sustainability goals. The EU promotes energy recovery through various directives and regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and optimizing resource use. By integrating heat recovery systems, member states can comply with EU energy efficiency targets, thus fostering a circular economy. This regulatory focus underscores the importance of innovative energy solutions in achieving the EU's climate objectives.",
