  "summary": "The concept of \"prohibition of a party\" pertains to the legal frameworks governing political parties within the European Union. This term serves as a redirect to the preferred term \"formation of a party,\" highlighting the regulatory context in which parties may be established or dissolved. In EU law, the prohibition of a party can arise from violations of democratic principles or fundamental rights, necessitating a careful balance between political freedom and legal accountability. Understanding this concept is crucial for ensuring compliance with EU regulations that safeguard the integrity of political structures while promoting democratic engagement across member states.",
