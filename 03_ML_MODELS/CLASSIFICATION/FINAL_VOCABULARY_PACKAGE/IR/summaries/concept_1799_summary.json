  "summary": "The \"foreign exchange market\" is a critical component of monetary economics within the EU, facilitating the multilateralization of currencies and ensuring liquidity through various transactions. It involves the convertibility of currencies, allowing for settlements that confer privileges and immunities to participating banks. The market is governed by statutes that regulate the irrevocable parities and responsibilities of central banks, which are tasked with administering interventions to stabilize currencies during periods of critical disturbances. As such, the foreign exchange market plays a pivotal role in managing deficits and ensuring the seamless flow of capital, thereby supporting economic stability and growth across member states.",
