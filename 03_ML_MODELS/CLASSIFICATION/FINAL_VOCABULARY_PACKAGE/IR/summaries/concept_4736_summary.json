  "summary": "The term \"international waterway\" refers to navigable bodies of water that are accessible for maritime and inland waterway transport across national boundaries. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, international waterways are crucial for facilitating trade and ensuring the free movement of goods and services. The EU promotes the development and maintenance of these waterways to enhance connectivity and sustainability within the internal market. Regulations governing international waterways often address safety standards, environmental protection, and navigation rights, ensuring compliance with both EU directives and international agreements. This concept is integral to the EU's transport policy and regional cooperation.",
