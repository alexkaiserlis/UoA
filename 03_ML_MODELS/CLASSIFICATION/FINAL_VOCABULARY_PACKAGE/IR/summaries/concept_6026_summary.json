  "summary": "The term \"supervisory board\" refers to a governance structure prevalent in various EU member states, particularly in the context of co-determination. Co-determination is a legal framework that mandates employee representation on supervisory boards, thereby fostering a collaborative approach to corporate governance. This mechanism enhances labor relations by ensuring that workers have a voice in strategic decision-making processes. In the EU, co-determination is instrumental in balancing the interests of shareholders and employees, promoting social dialogue and workplace democracy. As such, the concept of \"supervisory board\" redirects to \"co-determination,\" highlighting its role in labor law and regulatory frameworks across the Union.",
