  "summary": "The concept of \"work productivity\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework emphasizes the necessity for adaptability and lifelong learning among workers. It encourages the involvement of various partners, including taskforces, to strengthen governance and facilitate reforms aimed at enhancing job stability. The Lisbon Strategy highlights the importance of investing in young and older citizens, ensuring they are equipped to meet changing macro demands. By fostering an engaging environment, the EU aims to attract unemployed individuals to the labour market, emphasizing excellence and real opportunities. Funding from the European Social Fund (ESF) is recommended to support these priorities, ultimately pursuing a democratic orientation towards work productivity.",
