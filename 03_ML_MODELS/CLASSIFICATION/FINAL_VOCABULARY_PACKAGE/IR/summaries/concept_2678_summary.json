  "summary": "The concept of \"liberalisation of prices,\" also referred to as \"free price,\" pertains to the regulatory framework within the European Union aimed at promoting market competition by removing price controls. This process allows market forces to dictate pricing, fostering efficiency and consumer choice. In EU legal documents, the liberalisation of prices is often discussed in the context of various sectors, including energy and telecommunications, where regulatory bodies oversee the transition from regulated to free pricing structures. This shift is intended to enhance market dynamics, encourage investment, and ultimately benefit consumers through more competitive pricing.",
