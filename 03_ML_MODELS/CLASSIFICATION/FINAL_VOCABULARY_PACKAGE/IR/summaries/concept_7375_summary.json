  "summary": "The concept of \"party holding the balance of power,\" also known as a \"hinge party,\" is pivotal in EU political dynamics and regulatory frameworks. This term refers to a political entity that possesses a crucial position in legislative assemblies, often determining the outcome of votes and influencing policy directions. Hinge parties can emerge in coalition governments, where no single party holds an outright majority, thus playing a decisive role in negotiations and governance. Their influence extends to shaping legislative agendas and ensuring stability within the EU's multifaceted political landscape, making them integral to understanding the balance of power in EU decision-making processes.",
