  "summary": "The \"guarantee threshold\" in EU agricultural regulations refers to a specific level of support or assurance provided to farmers, particularly in the context of various schemes aimed at stabilizing production. This threshold acts as a norm, ensuring that producers can cultivate diverse varieties, such as moscatel and mavra, without impairing their financial viability. By establishing a steadier framework, the guarantee threshold mitigates risks associated with market fluctuations, such as overrunning production costs or delaying sales through auctioning. It also facilitates the redistribution of resources among producers, allowing for the ascertainment of fair prices for crops like cauliflower and tobaccos. Ultimately, this concept is crucial for maintaining the equilibrium in agricultural markets, ensuring that farmers can utilize their land effectively while foregoing excessive risks.",
