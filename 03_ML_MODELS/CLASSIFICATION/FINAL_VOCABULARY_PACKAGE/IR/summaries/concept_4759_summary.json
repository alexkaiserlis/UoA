  "summary": "\"Advance voting\" refers to the electoral procedure that allows voters to cast their ballots prior to the official election day. This practice is designed to enhance voter participation and accessibility, accommodating individuals who may be unable to vote on the designated date due to various reasons, such as personal commitments or health issues. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, advance voting is governed by specific national laws that align with EU directives on electoral integrity and democratic participation. The implementation of advance voting varies across member states, reflecting their individual electoral systems while adhering to overarching EU principles of transparency and fairness in the electoral process.",
