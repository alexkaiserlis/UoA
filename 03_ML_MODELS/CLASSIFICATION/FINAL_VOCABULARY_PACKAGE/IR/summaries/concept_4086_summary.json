  "summary": "The concept of \"subsistence level income\" refers to the minimum income necessary for individuals or families to maintain a basic standard of living, encompassing essential needs such as food, shelter, and clothing. Within the EU legal and regulatory framework, this concept is pivotal for assessing social welfare policies and poverty alleviation measures. It serves as a benchmark for determining eligibility for social assistance programs and informs the development of minimum income schemes across member states. By establishing a subsistence level income, the EU aims to promote social inclusion and ensure that all citizens can achieve a dignified standard of living.",
