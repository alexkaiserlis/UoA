This encompasses a range of regulatory provisions and directives that mandate accessibility, non-discrimination, and the provision of adequate support services. The EU promotes inclusive policies that facilitate the integration of people with disabilities into society, emphasizing their right to participate fully in social, economic, and cultural life. Legal instruments, such as the European Accessibility Act, underpin these commitments, ensuring that care services are tailored to meet diverse needs and uphold the principles of equality and respect.",
