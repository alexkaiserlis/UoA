  "summary": "The concept of \"one-parent family\" refers to a family structure where a single parent is responsible for the upbringing and care of one or more children. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is significant for policies addressing social welfare, family law, and anti-discrimination measures. The EU recognizes the unique challenges faced by one-parent families, such as economic vulnerability and social exclusion. Consequently, various directives and regulations aim to provide support mechanisms, including financial assistance and access to childcare services, to promote the well-being and rights of these families within the broader framework of family policy in the EU.",
