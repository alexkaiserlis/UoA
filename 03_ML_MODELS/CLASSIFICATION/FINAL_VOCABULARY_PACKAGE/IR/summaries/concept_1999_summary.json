  "summary": "The term \"separatist movement\" is often redirected to \"autonomous movement\" within EU legal and regulatory contexts. Autonomous movements seek to achieve greater self-governance or independence from a larger political entity, often invoking principles of self-determination and regional identity. In the EU, such movements can raise complex legal issues, including the balance between national sovereignty and regional autonomy. The EU's regulatory framework must navigate these dynamics, ensuring adherence to fundamental rights while addressing the political aspirations of autonomous movements. Understanding this relationship is crucial for policymakers and legal practitioners engaged in regional governance and public safety discussions.",
