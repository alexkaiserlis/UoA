  "summary": "The concept of \"exemption from restrictive-practice authorisation\" pertains to EU competition law, allowing certain practices that might typically be deemed anti-competitive to be exempted under specific justifications. This exemption is crucial for SMEs and consortia engaged in sectors like audiovisual media, shipping, and broadband, where dominant market players often predetermine market conditions. By deploying exemptions, the EU aims to foster competition while minimising adverse effects on culture and heritage. Such exemptions are particularly relevant in sparsely populated or outermost regions, where traditional market dynamics may not apply, and where modernisation efforts can be supported through tailored regulatory frameworks.",
