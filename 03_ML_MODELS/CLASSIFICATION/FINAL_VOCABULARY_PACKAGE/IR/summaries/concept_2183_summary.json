  "summary": "The \"Warsaw Treaty,\" commonly referred to as the \"Warsaw Pact Organisation,\" was a collective defense treaty established in 1955 among Eastern Bloc countries. It served as a counterbalance to NATO during the Cold War, promoting military cooperation and political alignment among its member states. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the Warsaw Pact Organisation is significant for understanding historical geopolitical dynamics that influenced the formation of contemporary European security policies. Although the Pact was dissolved in 1991, its legacy continues to inform discussions on regional security cooperation and the evolution of European organisations within the EU.",
