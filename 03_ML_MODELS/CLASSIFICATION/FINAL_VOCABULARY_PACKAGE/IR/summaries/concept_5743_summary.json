  "summary": "The term \"miner\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to individuals engaged in the extraction of minerals, particularly in sectors governed by specific labor market regulations. The EU recognizes the unique challenges faced by miners, including health and safety risks, working conditions, and labor rights. Regulatory measures, such as the Directive on the protection of workers from risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work, aim to safeguard miners' welfare. Additionally, the EU's labor market policies seek to ensure fair employment practices and promote sustainable development in mining regions, reflecting the sector's significance in the broader economic landscape.",
