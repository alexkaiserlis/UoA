  "summary": "The concept of \"infancy\" within EU civil law pertains to the legal status of individuals who are not yet of age, typically defined as those under 18 years. In this context, infancy signifies a period during which individuals are afforded specific protections and limitations concerning their legal capacity. This includes restrictions on entering contracts and the ability to engage in legal proceedings independently. The EU regulatory framework emphasizes the necessity of safeguarding minors' rights, ensuring that their interests are prioritized in legal matters. Consequently, infancy is a critical concept in the realm of civil law, influencing various legal instruments and policies aimed at protecting vulnerable populations.",
