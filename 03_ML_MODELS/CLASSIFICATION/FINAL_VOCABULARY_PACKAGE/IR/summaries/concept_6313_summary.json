  "summary": "The concept of \"agricultural area with environmental restrictions\" pertains to designated farming zones within the EU that are subject to specific environmental regulations aimed at promoting sustainable agricultural practices. These restrictions are integral to the EU's agricultural policy framework, ensuring that farming activities align with environmental conservation goals. Such areas may include limitations on pesticide use, soil management practices, and biodiversity preservation efforts. The term \"farming area with environmental restrictions\" serves as a redirect to the preferred term, emphasizing the legal and regulatory importance of these zones in achieving the EU's environmental and agricultural objectives.",
