  "summary": "The \"ECSC opinion\" refers to the formal assessments and recommendations issued by the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) regarding matters pertinent to the coal and steel sectors. Established by the Treaty of Paris in 1951, the ECSC aimed to regulate these industries to promote economic integration and prevent conflict in post-war Europe. The opinions serve as critical regulatory instruments, guiding member states in compliance with EU law and fostering cooperation. Although the ECSC was dissolved in 2002, its legacy continues to influence EU legal frameworks, particularly in the context of industrial policy and market regulation within the broader European construction landscape.",
