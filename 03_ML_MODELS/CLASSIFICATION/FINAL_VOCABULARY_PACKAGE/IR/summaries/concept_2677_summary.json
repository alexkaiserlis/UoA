  "summary": "The concept of \"industrial price\" pertains to the costs associated with goods and services produced within the industrial sector, influencing market dynamics and regulatory frameworks in the EU. It is crucial for assessing competitive practices and ensuring compliance with EU competition law. Industrial prices are often subject to scrutiny under various regulations aimed at preventing anti-competitive behavior and fostering fair market conditions. Understanding industrial price mechanisms is essential for policymakers and regulators to develop effective industrial structures and policies that promote innovation, efficiency, and sustainability within the EU market, ultimately contributing to economic growth and stability.",
