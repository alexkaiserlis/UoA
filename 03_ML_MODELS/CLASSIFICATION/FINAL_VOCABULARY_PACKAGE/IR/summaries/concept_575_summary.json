  "summary": "International criminal law encompasses the legal frameworks and principles governing the prosecution of serious crimes, such as war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity. The European Union, through its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), implements measures to address individuals indicted by tribunals like the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Notable figures such as Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić have been publicly indicted for their roles in the Yugoslav Wars. The EU empowers member states to impose restrictive measures, including freezing assets and detaining individuals, to ensure compliance with international mandates. This legal framework aims to uphold justice and accountability for atrocities committed during conflicts.",
