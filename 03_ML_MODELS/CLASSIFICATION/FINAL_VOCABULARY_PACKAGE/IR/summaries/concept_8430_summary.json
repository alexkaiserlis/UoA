  "summary": "The concept of \"europeanization\" (redirecting to \"europeanisation\") refers to the process through which EU member states align their national laws and regulatory frameworks with European Union standards and directives. This phenomenon encompasses the adoption of EU legislation, policies, and practices, thereby fostering a cohesive legal environment across the Union. Europeanisation facilitates the harmonization of laws, enhancing cooperation among member states and ensuring compliance with EU obligations. It plays a crucial role in the integration of diverse legal systems, promoting uniformity and stability within the internal market, and ultimately advancing the objectives of the European Union.",
