  "summary": "The concept of \"committee procedures,\" commonly referred to as \"comitology,\" encompasses the regulatory framework through which the European Union (EU) enlists various committees to assist in the implementation of legislation. This overarching system reinforces interrelationships among member states and EU institutions, ensuring that decisions are made in a structured manner. By analyzing the voluminous data generated during these procedures, the committees, presided over by appointed interlocutors, embody the collective insights of diverse sectors, including healthcare and finance. The procedures also acknowledge the need for uncoordinated responses to inflationary pressures and other challenges, ultimately sustaining the EU's regulatory integrity while allowing for the merging of ideas from various circles.",
