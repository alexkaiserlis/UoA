  "summary": "Education statistics encompass a broad range of data related to the educational landscape within the EU, focusing on variables such as student demographics, employability, and learning outcomes. These statistics are essential for researchers and policymakers to optimise educational frameworks and adapt curricula to meet evolving workforce demands. The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) provides a codification system that aids in the classification of educational subjects and cycles. By relaunching initiatives that stress the importance of lifelong learning, the EU aims to enhance adaptability and skills among adults. This dynamic approach ensures that educational modules remain relevant, ultimately improving earnings and employability in various domains, including tourism and ICT.",
