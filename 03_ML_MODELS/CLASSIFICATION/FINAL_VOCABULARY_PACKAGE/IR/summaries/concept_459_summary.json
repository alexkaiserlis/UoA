  "summary": "The concept of \"religious intolerance,\" categorized under \"rights and freedoms,\" is redirected to the preferred term \"religious discrimination\" in EU legal and regulatory frameworks. Religious discrimination encompasses acts that unjustly disadvantage individuals based on their religious beliefs, infringing upon fundamental rights guaranteed by EU treaties and directives. The EU actively combats such discrimination through various legal instruments, promoting equality and non-discrimination as core principles. This includes the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which explicitly prohibits discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, thereby reinforcing the commitment to uphold human dignity and foster a pluralistic society.",
