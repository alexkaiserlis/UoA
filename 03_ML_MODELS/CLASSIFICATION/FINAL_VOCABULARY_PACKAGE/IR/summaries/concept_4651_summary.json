  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the concept of \"vehicle\" encompasses a wide range of transport modalities, including those designed for overland and intermodal transport. Vehicles must meet stringent standards for recyclability and recoverability, ensuring that materials can be reused or reconditioned. Regulations often address issues such as overloaded transporters and the use of tachographs to monitor driving times and safety. Additionally, vehicles are subject to maintenance protocols, including the cleansing and disinfecting of components. The evolution of vehicle technology, including thermoelectric systems and advanced braking mechanisms, reflects ongoing efforts to enhance performance and sustainability within the transport sector.",
