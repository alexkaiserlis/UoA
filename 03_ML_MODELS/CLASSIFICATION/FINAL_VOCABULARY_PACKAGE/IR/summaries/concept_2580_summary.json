  "summary": "The \"power of decision\" within the EU political framework refers to the authority vested in specific institutions to act and make binding decisions affecting member states. This power is defined by various legal provisions and protocols, ensuring that decisions are made according to established rules. For instance, a qualified majority is often required, representing a calculated percentage of the population across member states. The procedure for exercising this power is outlined in annexed documents, which may include transitional provisions or amendments. Decisions adopted in this context must be verified and made available to ensure transparency and effective functioning of the EU's legislative framework.",
