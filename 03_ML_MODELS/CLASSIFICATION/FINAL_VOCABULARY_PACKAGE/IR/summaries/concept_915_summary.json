  "summary": "The concept of \"blue Europe,\" redirecting to \"Community fisheries,\" encompasses the EU's legal framework governing sustainable fisheries management. This regulatory approach addresses the disquieting issue of overfished species, such as bluefin and yellowfin tuna, and promotes the sustainable harvesting of benthic and pelagic species, including plaice, haddock, and shrimp. The EU employs various instruments, including booklets and guidelines, to ensure compliance with international agreements like ICCAT and IATTC. By studying the biology and economics of fish stocks, the EU aims to halt overfishing through measures like trawling limits and segmentation of fishing zones. The involvement of plenipotentaries from member states, including Faroese and Burundi representatives, is crucial for effective governance within this communautaire framework.",
