  "summary": "The concept of \"stratum,\" categorized under the coal and mining industries, is a redirect to the preferred term \"ore deposit.\" In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, an ore deposit refers to a naturally occurring concentration of minerals that can be economically extracted. The classification of ore deposits is crucial for regulatory compliance, environmental assessments, and resource management within the mining sector. Understanding the stratification of these deposits aids in the development of sustainable mining practices and informs legislative measures aimed at minimizing ecological impacts. Thus, \"stratum\" serves as a foundational term in the discourse surrounding mineral resource exploitation in the EU.",
