  "summary": "The \"subtropical zone\" refers to a climatic region characterized by warm temperatures and distinct seasonal variations, which is significant in EU environmental regulations. This zone plays a crucial role in biodiversity, influencing the natural environment and ecosystems within EU member states. Legal frameworks, such as the EU Biodiversity Strategy, recognize the importance of protecting subtropical habitats to maintain ecological balance and promote sustainable development. Additionally, the subtropical zone is relevant in discussions on climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, as it is vulnerable to shifts in climatic patterns. Understanding this concept is essential for effective environmental governance within the EU.",
