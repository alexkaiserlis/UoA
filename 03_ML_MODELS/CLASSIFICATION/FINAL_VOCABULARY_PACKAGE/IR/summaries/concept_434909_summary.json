  "summary": "The \"clean development mechanism\" (CDM) is a regulatory instrument established under the Kyoto Protocol, facilitating investment in sustainable development projects in developing countries. Within the EU legal framework, the CDM allows EU member states and companies to earn carbon credits by financing projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions abroad. This mechanism aims to promote environmentally sound technologies while contributing to the EU's climate goals. By integrating the CDM into its emissions trading system, the EU enhances its commitment to international environmental policy, fostering a collaborative approach to combat climate change and advance sustainable development initiatives globally.",
