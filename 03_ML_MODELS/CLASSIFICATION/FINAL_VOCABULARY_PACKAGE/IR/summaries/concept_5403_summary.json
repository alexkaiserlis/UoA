  "summary": "A \"trade agreement (EU)\" is a sui generis legal instrument that emanates from the EUâ€™s regulatory framework, facilitating multiparty negotiations and establishing tariff reductions and trade facilitation measures. These agreements, such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) or the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA), are notable for their crossborder implications and often culminate in extensive attachments detailing specific provisions. The EU engages in these agreements in conjunction with various international partners, including Andean nations and Czechoslovak entities, to promote economic cooperation and reduce hostilities. Subcommittees may oversee compliance with SPS (Sanitary and Phytosanitary) measures, ensuring that trade practices adhere to established standards, while also addressing issues like penalising unfair trade practices.",
