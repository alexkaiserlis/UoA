  "summary": "The concept of \"fair trade\" within the context of EU trade policy encompasses a regulatory framework aimed at promoting equitable trading practices. It seeks to enhance the welfare of producers in developing countries by ensuring they receive fair compensation for their goods, thereby fostering sustainable development. The EU supports fair trade initiatives through various legal instruments, encouraging compliance with ethical standards and transparency in supply chains. This approach not only addresses economic disparities but also aligns with the EU's broader objectives of social responsibility and environmental sustainability, reinforcing the importance of ethical consumerism in international trade relations.",
