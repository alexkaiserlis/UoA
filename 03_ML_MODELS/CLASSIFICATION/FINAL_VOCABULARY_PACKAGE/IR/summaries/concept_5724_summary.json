  "summary": "The concept of \"military manoeuvres\" pertains to organized exercises conducted by armed forces to enhance operational readiness and tactical proficiency. Within the EU legal and regulatory framework, such manoeuvres are significant for fostering defense cooperation among member states. They are often governed by various treaties and agreements that aim to ensure interoperability and collective security. The European Union emphasizes the importance of transparency and accountability in these activities to maintain regional stability. Furthermore, military manoeuvres may be subject to oversight by EU institutions to align with broader defense policies and strategic objectives, reinforcing the EU's commitment to a cohesive defense posture.",
