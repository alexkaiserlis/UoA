  "summary": "The concept of \"political centre\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to a strategic position held by political parties that advocate for moderate and centrist policies. This term is crucial in understanding the dynamics of political representation and governance in the EU, where political parties often align themselves along a spectrum from left to right. The political centre plays a pivotal role in coalition-building, influencing legislative processes, and fostering consensus among diverse political factions. By promoting stability and cooperation, the political centre contributes to the overall functionality of the EU's multi-level governance system, ensuring that various interests are adequately represented in decision-making processes.",
