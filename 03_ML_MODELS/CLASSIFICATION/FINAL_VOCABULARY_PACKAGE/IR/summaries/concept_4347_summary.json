  "summary": "Market surveillance, also referred to as market supervision, is a critical aspect of EU trade policy aimed at ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. It empowers governmental bodies to monitor products and services, capturing data on intended use and authentic quality. This process involves assessing the quantity and safety of goods, including those made from legno and sughero, while addressing restrictions on unwelded piping and other materials. The suddenness of market changes necessitates operationally robust frameworks, which may include outsourcing certain functions to consorzio entities. Market surveillance also involves prudentially managing risks associated with securitisations and proxies, ensuring that all stakeholders, including obligors, adhere to established nomenclature and standards.",
