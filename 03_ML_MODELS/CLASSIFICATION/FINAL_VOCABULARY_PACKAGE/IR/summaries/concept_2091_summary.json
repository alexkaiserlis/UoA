  "summary": "The \"invalidity of an election\" refers to a legal determination that an electoral process has failed to meet established legal standards, rendering the election results null and void. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is crucial for ensuring the integrity of democratic processes. Factors leading to invalidity may include procedural irregularities, violations of electoral laws, or significant discrepancies in voter eligibility. The invalidation process typically involves judicial review or oversight by electoral authorities, ensuring compliance with both national and EU regulations. This mechanism safeguards the principles of democracy and rule of law within the EU electoral landscape.",
