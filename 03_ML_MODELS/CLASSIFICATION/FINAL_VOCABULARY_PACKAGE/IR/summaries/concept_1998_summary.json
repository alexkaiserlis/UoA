  "summary": "The concept of \"political motivation\" pertains to the underlying intentions or reasons that influence political actions and decisions within the EU's legal and regulatory framework. It plays a crucial role in assessing the legitimacy of governmental measures, particularly in contexts involving public safety and political discourse. Understanding political motivation is essential for evaluating compliance with EU principles, such as the rule of law and fundamental rights. In regulatory contexts, it can impact the interpretation of legislation, the enforcement of policies, and the scrutiny of actions taken by public authorities, ensuring that they align with democratic values and transparency standards.",
