  "summary": "The \"power of implementation\" within the EU legal framework refers to the authority conferred upon institutions to transpose directives into national law, ensuring alignment across member states. This conferral of power is crucial for maintaining a coherent political domain, as it assists in the methodological simplifications necessary for effective governance. For instance, when compiling regulations on sweetened jellies or chocolate, the EU must ensure that interpretations are concordant and that outdated provisions are promptly addressed. The deputy role in this process often involves aggregating responses from stakeholders, including consular representatives, to facilitate a vision that is both economical and efficient, particularly in sectors like telecom and agriculture, where products such as cocoa and coffee are regulated.",
