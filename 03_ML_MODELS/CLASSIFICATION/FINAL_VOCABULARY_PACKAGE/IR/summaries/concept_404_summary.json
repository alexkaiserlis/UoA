  "summary": "Depoliticisation refers to the process of removing political influence from decision-making processes, particularly within the context of EU governance and regulatory frameworks. This concept is crucial in ensuring that policies are formulated based on objective criteria rather than political agendas, thereby enhancing transparency and accountability. In EU legal documents, depoliticisation is often linked to the establishment of independent regulatory bodies that operate free from political pressures, ensuring that public safety and political integrity are prioritized. As a redirect term, depoliticisation is synonymous with \"depoliticization,\" emphasizing the importance of maintaining a neutral stance in political discourse and regulatory practices.",
