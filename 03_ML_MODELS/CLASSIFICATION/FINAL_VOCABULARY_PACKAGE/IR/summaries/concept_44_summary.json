  "summary": "Territorial jurisdiction refers to the authority of a legal system to adjudicate matters within a defined geographical area, particularly relevant in the context of the European Union (EU). It is essential for establishing which member states' laws apply to specific cases, especially in commercial and regulatory contexts. The EU's legal framework, including regulations and decisions, often requires member states to implement and communicate modifications to their judicial processes. This concept is crucial for ensuring that documents served by agencies are recognized and enforced across borders. The official journal of the EU publishes relevant information, ensuring transparency and consistency in the application of territorial jurisdiction among member states.",
