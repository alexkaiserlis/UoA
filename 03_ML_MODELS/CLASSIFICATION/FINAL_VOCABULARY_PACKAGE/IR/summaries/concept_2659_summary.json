  "summary": "The \"withdrawal price\" in EU regulatory context refers to the price at which certain products, such as monkfish, anchovies, and sardines, are removed from the market to stabilize fluctuating market conditions. This mechanism is essential for managing the interdependence of fishery resources, ensuring the freshness of landed products like prawns and herring. By publicizing withdrawal prices, authorities can mitigate the risks of penalized overfishing and disallowed catches. The system allows for the collation of receipts and presents a framework for compensatory indemnities, justifiably addressing the needs of fishers facing realignments in market demand. Ultimately, it aims to reforming practices that contribute to sustainable fisheries management.",
