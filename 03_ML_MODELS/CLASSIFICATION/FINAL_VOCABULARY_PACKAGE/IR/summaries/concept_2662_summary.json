  "summary": "The term \"support price\" refers to a regulatory mechanism within the European Union's agricultural policy framework, specifically aimed at stabilizing market prices for certain agricultural products. This price is established to provide a safety net for farmers, ensuring that their income remains viable despite market fluctuations. By setting a minimum price, the EU seeks to protect agricultural producers from excessive price volatility and to promote food security. The support price is a critical component of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), influencing market dynamics and contributing to the overall economic stability of the agricultural sector within the EU.",
