  "summary": "\"Paid leave\" refers to a statutory entitlement within the framework of EU labor law, aimed at ensuring workers receive remuneration during periods of absence from work due to various reasons, such as illness, maternity, or personal emergencies. This concept is integral to the organization of work and working conditions, as it promotes employee welfare and job security. EU directives, such as the Working Time Directive, establish minimum standards for paid leave, thereby enhancing the quality of life for workers across member states. The regulatory framework surrounding paid leave underscores the EU's commitment to balancing work-life dynamics and fostering equitable labor practices.",
