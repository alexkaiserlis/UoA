  "summary": "The concept of \"integrated trade\" within the EU regulatory framework refers to a comprehensive approach that harmonizes various distributive trades across member states. This integration aims to facilitate seamless cross-border transactions, enhance market access, and promote economic cohesion. By aligning regulatory standards and practices, integrated trade seeks to eliminate barriers that hinder the free movement of goods and services. This concept is crucial for fostering competitive markets and ensuring consumer protection while adhering to EU legal principles. As such, integrated trade plays a vital role in the broader context of the EU's internal market strategy, promoting efficiency and sustainability in distributive trades.",
