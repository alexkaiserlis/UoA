  "summary": "A \"sample survey\" is a judicious method employed in economic analysis within EU legal and regulatory frameworks. It facilitates the collection of data from selected populations, such as immigrants and disabled individuals, to inform policy decisions. The Eurobarometer and other datasets, like the ESaw and EODS, utilize sample surveys to tabulate attitudes across various domains, including employment and social integration. These surveys are crucial for understanding the impact of policies on different sexes and occupations, aiding in the mainstreaming of flexicurity principles. By synchronizing data collection efforts, such as biennial censuses, the EU can address skill shortages and enhance adaptability for migrants and their descendants.",
