  "summary": "The concept of \"self-driving vehicle,\" redirected to the preferred term \"autonomous vehicle,\" pertains to the organization of transport within the European Union's regulatory framework. Autonomous vehicles are defined as vehicles capable of navigating and operating without human intervention, which raises significant legal and regulatory considerations. The EU is actively developing legislation to ensure safety, liability, and data protection related to these vehicles. This includes establishing standards for testing, certification, and integration into existing transport systems. The regulatory landscape aims to facilitate innovation while safeguarding public interests and ensuring compliance with EU transport policies.",
