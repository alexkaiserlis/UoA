  "summary": "The concept of \"women's organisation,\" categorized under politics and public safety, is redirected to the preferred term \"women's movement.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, women's movements play a crucial role in advocating for gender equality and influencing policy development. These organisations mobilize resources to address issues affecting women, such as discrimination and violence, thereby contributing to the formulation of legislation that promotes women's rights. The EU recognizes the importance of these movements in fostering inclusive governance and ensuring that women's voices are represented in political discourse, ultimately enhancing public safety and societal well-being.",
