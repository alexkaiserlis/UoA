  "summary": "Group farming refers to a collaborative farming system where multiple farmers unite to manage resources, share risks, and enhance productivity. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, group farming is recognized for its potential to foster sustainable agricultural practices and improve market access for small-scale producers. The EU encourages such cooperative structures through various policies aimed at promoting rural development and ensuring food security. By facilitating collective bargaining and resource pooling, group farming can enhance competitiveness and resilience in the agricultural sector, aligning with the EU's objectives of sustainable growth and rural cohesion.",
