  "summary": "The concept of \"vehicle fleet\" within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to a collection of vehicles owned or operated by an entity, typically for commercial or public transport purposes. Regulations governing vehicle fleets are crucial for ensuring compliance with environmental standards, safety protocols, and operational efficiency. The EU has established directives that mandate the monitoring of emissions and the implementation of sustainable practices within vehicle fleets. This concept is integral to land transport policies, influencing legislation aimed at reducing carbon footprints and promoting the transition to greener transport solutions across member states.",
