  "summary": "The \"information society\" concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks emphasises the advancement of ICTs, which are pivotal in a globalised era. It highlights the importance of digital literacy, accommodating diverse societal needs, and ensuring that all households can access online services. The EU's flagship initiatives aim to equip citizens with the necessary skills to navigate this landscape, while also benchmarking progress through various metrics. As the information society evolves, it invites stakeholders to engage in interviews and discussions, addressing uneven access and the potential for injuries related to digital interactions. The concept serves as a framework for understanding the implications of ICTs on everyday life, including the need for regulatory measures to protect users from risks associated with online environments.",
