  "summary": "The concept of \"trafficking in organs,\" redirected to \"trade in organs,\" pertains to serious criminal activities involving the illicit procurement and sale of human organs. Within the EU legal and regulatory framework, this issue is addressed through various policies aimed at combating such practices, which deteriorate human rights and impede judicial proceedings. The EU's external action, particularly under the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), includes missions like Eulex in Kosovo, aimed at enhancing security and providing legal support. The objectives extend to establishing arrangements that cover the high amount of illegal activities, ensuring that all stages of action are conducted in line with EU law and political conclusions. This comprehensive approach reflects the EU's commitment to safeguarding human dignity and achieving effective legal outcomes in this critical area of social affairs.",
