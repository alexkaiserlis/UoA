  "summary": "The concept of a \"peace zone\" within the context of EU international security pertains to designated maritime areas where fishing activities are regulated to ensure sustainable exploitation of fish stocks. These zones aim to enhance conservation efforts by prohibiting certain fishing practices, thereby protecting exhausted resources and maintaining biodiversity. Jurisdiction over these zones is typically allocated to member states, which may impose quotas on vessels registered under their flag. The EU's common fisheries policy outlines the management of these zones, ensuring that fishing opportunities are distributed fairly among countries, while also addressing the retention of catches and transhipment practices to prevent illegal exploitation of marine resources.",
