  "summary": "The concept of \"geological time\" pertains to the extensive chronological framework used to understand Earth's history, encompassing significant geological and biological events. In the context of EU legal and regulatory documents, geological time is crucial for environmental assessments, particularly in relation to natural resource management and biodiversity conservation. Regulations such as the Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive often reference geological time to assess the impact of human activities on ecosystems over extended periods. Understanding geological time aids in formulating sustainable policies that consider long-term environmental changes, thereby ensuring compliance with EU environmental legislation and promoting ecological resilience.",
