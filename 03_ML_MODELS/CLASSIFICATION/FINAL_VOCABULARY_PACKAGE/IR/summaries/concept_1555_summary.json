  "summary": "The \"Kingdom of Cambodia,\" redirected to the preferred term \"Cambodia,\" is significant in EU legal and regulatory contexts, particularly concerning economic geography. Phnom Penh, the capital, plays a central role in Cambodia's garment industry, which is influenced by ASEAN trade agreements. The EU has engaged in forums addressing issues like the demobilisation of combatants and the alleviation of poverty, focusing on sustainable practices in sectors such as fishing, where species like thunnus and xiphias are regulated. Additionally, the EU's commitment to combat unregulated fishing practices, including longline methods, reflects its broader objectives of environmental protection and disarmament. The relationship with Cambodia also involves discussions on trade and human rights, where the EU seeks to mediate and influence regulatory frameworks.",
