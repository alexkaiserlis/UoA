  "summary": "The term \"archipelago\" in the context of international law refers to a group of islands that may have specific legal implications under EU regulations. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides a framework for the rights of archipelagic states, which can influence EU maritime policy and territorial waters. This concept is essential for understanding the legal status of maritime boundaries, resource management, and environmental protection within EU waters. The regulatory framework governing archipelagos is crucial for ensuring compliance with international treaties and fostering cooperation among member states in maritime governance.",
