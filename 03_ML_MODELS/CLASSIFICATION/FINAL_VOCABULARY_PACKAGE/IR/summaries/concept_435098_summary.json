  "summary": "Therapeutic cloning, often referred to as human cloning in EU legal and regulatory contexts, pertains to the use of cloning technologies for medical purposes, particularly in regenerative medicine. The European Union has established stringent regulations surrounding cloning practices to address ethical concerns and potential risks associated with human cloning. This concept is critical in discussions about biotechnological advancements and their implications for human rights and dignity. The redirect from \"therapeutic cloning\" to \"human cloning\" underscores the EU's focus on the broader ethical and legal ramifications of cloning technologies, ensuring that any advancements align with fundamental rights and public health considerations.",
