  "summary": "A \"delegated regulation\" is a legal instrument within the framework of European Union law, allowing the European Commission to supplement or amend non-essential elements of legislative acts. This process is governed by Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Delegated regulations enable the Commission to ensure uniformity and adaptability in implementing EU legislation, particularly in areas requiring technical updates or detailed provisions. They are subject to scrutiny by the European Parliament and the Council, ensuring democratic oversight while facilitating efficient regulatory adaptation to evolving circumstances within the EU legal landscape.",
