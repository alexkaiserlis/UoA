  "summary": "Corrosion is a significant factor contributing to the deterioration of the environment, particularly within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks. It refers to the gradual degradation of materials, especially metals, due to chemical reactions with their environment. This process can lead to substantial economic losses and environmental harm, prompting the EU to implement directives aimed at mitigating its impacts. Regulations addressing corrosion focus on promoting sustainable practices, enhancing material resilience, and ensuring compliance with environmental standards. By understanding corrosion's implications, the EU seeks to protect both natural resources and public health, fostering a more sustainable future.",
