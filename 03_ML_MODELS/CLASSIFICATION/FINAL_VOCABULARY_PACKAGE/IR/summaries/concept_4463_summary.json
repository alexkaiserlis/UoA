  "summary": "The term \"trade bill\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"negotiable instrument\" within the context of EU monetary economics. A trade bill refers to a financial document that represents an agreement between parties for the payment of a specified sum, typically used in commercial transactions. As a negotiable instrument, it facilitates the transfer of funds and can be endorsed or assigned to third parties, enhancing liquidity in financial markets. In EU regulatory frameworks, trade bills are governed by specific directives that ensure their validity and enforceability, thereby promoting stability and confidence in cross-border trade and financial operations.",
