  "summary": "A \"consumer survey\" in the EU regulatory context refers to a systematic method of collecting data to ascertain consumer preferences and behaviors regarding products, particularly in sectors like food and nutrition. These surveys promote transparency and reliability in understanding dietary habits, including the utilization of additives and flavourings. By compiling data on incidents of contamination and the nutritional value of products, regulatory bodies can ensure compliance with standardized safety measures. The expertise gathered from these surveys aids in planning and formulating policies that address consumer needs while facing constraints such as underfished resources and toxicological concerns. Ultimately, consumer surveys contribute to the accomplishment of optimal market conditions and informed decision-making.",
