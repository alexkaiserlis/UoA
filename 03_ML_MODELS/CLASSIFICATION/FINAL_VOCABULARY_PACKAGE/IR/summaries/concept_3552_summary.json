The EU's rahmenplan promotes the improvement of regional economic structures by enhancing teleworking opportunities, particularly for disadvantaged groups. By investing in skilled manpower and connecting specialists across länder, teleworking can diminish underemployment and stabilize GDP. Consequently, it is an attractive scenario for both employees and investors, fostering a more resilient workforce.",
