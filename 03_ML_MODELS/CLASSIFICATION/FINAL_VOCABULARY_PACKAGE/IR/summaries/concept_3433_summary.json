  "summary": "The term \"napalm\" is categorized under \"defence\" and is a redirect to the preferred term \"incendiary weapon.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, incendiary weapons are subject to strict regulations due to their potential for causing excessive harm and suffering. The use of such weapons is often scrutinized under international humanitarian law, particularly in relation to the principles of distinction and proportionality in armed conflict. The EU actively engages in discussions and treaties aimed at regulating the use of incendiary weapons, reflecting its commitment to uphold human rights and mitigate the humanitarian impact of warfare.",
