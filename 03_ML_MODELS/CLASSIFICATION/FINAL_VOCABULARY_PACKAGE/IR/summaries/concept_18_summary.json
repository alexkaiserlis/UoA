  "summary": "The term \"parliamentary sub-committee\" refers to a specialized body within a parliamentary committee, tasked with addressing specific issues or legislative proposals in greater detail. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these sub-committees play a crucial role in the legislative process, allowing for in-depth examination and discussion of complex matters. This concept is a redirect to the preferred term \"parliamentary committee,\" which encompasses both the main committees and their sub-committees. By facilitating focused dialogue and expertise, parliamentary committees enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the EU's legislative functions.",
