  "summary": "Paedophilia, categorized under criminal law within EU legal frameworks, refers to the sexual attraction of adults towards prepubescent children. The European Union has established various legal instruments aimed at combating this heinous crime, including directives that mandate member states to implement stringent laws against child exploitation and abuse. These regulations emphasize the importance of protecting minors and ensuring that offenders face severe penalties. Additionally, the EU promotes cross-border cooperation among law enforcement agencies to effectively address paedophilia, recognizing its transnational nature. The legal discourse surrounding paedophilia reflects a commitment to safeguarding children's rights and welfare across member states.",
