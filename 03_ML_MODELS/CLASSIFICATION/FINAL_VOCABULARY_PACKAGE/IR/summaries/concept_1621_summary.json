This right is enshrined in various EU treaties and directives, reflecting the Union's commitment to uphold democratic principles and protect civil liberties. Freedom of communication is essential for fostering public discourse, enabling the free flow of ideas, and ensuring transparency in governance. It is intricately linked to other rights and freedoms, such as freedom of expression and the right to access information, thereby reinforcing the EU's regulatory landscape aimed at promoting an open and pluralistic society.",
