  "summary": "A \"voluntary restraint agreement\" (VRA) is a regulatory arrangement in international trade, where exporting countries, such as Argentina and Australia, agree to limit the quantity of goods, like mutton and sheepmeat, exported to the EU. These agreements aim to stabilize markets and sustain community interests by preventing excessive imports that could disrupt local industries. VRAs often involve negotiations specifying tariffs and levies, with parties subscribing to terms that may include alterations in export weightings. Historically, nations like Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia have engaged in such arrangements, ensuring that trade practices align with EU regulatory frameworks while fostering cooperation among shareholders in the global market.",
