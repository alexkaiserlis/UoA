  "summary": "Geopolitics, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the interplay of geographical factors and political power dynamics that influence the formulation of policies and international relations. This concept is crucial for understanding the EU's strategic positioning in global affairs, particularly in areas such as trade agreements, security cooperation, and environmental regulations. The EU's geopolitical strategies often reflect its commitment to multilateralism and regional stability, impacting legislative initiatives and regulatory measures. By analyzing geopolitical trends, EU institutions can better navigate complex international landscapes, ensuring that legal frameworks align with broader political objectives and member states' interests.",
