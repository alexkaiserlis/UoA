  "summary": "The concept of \"legal theory,\" redirecting to \"interpretation of the law,\" encompasses various frameworks for understanding legal principles within the EU context. It comprises codified rules and protocols that govern disputes, such as those arising under the WTO framework, including the DSU and DSB mechanisms. Legal theory informs the rationality behind rulings on matters like subsidies for agricultural products, including tomatoes and peppers, and the settlement of disputes over dumped goods. The interpretation of law is essential for consistent application across member states, including the Hellenic and Benelux regions, ensuring that contractual obligations are met and that community standards are upheld in a phased manner.",
