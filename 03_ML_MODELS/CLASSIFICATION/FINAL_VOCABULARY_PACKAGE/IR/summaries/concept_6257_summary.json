  "summary": "The concept of \"simplifying legislation,\" also referred to as the \"simplification of legislation,\" is crucial within EU legal frameworks. It aims to reduce burdensome regulatory requirements, thereby enhancing the efficiency of legal processes. This simplification is essential for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and contractors, who often face complex legal structures that can hinder their operations. By scrutinising existing laws and eliminating obsolete provisions, the EU can foster a more structured and coordinated approach to legislation. This agenda not only provokes discussions among stakeholders but also ensures that legal entitlements are clear and accessible, ultimately leading to significant savings and reduced hazards for all involved.",
