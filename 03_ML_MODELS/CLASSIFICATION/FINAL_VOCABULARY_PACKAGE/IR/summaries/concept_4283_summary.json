  "summary": "The concept of \"economic contingency stock\" within the framework of EU trade policy refers to strategic reserves of essential goods maintained to mitigate the impact of economic disruptions. These stocks are crucial for ensuring market stability and safeguarding supply chains during crises, such as natural disasters or geopolitical tensions. The regulatory framework governing economic contingency stocks emphasizes the importance of preparedness and resilience in trade practices. By establishing such reserves, the EU aims to enhance its economic sovereignty and protect consumers from volatility in global markets. This concept underscores the intersection of trade policy and economic security within the EU's legal landscape.",
