  "summary": "The \"research programme\" concept within EU legal and regulatory frameworks embodies a structured approach to fostering innovation and development across various sectors. These programmes are often quadripartite, involving collaboration among academia, industry, government, and civil society. They catalysed advancements in fields such as oceanography and informatics, while addressing health issues like thrombosis and leucoses. By embracing an inexhaustible quest for knowledge, these initiatives support the predesign of projects like tokamaks and stellarators, which are pivotal for sustainable energy. The programmes also promote psychosocial well-being and environmental sustainability, ensuring that mankind benefits from a holistic, conceptual development strategy that dovetails with EU objectives.",
