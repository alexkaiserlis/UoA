  "summary": "The \"multiparty system\" is a political framework characterized by the presence of multiple political parties competing for power within a democratic context. In the European Union (EU), this system enhances pluralism and representation, allowing diverse political ideologies to coexist and influence governance. Legal and regulatory documents often reference the multiparty system to underscore the importance of democratic principles, electoral integrity, and citizen participation in decision-making processes. This framework is essential for fostering dialogue and consensus-building among various stakeholders, ensuring that minority voices are heard and contributing to the overall stability and legitimacy of the EU's political landscape.",
