  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"economic indicator\" serves as a crucial tool for assessing economic performance and stability. These indicators, which are compiled and disclosed by various institutions, align with classifications such as NACE and are essential for stakeholders in the banking and maritime sectors. The predictive nature of these indicators allows for the analysis of variables that coincide with economic cycles, prompting timely interventions. Furthermore, the ESIF and EMFF programs utilize these indicators to prioritize funding and programming efforts, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively. The transparency of these indicators enhances comparability across domains, reinforcing the prudential oversight mandated by Basel regulations.",
