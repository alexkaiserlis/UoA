  "summary": "The \"Kennedy Round\" refers to a significant multilateral trade negotiation that took place under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) during the 1960s. It aimed to reduce tariffs and expand international trade, influencing the EU's tariff policy framework established in 2011. The outcomes of the Kennedy Round contributed to shaping the EU's regulatory approach towards trade liberalization and the establishment of common external tariffs. This historical context underscores the importance of international negotiations in formulating EU trade policies, which continue to evolve in response to global economic dynamics.",
