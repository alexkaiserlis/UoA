  "summary": "Share-cropping, also referred to as \"share farming,\" is a farming system characterized by an agreement between landowners and farmers, where the latter cultivate the land in exchange for a share of the crop yield. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, share farming arrangements are subject to various agricultural policies and regulations that aim to ensure fair practices and sustainable farming. The concept is particularly relevant in discussions surrounding rural development, land tenure, and agricultural productivity. As a redirect to \"share farming,\" it highlights the importance of collaborative agricultural practices within the EU's regulatory landscape, promoting equitable resource distribution and enhancing food security.",
