  "summary": "Criminal law within the EU framework rationalises the multifaceted approach to combating crime, particularly in areas like drug trafficking and xenophobia. It emphasises the importance of a multidisciplinary judiciary that can address the geographic dimensions of crime, ensuring that victims receive genuine support. The Tampere and Feira conclusions have helped to boost partnerships among Member States, fostering a collective endeavour to improve legal responses. By complementing national laws with EU conventions, the legal landscape is stepped up to tackle issues such as racism and drug-related crimes. This framework is funded to enhance accessibility and effectiveness, ensuring that all counterparts can accede to a safer society.",
