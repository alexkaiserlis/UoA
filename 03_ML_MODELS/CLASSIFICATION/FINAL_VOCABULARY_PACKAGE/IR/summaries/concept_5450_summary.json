  "summary": "\"Administrative autonomy\" within the EU legal framework refers to the capacity of public authorities to conduct their tasks independently, particularly in the context of foreign affairs and security policy (CFSP). This autonomy entails the ability to implement policies and engage in democratic reforms without undue external interference. It aims to support the achievement of objectives outlined in various modalities of action, particularly in regions like the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The extension of administrative autonomy is crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of missions, as it allows for tailored assistance and advice, ultimately improving the situation and facilitating future transitions in governance.",
