  "summary": "Citizen science refers to the involvement of the general public in scientific research, often facilitated by digital platforms. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, citizen science plays a crucial role in promoting open access to research and fostering public engagement in scientific inquiry. The European Union encourages citizen science initiatives to enhance data collection, contribute to environmental monitoring, and support policy-making processes. By integrating citizen contributions, the EU aims to democratize knowledge production and ensure that research aligns with societal needs. This approach also raises considerations regarding intellectual property rights and data governance, necessitating clear regulatory guidelines.",
