This committee, mandated to promote innovative entrepreneurship and mobilise resources, plays a vital role in the implementation of the Cotonou Agreement. It facilitates the orderly evolution of partnerships, enabling the delegation of expertise and mechanisms to advance jobs and income for SMEs. By adopting effective modalities, the committee fosters collaboration among various actors, including ministers and organisations, to create considerable capacity for development and innovation in ACP regions, particularly in sessions held in cities like Nairobi and Busan.",
