  "summary": "The term \"Far Eastern countries,\" a redirect to the preferred term \"Far East,\" encompasses a diverse region characterized by industrialised nations and emerging economies. In EU legal and regulatory contexts, this designation often relates to trade agreements and protectionist measures that influence economic interactions. Countries such as Bangkok, Yokohama, and Inchon are pivotal in shaping trade dynamics. The EU's regulatory framework may include provisions for refillable products, such as lighters and tuners, which are prevalent in these markets. As global trade progresses, the EU must navigate complexities, including exacerbated competition and the need for sound policies that outweigh protectionist tendencies.",
