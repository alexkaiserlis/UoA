In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, child labour is addressed through various directives and regulations aimed at protecting the rights of children. The EU promotes strict enforcement of minimum age requirements for employment and advocates for the eradication of exploitative practices. Member States are encouraged to implement robust measures to combat child labour, ensuring compliance with international standards, such as those set by the International Labour Organization (ILO). The EU's commitment to safeguarding children's welfare is reflected in its comprehensive policies and monitoring mechanisms.",
