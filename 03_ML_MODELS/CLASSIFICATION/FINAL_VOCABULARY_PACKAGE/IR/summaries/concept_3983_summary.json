  "summary": "The term \"commercial tribunal\" is a redirect to \"commercial court,\" which is integral to the organization of the legal system within the EU. These courts are involved in proceedings related to commercial disputes, including insolvency and winding-up processes. In various member states, such as Latvia, Denmark, and Ireland, commercial courts operate under codified legislation, ensuring legal certainty for parties involved. The functioning of these courts is bound by national laws and EU regulations, which may include amendments and notifications pursuant to specific protocols. The adoption of relevant articles and annexes provides a comprehensive framework for the effective handling of commercial disputes across the United Kingdom and other member states.",
