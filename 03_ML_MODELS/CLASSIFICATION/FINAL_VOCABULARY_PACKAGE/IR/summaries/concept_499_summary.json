  "summary": "In EU civil law, \"damages\" refers to monetary compensation awarded to a party for loss or injury resulting from another party's wrongful act or negligence. The concept is pivotal in tort law, where the aggrieved party seeks redress through judicial proceedings. Damages aim to restore the injured party to their pre-injury position, encompassing both pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses. The EU regulatory framework emphasizes the need for effective remedies, ensuring that victims can obtain adequate compensation. This principle underlines the importance of liability and accountability within the internal market, fostering a fair and just legal environment across member states.",
