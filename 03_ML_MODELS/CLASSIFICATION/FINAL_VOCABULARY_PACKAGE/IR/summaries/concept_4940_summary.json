  "summary": "The term \"biosphere\" refers to the global sum of all ecosystems, encompassing the interactions between living organisms and their natural environment. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the biosphere is crucial for understanding biodiversity conservation, environmental sustainability, and climate change mitigation. EU directives, such as the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive, aim to protect various components of the biosphere by establishing protected areas and promoting sustainable practices. The biosphere's health is integral to achieving the EU's environmental objectives, including the European Green Deal, which seeks to enhance ecological resilience and combat biodiversity loss across member states.",
