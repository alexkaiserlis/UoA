  "summary": "The \"photographic industry\" encompasses a range of activities related to the production and processing of photographic materials, including sensitized films and unexposed photographic papers. It involves various processes such as photolithogravure and photocopying, which utilize wavelengths of light to create images. Regulatory frameworks in the EU address aspects like the use of photosensitive materials and the safety of equipment, including cathodic devices and pulverizers. The industry also engages in the production of microfilm and microfiches for archival purposes. Additionally, companies like Kodak and Adox play significant roles in reselling photographic products, while innovations in technologies such as flashlight photography and radiography continue to evolve within this sector.",
