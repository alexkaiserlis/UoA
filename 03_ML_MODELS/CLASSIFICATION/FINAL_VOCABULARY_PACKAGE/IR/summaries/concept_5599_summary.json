  "summary": "The concept of \"regional legislation,\" redirected to the preferred term \"regional law,\" pertains to the legal frameworks established by subnational entities within the European Union. Regional law encompasses statutes, regulations, and directives enacted by regional authorities, reflecting the unique socio-economic and cultural contexts of specific areas. These legal instruments play a crucial role in the implementation of EU policies at the local level, ensuring compliance with overarching EU law while addressing regional needs. The interplay between regional law and EU legislation illustrates the multi-layered structure of governance in the EU, highlighting the significance of regional autonomy in the legal landscape.",
