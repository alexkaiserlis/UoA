  "summary": "Harmonisation law refers to the legal framework established within the European Union to create uniformity among member states' laws and regulations. This concept is pivotal in facilitating the internal market by reducing disparities that may hinder cross-border trade and cooperation. Through directives and regulations, harmonisation law aims to align national legislation with EU standards, ensuring consistency in areas such as consumer protection, environmental regulations, and product safety. By promoting legal coherence, harmonisation law enhances legal certainty and fosters a competitive environment, ultimately contributing to the EU's objectives of integration and economic cohesion among its member states.",
