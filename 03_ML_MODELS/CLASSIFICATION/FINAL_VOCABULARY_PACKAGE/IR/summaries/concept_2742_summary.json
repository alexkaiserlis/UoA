  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, a \"pre-packed product,\" redirecting to the preferred term \"packaged product,\" refers to items that are standardized for retail, often stripped of unnecessary packaging materials to enhance usability. This includes various household goods, such as infant formulae and food items like apples, which are carefully catalogued for consumer clarity. Regulations mandate that these products meet specific moisture and atmospheric conditions during transportation to ensure quality. Retailers must understand the norms governing these packaged items, which include provisions for waiving certain requirements under defined circumstances. The concept emphasizes the importance of transparency and comparability in consumer goods.",
