  "summary": "The \"UN Trusteeship Council,\" a pivotal organ of the United Nations, was established to oversee the administration of Trust Territories and ensure their transition to self-governance. Although its functions have diminished since the last territory was granted independence, the Council's legacy continues to influence international legal frameworks and regulatory practices. In the context of EU legal documents, the principles of self-determination and governance that the Council championed resonate with the EU's commitment to human rights and democratic values. As a redirect to the preferred term \"UN Trusteeship Council,\" this concept underscores the EU's engagement with global governance structures.",
