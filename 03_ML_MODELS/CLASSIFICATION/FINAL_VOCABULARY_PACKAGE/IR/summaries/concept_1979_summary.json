  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, a \"trading monopoly,\" redirected to the preferred term \"monopoly,\" refers to a dominant market position held by a single entity, often leading to abusive practices. Such monopolies can compel airlines to engage in unfair pricing or discriminated service provisions, particularly in airports. Regulatory bodies may impose fines on companies that engage in quasi-legal practices, alleging that they intentionally abuse their dominant status. Complaints often arise regarding the refusal to provide justifiable services, such as baggage handling or cleaning, which can lead to penalties for non-compliance. The EU aims to uphold competition by interpreting these monopolistic behaviors through stringent regulations.",
