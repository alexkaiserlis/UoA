The integration of economic strategies in urban planning is essential for fostering resilience and enhancing the quality of life in cities. Regulatory instruments, such as the Urban Agenda for the EU, aim to address challenges related to urbanization, ensuring that economic growth aligns with environmental sustainability and social inclusion.
