  "summary": "The concept of \"market stabilisation,\" previously referred to as \"stabilization of prices,\" is pivotal in EU trade policy, particularly regarding agricultural products like chickpeas and lentils. This regulatory framework aims to regularize market conditions, ensuring that harvesters can optimize their yields without succumbing to unsustainable price fluctuations. By reactivating mechanisms that adjust prices, the EU seeks to deepen market objectiveness and mitigate mismatches in supply and demand. Initiatives may include the replanting of vetches and other legumes, which can propagate stability. The approach is wise, as it allows for a gradient of support that can suddenly address crises, ensuring that the agricultural sector remains resilient and robust.",
