  "summary": "The \"invisible trade balance\" refers to the transactions that occur in the EU market, whereal the movement of capital and services is governed by specific regulations. This concept appears in the context of liberalising trade, where restrictions on foreign transfers are progressively abolished. It requires authorisations for certain transactions, ensuring that residents can freely engage in economic activities. The relevant directives facilitate the establishment of a high level of freedom in capital exchange, addressing social and economic grounds. As such, the invisible trade balance is crucial for understanding the transitional stages of market liberalisation and the overall economic situation within the EU.",
