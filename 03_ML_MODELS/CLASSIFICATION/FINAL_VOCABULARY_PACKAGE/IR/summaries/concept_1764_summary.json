  "summary": "The concept of \"disaffection of young people\" pertains to the growing disengagement and alienation experienced by youth within the EU, particularly in the context of social affairs. This phenomenon is often linked to socio-economic challenges, including unemployment and lack of opportunities, which can lead to a sense of disenfranchisement. EU legal and regulatory frameworks aim to address these issues through initiatives that promote social inclusion, youth participation, and empowerment. By fostering engagement in civic activities and providing access to education and employment, the EU seeks to mitigate disaffection and enhance the overall well-being of young people across member states.",
