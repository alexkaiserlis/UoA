  "summary": "The concept of \"noise level\" pertains to the deterioration of the environment, specifically focusing on the audible impact of various appliances and activities. In EU legal and regulatory frameworks, noise levels are meticulously measured and optimized to prevent nuisances in populated environments. Regulations often categorize noise sources, such as motorcycles, aeroplanes, and lawnmowers, and employ measures to diminish their impact. Devices like silencers and compressors are designed to obviate excessive noise. Standards set by CENELEC guide the assessment of acoustic emissions, ensuring that powerful equipment, including dishwashers and conditioners, operates within acceptable limits, thereby protecting public health and enhancing quality of life.",
