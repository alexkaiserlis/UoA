  "summary": "The concept of \"consumer motivation\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to understanding the underlying factors that drive consumer behavior in the context of consumption. This includes the need to locate and adapt policies that promote sustainable practices in industries such as fisheries and aquaculture. By authorizing standardized schemes, the EU aims to improve market structures and lower prices for consumers while ensuring that surplus products, like butter and milk, are managed efficiently. Legal arrangements may also involve reimbursement for qualifying projects that assist consumers in making informed choices, thereby enhancing overall consumption patterns and expenditure.",
