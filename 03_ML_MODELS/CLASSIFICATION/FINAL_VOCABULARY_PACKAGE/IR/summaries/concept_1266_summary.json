  "summary": "Heavy oil, categorized under the oil industry, is a viscous hydrocarbon product characterized by its high density and viscosity. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, heavy oil undergoes various processes such as neutralization and decolourization to enhance its purity. Regulatory bodies require notifiers to submit detailed dossiers that include toxicological assessments and confirmatory studies. The purification processes often involve activated charcoal and sodium hydroxide to filter impurities. Heavy oil's environmental impact is scrutinized, particularly regarding its carbon emissions and potential toxicity. The liberalization of the oil market necessitates careful monitoring of these substances to ensure compliance with pharmacopoeia standards and safety regulations.",
