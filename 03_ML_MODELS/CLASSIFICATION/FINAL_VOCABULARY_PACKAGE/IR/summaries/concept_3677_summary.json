  "summary": "The concept of \"trusteeship\" in international law pertains to the governance of \"dependent territory,\" a term that signifies regions under the administration of another state or entity, often established through international agreements. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, trusteeship arrangements may involve oversight mechanisms to ensure the protection of the rights and interests of the inhabitants of such territories. The EU's approach to dependent territories reflects its commitment to international cooperation and the promotion of self-determination, aligning with broader principles of international law. As a redirect, \"trusteeship\" is synonymous with \"dependent territory,\" emphasizing the legal responsibilities associated with such governance.",
