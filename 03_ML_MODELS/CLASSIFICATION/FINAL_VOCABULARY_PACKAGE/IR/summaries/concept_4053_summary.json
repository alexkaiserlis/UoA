  "summary": "The \"third Lomé Convention,\" signed in Brussels on December 18, 1984, represents a significant agreement between the European Economic Communities (EEC) and African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) states. This convention, which acceded to earlier treaties, aimed to enhance economic cooperation and development aid. It established a framework for financing projects and consulting on internal administration issues. Articles of the convention, referred to hereinafter, detail the obligations of member states, including Spain and Portugal, in supporting ACP republics. The decision to amend the convention was formalized in subsequent meetings, notably in January and June, reinforcing the EU's commitment to fostering economic ties.",
