  "summary": "The concept of \"percentage of profits,\" which redirects to \"income in addition to normal pay,\" pertains to personnel management and staff remuneration within EU regulatory frameworks. This income is calculated periodically and may reflect various classifications of workload and tasks undertaken by employees. Agencies may levy charges or fees based on performance, enhancing the overall remuneration structure. The calculation of this income involves a refined formula that ensures fair validation of earnings. Applicants for such remuneration must provide certificates that detail incurred costs and tasks carried out. This ensures transparency and compliance with EU regulations, fostering a true enterprise environment.",
