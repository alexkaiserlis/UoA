  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"dictatorship\" refers to a political system where authority is concentrated in a single entity or group, often undermining democratic principles. The EU actively combats such regimes through its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), which includes measures against listed entities involved in terrorism or human rights violations. Statements regarding ongoing situations are regularly updated, and the EU reviews its position on these groups, applying restrictive measures as necessary. Competent authorities communicate decisions to appeal or repeal sanctions, ensuring that involved persons are informed of the reasons for their status. This comprehensive approach aims to uphold democratic values and combat the implications of dictatorship within and beyond EU borders.",
