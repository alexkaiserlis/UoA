  "summary": "The concept of \"available energy resources\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework encompasses the diverse range of energy sources that can be harnessed to meet the Union's energy policy objectives. This includes renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and biomass, as well as conventional sources like natural gas and coal. The EU's energy policy aims to ensure a secure, sustainable, and competitive energy supply, promoting the efficient utilization of these available energy resources. Regulatory measures, such as the Renewable Energy Directive, facilitate the integration and optimization of these resources, thereby supporting the transition towards a low-carbon economy and enhancing energy security across member states.",
