  "summary": "In the context of EU transport policy, \"vehicle papers,\" redirected to the preferred term \"vehicle documents,\" encompass essential regulatory materials such as the livret for automobiles and tachygraph records. These documents are crucial for ensuring roadworthiness and compliance with regulations governing the transiting of vehicles across borders, particularly within the framework of the ECMT. They facilitate the tracking of journey details, including kilometres travelled and load specifications. Additionally, vehicle documents support the management of crews and their manning, while also addressing environmentally sustainable practices through initiatives like ecopoints and ecocards. The cancellation or refusal of these documents can lead to significant operational disruptions, necessitating careful depositing and distribution protocols.",
