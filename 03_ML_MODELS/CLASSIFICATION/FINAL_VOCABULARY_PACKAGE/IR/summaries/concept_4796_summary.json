  "summary": "The \"frigid zone\" refers to regions characterized by extreme climatic conditions, often marked by steep slopes and high altitudes, where temperatures are unfavourable for agriculture. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is crucial for understanding the natural environment's impact on local communities (kommuner) and their inhabitants. The frigid zone often suffers from depopulation due to its infertile and marshy surfaces, which yield poor fodder and limit agricultural productivity. Regulatory measures recognize the unique challenges faced by these communes, including flooding and dwindling resources, necessitating tailored policies to support sustainable development and environmental management in these fragmented landscapes.",
