  "summary": "The concept of \"growth policy,\" redirected to \"development policy,\" encompasses a range of strategies aimed at fostering economic growth across EU regions, particularly in southern areas such as Apulia, Basilicata, and Calabria. This policy framework addresses challenges like poverty and corruption, employing various axes of intervention. It includes evaluations of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to ensure additionality and effectiveness. The policy outlines strategies indexed to inflation and focuses on interregional cooperation, inviting discussions on overlapping frameworks. The European Investment Bank (EIB) plays a crucial role in financing these initiatives, which are vital for sustainable development in regions like Sicily and Sardinia.",
