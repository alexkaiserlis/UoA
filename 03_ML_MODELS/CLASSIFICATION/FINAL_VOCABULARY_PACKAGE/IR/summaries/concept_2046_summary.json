  "summary": "Collective bargaining is a fundamental process in labour law and labour relations within the European Union, where employers and trade unions negotiate terms of employment. This process aims to establish collective agreements that govern wages, working conditions, and other employment-related matters. The EU recognizes the importance of collective bargaining as a means to promote social dialogue and ensure fair labour practices. It is often enshrined in national legislation and influenced by EU directives that seek to protect workers' rights and enhance social cohesion. Effective collective bargaining contributes to stable industrial relations and fosters a balanced approach to economic and social policies.",
