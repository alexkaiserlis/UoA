  "summary": "The concept of \"very long-term forecast,\" categorized under economic analysis, is redirected to the preferred term \"forward studies.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, forward studies are essential for anticipating economic trends and informing policy decisions. These forecasts extend beyond typical planning horizons, enabling the EU to prepare for significant socio-economic changes. By employing forward studies, EU institutions can enhance strategic planning, assess potential impacts of regulations, and align long-term objectives with current economic realities. This proactive approach is vital for ensuring sustainable development and effective governance within the EU.",
