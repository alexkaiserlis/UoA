  "summary": "The \"transfer of property\" within EU civil law encompasses the legal mechanisms by which ownership rights are conveyed from one party to another. This process is critical in contexts such as the annexation of territories like Crimea and Sevastopol, where issues of sovereignty and ownership are materially affected. The EU actively monitors such transfers to prevent destabilisation and ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks. Irregularities in property transfers can threaten the integrity of ownership rights, particularly in regions like Ukraine, where the freezing of assets and targeting of property can undermine independence. Leases and leasing agreements must also adhere to equitable principles, ensuring that owners are not disproportionately affected. The legal implications of transferring property, especially in conflict zones, require careful consideration to offset any potential threats to stability and security.",
