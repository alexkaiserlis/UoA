  "summary": "The concept \"Negara Brunei Darussalam,\" redirecting to the preferred term \"Brunei,\" pertains to the economic geography of this Southeast Asian nation. As a member of ASEAN, Brunei plays a significant role in regional trade agreements, impacting the import and export of goods such as chilled lobsters and molluscs. The EU's regulatory framework often intersects with Brunei's economic policies, particularly concerning sanitary standards for bivalve and gastropod products. Additionally, Brunei's strategic position alongside Malaysia and Indonesia enhances its economic belonging within the Andean and Caribbean contexts, influencing trade dynamics with municipalities in Togo, Guatemala, and beyond.",
