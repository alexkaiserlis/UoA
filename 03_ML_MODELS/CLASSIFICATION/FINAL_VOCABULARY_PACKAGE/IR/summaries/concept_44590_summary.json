  "summary": "In the context of EU energy policy, the term \"synthetic fuel\" is redirected to \"renewable fuel,\" which encompasses fuels produced from renewable energy sources through various processes. The European Union's legal framework aims to promote the development and utilization of renewable fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance energy security. Synthetic fuels are integral to achieving the EU's climate objectives, as they can be produced from carbon-neutral sources, thus contributing to the transition towards a sustainable energy system. This regulatory emphasis on renewable fuels reflects the EU's commitment to innovation and environmental stewardship in energy production.",
