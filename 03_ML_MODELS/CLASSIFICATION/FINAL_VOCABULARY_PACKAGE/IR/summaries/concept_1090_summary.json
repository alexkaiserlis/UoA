  "summary": "Franchising, within the EU legal and regulatory framework, refers to a distribution model where a franchisor grants a franchisee the rights to operate a business under its trademark and business system. This relationship is governed by specific regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and protecting intellectual property rights. The EU has established guidelines to regulate franchising agreements, emphasizing transparency, disclosure obligations, and the protection of franchisees against potential abuses. These regulations seek to harmonize practices across member states, fostering a balanced environment for both franchisors and franchisees, thereby enhancing the overall integrity of distributive trades within the internal market.",
