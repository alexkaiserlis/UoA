  "summary": "Mental illness, categorized under health in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, encompasses a range of psychological disorders that significantly impact an individual's cognitive, emotional, and social functioning. The EU recognizes the importance of addressing mental health issues through various directives and regulations aimed at promoting mental well-being and ensuring access to appropriate care. Legal instruments, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, emphasize the right to health and the necessity for member states to provide adequate support for individuals experiencing mental illness. This concept is crucial for the development of comprehensive health policies and the protection of vulnerable populations within the EU.",
