  "summary": "Naturalisation, as defined within the realm of international law, refers to the legal process by which a non-citizen acquires the nationality of a state, thereby gaining the rights and responsibilities associated with citizenship. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, naturalisation is governed by directives that ensure harmonisation of member states' laws, promoting the integration of third-country nationals. This process often involves criteria such as residency duration, language proficiency, and knowledge of the host country's culture. The term \"naturalization\" redirects to \"naturalisation,\" emphasizing the preferred British English spelling used in EU documents.",
