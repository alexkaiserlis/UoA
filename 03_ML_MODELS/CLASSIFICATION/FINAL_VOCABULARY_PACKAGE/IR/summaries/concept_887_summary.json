  "summary": "The \"Welfare State\" concept within the EU political framework refers to a system where the government plays a crucial role in ensuring social security and well-being for its citizens. This includes the provision of essential services such as healthcare, education, and unemployment benefits, aimed at reducing inequality and promoting social cohesion. EU legal and regulatory documents often address the Welfare State in the context of social rights, economic stability, and the protection of vulnerable populations. The concept underscores the balance between individual responsibility and state intervention, reflecting the EU's commitment to fostering a just and equitable society across member states.",
