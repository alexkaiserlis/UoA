  "summary": "The concept of \"appeal against non-compliance of the State,\" also referred to as \"action for failure to fulfil an obligation,\" pertains to legal proceedings initiated by the European Commission or member states when a state fails to meet its obligations under EU law. This action is crucial for ensuring compliance with EU regulations and directives, thereby upholding the rule of law within the Union. The procedure allows for judicial review by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), which can impose sanctions or compel compliance. This mechanism reinforces accountability and promotes uniform application of EU law across member states.",
