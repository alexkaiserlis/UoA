  "summary": "Geoengineering refers to deliberate interventions in the Earth's natural systems aimed at counteracting climate change and mitigating environmental deterioration. Within the EU legal and regulatory framework, geoengineering encompasses a range of techniques, including carbon capture and solar radiation management. The European Commission has initiated discussions on the governance of geoengineering practices, emphasizing the need for robust regulatory measures to assess potential ecological impacts and ethical considerations. As the EU seeks to balance innovation with environmental protection, geoengineering remains a contentious issue, necessitating comprehensive legal guidelines to ensure sustainable development and compliance with existing environmental legislation.",
