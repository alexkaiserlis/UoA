  "summary": "An \"outline agreement,\" redirected to the preferred term \"framework agreement,\" serves as a foundational legal instrument in EU international affairs. These agreements functionally bind parties to a set of principles, accommodating various disciplines, such as trade and cooperation. They are often employed in contexts like the IPARD and SAPARD programs, which support decentralised development in candidate countries. Framework agreements can also facilitate interregional cooperation, as seen in the MERCOSUR and EDA contexts. By embracing such agreements, the EU aims to broaden its influence, affording member states and partners the opportunity to engage in structured negotiations, ultimately enhancing stability in regions like the Balkans and Latin America.",
