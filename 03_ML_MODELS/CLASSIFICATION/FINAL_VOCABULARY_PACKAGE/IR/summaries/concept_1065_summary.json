  "summary": "The concept of \"high forest\" pertains to a forestry management system characterized by the cultivation of trees to achieve a mature, multi-layered canopy. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, high forests are significant for biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, and sustainable timber production. The EU's forestry policies advocate for practices that enhance ecological balance while promoting economic viability. High forests contribute to the objectives outlined in the EU Forest Strategy, which emphasizes sustainable forest management and the preservation of forest ecosystems. This concept is integral to achieving the EU's environmental goals and ensuring compliance with relevant directives.",
