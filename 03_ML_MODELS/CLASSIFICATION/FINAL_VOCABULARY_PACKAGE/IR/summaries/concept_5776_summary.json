  "summary": "The concept of \"Gulf Cooperation Council countries,\" commonly referred to as \"GCC countries,\" encompasses six Arab states: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. This grouping operates under a charter aimed at enhancing economic cooperation and external relations among its members. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the GCC's agreements and measures are significant for establishing common policies that exceed mere commercial interests, impacting spheres of trade and investment. The EU's engagement with these states often involves recommendations and opinions from its Parliament, facilitating necessary conclusions concerning economic and political cooperation.",
