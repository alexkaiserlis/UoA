  "summary": "Economic reconversion, also referred to as economic conversion, is a pivotal concept within EU economic policy frameworks aimed at stimulating transformation in regions facing unemployment and socio-economic challenges. This process often involves multiregional concertation among municipalities and provinces to accommodate the needs of inhabitants undergoing significant changes. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) plays a crucial role in financing these initiatives, ensuring additionality and indexation to address the severity of local conditions. By adopting innovative strategies and reinforcing interreg cooperation, the EU foresees a closer alignment of economic activities with the desire for sustainable growth, ultimately drawing on diverse perspectives to formulate effective solutions.",
