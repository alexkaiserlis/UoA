  "summary": "In EU legal and regulatory contexts, a \"parent company\" refers to a corporation that holds ownership over one or more subsidiaries. This structure can generate advantages, such as maximizing profits through strategic distributions and minimizing tax liabilities. However, mismatches in tax regulations may lead to unintended consequences, hampering corporate neutrality. Parent companies often face scrutiny for abusive practices, such as profit shifting or evasion, which can disadvantage taxpayers. To tackle these issues, EU regulations aim to eliminate misuse of tax exemptions and ensure that distributions, including dividends, are genuinely reflective of corporate realities. This governance is crucial for maintaining fairness in the corporate landscape.",
