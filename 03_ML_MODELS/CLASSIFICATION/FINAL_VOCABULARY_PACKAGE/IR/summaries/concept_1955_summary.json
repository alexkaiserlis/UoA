  "summary": "The \"economic model\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks serves as a systematic approach to analyze economic conditions and inform policy decisions. It encompasses ambitious reforms aimed at stabilizing economies, such as those in Belarus, where external debt and financial constraints necessitate a managed transformation. The model often involves negotiations with institutions like the IMF, focusing on timely arrangements for loan instalments and restructuring efforts. It supports a partnership between donors and recipient countries, ensuring that economic service delivery remains effective. By understanding these dynamics, the EU can facilitate a residual economic gap closure, fostering a sustainable economic environment through strategic political and monetary efforts.",
