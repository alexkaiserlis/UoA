  "summary": "The concept of \"urban search and rescue,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"search and rescue,\" pertains to the coordinated efforts undertaken in emergency situations, particularly in urban environments, to locate and assist individuals trapped or in distress. Within the framework of EU cooperation policy, this concept is crucial for enhancing cross-border collaboration among member states during disasters. The EU's regulatory framework promotes the establishment of protocols, resource sharing, and training initiatives to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of search and rescue operations. By fostering cooperation, the EU aims to ensure rapid response and support for affected populations in urban crises.",
