  "summary": "Atheism, categorized under culture and religion, represents a worldview characterized by the absence of belief in deities. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, atheism intersects with fundamental rights, particularly concerning freedom of thought, conscience, and religion as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This principle ensures that individuals, regardless of their belief systems, including atheistic perspectives, are afforded equal protection under the law. The EU promotes tolerance and respect for diverse beliefs, fostering an inclusive environment that acknowledges atheism as a legitimate stance within the broader discourse on human rights and cultural diversity.",
