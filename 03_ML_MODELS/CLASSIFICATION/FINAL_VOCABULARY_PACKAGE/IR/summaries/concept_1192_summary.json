  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the term \"pressure group\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"interest group.\" Interest groups are organized entities that seek to influence public policy and decision-making processes at various levels, including EU institutions. These groups often represent specific interests, such as environmental protection, business sectors, or social causes, and engage in advocacy to promote their agendas. Their activities can include lobbying, public campaigns, and participation in consultations, thereby playing a crucial role in shaping legislation and regulatory measures. Understanding the dynamics of interest groups is essential for comprehending the broader political landscape within the EU.",
