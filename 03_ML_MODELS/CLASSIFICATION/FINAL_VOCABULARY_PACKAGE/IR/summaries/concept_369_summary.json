  "summary": "Deflationary policy, often redirected to the preferred term \"deflation,\" refers to a set of economic measures aimed at reducing inflation rates within the European Union. This policy typically involves tightening monetary supply and increasing interest rates to curb excessive spending and stabilize prices. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, deflationary policies are crucial for maintaining economic stability and ensuring compliance with the Maastricht criteria, which govern fiscal discipline among member states. Such measures can impact public investment and consumer confidence, necessitating careful consideration by policymakers to balance economic growth with price stability.",
