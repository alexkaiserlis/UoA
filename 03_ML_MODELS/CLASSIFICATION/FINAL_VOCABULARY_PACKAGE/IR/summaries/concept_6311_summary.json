  "summary": "Land policies within the context of EU agricultural policy encompass a range of regulatory frameworks aimed at managing land use, promoting sustainable agriculture, and ensuring food security. These policies are integral to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which seeks to balance agricultural productivity with environmental stewardship. By establishing guidelines for land management, the EU aims to address issues such as land degradation, biodiversity loss, and climate change. Furthermore, land policies facilitate rural development and support farmers in adapting to market demands and environmental challenges. Overall, these regulations are crucial for fostering a resilient agricultural sector within the EU.",
