  "summary": "The \"return of cultural objects\" pertains to the legal and regulatory framework within the EU aimed at ensuring the repatriation of unlawfully removed treasures, such as paintings, drawings, and other artistic specimens. This concept is closely linked to the preferred term \"cultural object,\" which encompasses various forms of artistic expression, including gouache and pastel works. The EU's commitment to preserving cultural heritage is reflected in its compliance with UNESCO conventions, which advocate for the return of objects that have been irrevocably deprived from their rightful owners. Legal mechanisms facilitate the return process, ensuring that objects are uniformly restored to their original context, thereby complementing cultural traditions and enhancing public exhibitions across Europe.",
