  "summary": "The \"Galapagos Islands,\" categorized under political geography, are significant in the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning biodiversity and environmental protection. These islands, located in the Pacific Ocean, are renowned for their unique ecosystems, which are often referenced in EU discussions on conservation policies and international agreements. The EU's commitment to sustainable development and ecological preservation may influence its stance on external territories like the Galapagos, especially regarding compliance with international environmental standards. Thus, while not directly governed by EU law, the islands serve as a pertinent example in the discourse on global environmental governance.",
