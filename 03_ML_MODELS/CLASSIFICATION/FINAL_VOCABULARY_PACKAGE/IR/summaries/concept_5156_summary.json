  "summary": "The concept of \"capital market\" within the EU legal framework pertains to the free movement of capital, crucial for fostering economic integration. It encompasses various financial institutions and instruments that facilitate investment, including unquoted securities and distressed assets. The regulatory landscape aims to prevent manipulative behaviours and ensure transparency, particularly in hyperinflationary environments. Institutions involved, such as jugobanka and beogradska, must adhere to strict guidelines to unfreeze assets and reclassify distressed investments. The EU's approach also addresses intragroup transactions and the need for restatement of financial statements under IFRS. Ultimately, the capital market serves as a venue for adopters seeking to navigate complex financial landscapes.",
