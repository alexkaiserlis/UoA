  "summary": "Supplementary financing in the EU context refers to additional funding mechanisms mobilised to support projects that may not fully meet standard budgetary constraints. This financing can consist of various sources, including international investments and dedicated funds aimed at enhancing interoperability among member states. For instance, the Estonian and Maltese governments may raise supplementary financing to address specific barriers in their economic profiles. Such financing is crucial for projects involving traceability in sectors like agriculture, where pests like the nematode bursaphelenchus can impact crop yield. By validating invoices and controlling budgets, EU entities can effectively audit and manage these supplementary funds, ensuring they cater to the needs of diverse stakeholders across the region.",
