  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, a \"skilled worker\" is defined as an individual who possesses specific training and education, often at a tertiary level, enabling them to fill positions that require advanced competencies. The EU emphasizes the importance of a responsive and adaptable workforce to combat unemployment and poverty, reflecting the need for lifelong learning and skills updating. Policies aim to create a stable and inclusive labour market, focusing on reforms that enhance productivity and cohesion. The interdependence of member states necessitates coordinated efforts to define precise targets and guide educational initiatives, ensuring that skilled workers play a pivotal role in achieving shared economic objectives.",
