  "summary": "The concept of \"foreign market\" within EU trade policy encompasses the responsibility of member states and organizations to expand their sales and promotional activities beyond domestic borders. This involves altering existing contracts to meet the qualifications of foreign markets, thereby avoiding clashes with local regulations. Agencies are invited to gather facts and prepare reasoned forecasts regarding market conditions. The expansion into foreign markets is often deferred due to regulatory complexities, necessitating formal publishing of guidelines. The EU stipulates that promotional efforts must be properly aligned with earlier established standards, ensuring that entities are liable for compliance while pursuing new opportunities in international trade.",
