  "summary": "The \"transport market\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses various services and obligations related to air navigation and aviation safety. It establishes compliance with international standards set by organisations such as ICAO. Recent directives and amendments, including updated provisions and annexes, aim to enhance the efficiency of transport services across the European Economic Area (EEA). The relevant regulations, often contained in recitals, provide a framework for the transposition of laws that govern the operation of transport markets. These updates ensure that the EU's transport policy remains aligned with international conventions, thereby reinforcing the relevance of safety and service standards in this dynamic field.",
