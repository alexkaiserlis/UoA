  "summary": "The concept of \"sustainable transport,\" redirected to \"sustainable mobility,\" encompasses the EU's commitment to developing clean, intermodal transport systems that promote optimal connectivity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This regulatory framework aims to address backwardness in transport infrastructure by fostering synergies between urban and transnational networks. The pursuit of sustainable mobility involves interventions that enhance interoperability and complementarity among various transport modes, including rail and river transport. By aligning financial resources, such as the ERDF, with thematic goals, the EU seeks to accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources, thereby reducing traffic-related pollution and addressing territorial disparities. Indicators of success will include aggregated data on emissions reduction and the simultaneous generation of inclusive housing and heating solutions.",
