  "summary": "The term \"combat helicopter\" refers to a specialized military aircraft designed for engaging in combat operations. Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, combat helicopters are subject to stringent regulations governing their development, procurement, and deployment. The European Union's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) emphasizes the need for interoperability and standardization among member states' armed forces, which includes the integration of advanced combat helicopter capabilities. Additionally, EU regulations on arms exports and military technology transfer ensure compliance with international law and promote responsible defense practices among member states, thereby enhancing collective security and operational effectiveness.",
