  "summary": "Crustacean farming, classified under the fisheries category, pertains to the aquaculture practices focused on the cultivation of crustaceans, such as shrimp and crabs, within controlled environments. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept is governed by various directives aimed at ensuring sustainable practices, environmental protection, and food safety standards. The European Union emphasizes the importance of responsible crustacean farming to mitigate overfishing and preserve marine biodiversity. Regulations also address the welfare of farmed species and the traceability of products, thereby enhancing consumer confidence and promoting a competitive aquaculture sector within the EU market.",
