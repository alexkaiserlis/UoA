  "summary": "The term \"semi-skilled worker\" refers to individuals in the labour market who possess a specific set of skills that are not fully professional but exceed basic qualifications. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, semi-skilled workers play a crucial role in various sectors, contributing to economic growth and addressing skill shortages. The EU's policies on migration and employment often include provisions for the integration of semi-skilled workers, recognizing their importance in maintaining a balanced labour market. Regulations may facilitate their mobility across member states, ensuring that their rights and working conditions are protected under EU law.",
