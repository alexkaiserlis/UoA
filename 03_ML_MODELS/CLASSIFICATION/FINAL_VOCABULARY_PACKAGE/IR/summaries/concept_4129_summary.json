  "summary": "The concept of \"island region\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks refers to areas characterized by insularity, often comprising archipelagos and remoter terrains. These regions face unique challenges, including economic backwardness and vulnerability due to their geographical isolation. The EU recognizes that such regions deserve tailored policies that cater to their specific needs, addressing deficiencies in infrastructure and services. Regulatory measures are designed to ease the handicaps posed by their remoteness, rationalising support for sectors like fisheries, where demersal species such as seabream and swordfish are prevalent. Consequently, the compartmentalization of policies for island regions is crucial for fostering sustainable development and overcoming overwhelming drawbacks associated with their fragile environments.",
