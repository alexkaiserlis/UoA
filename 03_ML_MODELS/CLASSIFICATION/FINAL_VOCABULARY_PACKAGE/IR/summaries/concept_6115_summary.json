  "summary": "The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is a pivotal instrument within the framework of international trade, specifically addressing the liberalization of services. As a key component of the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, GATS establishes a multilateral regime that governs the trade of services among member states, including those in the European Union. The EU actively engages with GATS to enhance market access and ensure fair competition in the services sector. This agreement facilitates the integration of services into global trade, promoting economic growth while adhering to regulatory standards and commitments. GATS is thus essential for the EU's trade policy and international relations.",
