  "summary": "The concept of \"social status\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to the recognition and categorization of individuals based on various socio-economic factors. It encompasses aspects such as employment, education, and social welfare, which are critical for the formulation of policies aimed at promoting social inclusion and equality. The EU's commitment to enhancing social cohesion is reflected in directives and regulations that address discrimination based on social status. This concept is integral to understanding the broader social framework, as it influences legislative measures designed to protect vulnerable groups and ensure equitable access to resources and opportunities across member states.",
