  "summary": "Hydroelectric development refers to the process of harnessing water flow to generate electricity, a critical component of the EU's renewable energy strategy. This concept is governed by various EU legal and regulatory frameworks aimed at promoting sustainable energy production while ensuring environmental protection. The EU's Renewable Energy Directive encourages member states to invest in hydroelectric projects, balancing energy needs with ecological considerations. Compliance with the Water Framework Directive is essential to mitigate potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Overall, hydroelectric development plays a vital role in the EU's transition towards a low-carbon economy, fostering energy security and sustainability.",
