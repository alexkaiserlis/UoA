  "summary": "The \"ballot paper\" is a crucial element in the electoral procedure and voting framework within the European Union. It serves as the official document that enables voters to express their preferences during elections, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the voting process. The design and regulation of ballot papers are governed by EU electoral directives, which stipulate standards to prevent fraud and ensure accessibility. Compliance with these regulations is essential for maintaining democratic legitimacy across member states. The ballot paper thus embodies the principles of transparency and accountability, fundamental to the EU's commitment to democratic governance.",
