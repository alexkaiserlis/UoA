  "summary": "\"Joint competence\" refers to the shared authority of the European Union (EU) and its Member States to legislate and regulate in specific areas. This concept is crucial in delineating the scope of EU law, where both levels of governance can enact legislation, thereby fostering cooperation and ensuring coherent policy implementation. Joint competence is particularly significant in areas such as environmental protection, consumer protection, and internal market regulations. It allows for a harmonized approach while respecting the autonomy of Member States, ensuring that both EU institutions and national governments can contribute to legislative processes effectively.",
