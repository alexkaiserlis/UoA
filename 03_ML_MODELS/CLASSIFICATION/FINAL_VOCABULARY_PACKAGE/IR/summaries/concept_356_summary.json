  "summary": "The concept of \"explanation of voting\" pertains to the procedural aspects of parliamentary proceedings within the European Union. It encompasses the mechanisms through which Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) articulate their voting intentions and the rationale behind their choices during legislative sessions. This explanation is crucial for transparency and accountability, allowing constituents to understand the decision-making processes that shape EU legislation. By providing clarity on voting practices, the concept facilitates informed public discourse and enhances the democratic legitimacy of the EU's institutional framework. Thus, it plays a vital role in fostering engagement and trust in EU governance.",
