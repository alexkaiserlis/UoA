  "summary": "Social dialogue in the EU context represents a tripartite mechanism involving employers, employees, and governmental bodies, aimed at fostering concertation on various labour law topics. This dialogue is crucial for enhancing employability and adaptability within the workforce, addressing macroeconomic pressures, and formalising agreements that promote representativeness among confederations like ETUC and UNICE. It serves as a platform for anticipatory discussions, allowing stakeholders to address potential redundancies and skill mismatches. The legitimacy of social dialogue is reinforced through summits, such as those held in Laeken and Cologne, where diverse societal interests converge, ensuring a supportive environment for constructive negotiations and synergy among parties.",
