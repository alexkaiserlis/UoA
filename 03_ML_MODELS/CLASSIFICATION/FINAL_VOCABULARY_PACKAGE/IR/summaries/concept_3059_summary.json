  "summary": "The concept of \"vote by delegation\" refers to a procedural mechanism within EU parliamentary proceedings that allows a Member of Parliament (MEP) to authorize another MEP to cast a vote on their behalf. This practice is significant in ensuring representation and participation in legislative activities, particularly when an MEP is unable to attend a session. The delegation of voting rights is governed by specific rules outlined in the European Parliament's regulations, which aim to maintain the integrity of democratic processes while accommodating the logistical challenges faced by parliamentarians. This mechanism underscores the importance of collective decision-making in the EU legislative framework.",
