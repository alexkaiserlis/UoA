  "summary": "Territorial cohesion is a fundamental principle within the European Union's legal framework, aimed at reducing disparities between regions and promoting balanced development. It emphasizes the importance of integrating economic, social, and environmental policies to ensure that all regions, particularly less developed areas, benefit from EU initiatives. This concept is enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and guides various regulatory measures, including cohesion policy and funding mechanisms. By fostering territorial cohesion, the EU seeks to enhance solidarity among member states, ensuring that all citizens have equitable access to opportunities and resources, thereby reinforcing the overall unity of the Union.",
