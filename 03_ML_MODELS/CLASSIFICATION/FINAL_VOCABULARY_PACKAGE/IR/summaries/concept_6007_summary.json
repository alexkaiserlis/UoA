  "summary": "The \"safeguard clause,\" also referred to as a \"protective clause,\" is a crucial mechanism in EU legal frameworks, designed to address unforeseen eventualities that may destabilise agreements. It empowers parties to take necessary actions, ensuring that obligations are not unrealized due to unforeseen circumstances. By allowing for temporary relaxations of commitments, it profoundly impacts the regulatory landscape, particularly in international affairs. This clause can be invoked when conditions deteriorate, evidencing the need for protective measures. Its application can be seen in various contexts, from trade agreements to environmental regulations, where the potential for adverse effects necessitates a proactive approach to mitigate risks and redress imbalances.",
