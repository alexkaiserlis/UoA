  "summary": "Forestry regulations, often referred to as forestry legislation, encompass a range of legal frameworks governing the management and conservation of forests within the EU. These regulations aim to combat illegal logging and ensure sustainable timber production through rigorous licensing and enforcement mechanisms. They facilitate partnerships with countries like Indonesia and the Congo, promoting FLEGT (Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade) initiatives. Key aspects include the registration of timber purchasers, the certification of sustainable practices, and the monitoring of supply chains to address illegal activities. By establishing standards for logging and forest interventions, these regulations support the responsible management of forest resources, ensuring that patterns of exploitation are effectively disrupted and that forest ecosystems are preserved for future generations.",
