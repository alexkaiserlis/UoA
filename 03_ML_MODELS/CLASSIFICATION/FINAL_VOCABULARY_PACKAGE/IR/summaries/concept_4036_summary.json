  "summary": "The concept of \"product safety\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks encompasses the protection of consumers from hazardous goods. It mandates that products, including those containing methylenediphenyl diisocyanate and diisopentylphthalate, must not exhibit toxicities that could harm users. The regulation requires manufacturers to provide clear information about product interiors and potential risks, such as those associated with hexahydrocoumarin in cosmetics or methylchloroisothiazolinone in toiletries. Compliance involves rigorous testing and guarding against unsafe practices, ensuring that products do not intermittently pose risks. The EU's approach reflects a revolution in consumer protection, emphasizing deference to safety standards and the importance of responsible manufacturing practices.",
