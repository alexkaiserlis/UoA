  "summary": "The \"post-Cold War world\" refers to the geopolitical landscape following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, characterized by a shift in international security dynamics. In EU legal and regulatory contexts, this term is pivotal as it encompasses the evolution of collective security frameworks, the emergence of new threats, and the redefinition of defense policies. The EU has adapted its regulatory mechanisms to address challenges such as terrorism, cyber threats, and regional conflicts that arose in this era. As a redirect to the preferred term \"post-Cold War,\" it underscores the importance of understanding historical context in shaping contemporary EU security strategies and legal instruments.",
