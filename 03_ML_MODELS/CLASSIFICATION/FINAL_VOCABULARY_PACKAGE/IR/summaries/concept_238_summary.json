  "summary": "Corporatism, within the framework of EU labour law and labour relations, refers to a political and economic system where various interest groups, particularly employers and trade unions, collaborate with the state to shape policies and regulations. This model emphasizes the importance of collective bargaining and social dialogue, fostering a cooperative relationship between the state and organized interests. In the EU context, corporatism is significant in shaping labour market regulations, influencing social policy, and ensuring that diverse stakeholder perspectives are integrated into decision-making processes. This approach aims to balance economic efficiency with social equity, promoting stability in labour relations across member states.",
