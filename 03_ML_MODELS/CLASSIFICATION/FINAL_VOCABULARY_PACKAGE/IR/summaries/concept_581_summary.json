  "summary": "Territoriality, often redirected to \"territorial law,\" is a fundamental principle in international law, particularly relevant in EU legal frameworks. It underscores the jurisdictional boundaries that dictate how laws apply within specific geographical areas. In the context of geopolitical tensions, such as the annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in Donbass, territoriality becomes crucial in addressing issues of sovereignty and the legality of actions that threaten unity. The EU's regulatory responses often involve affirming boundaries and condemning destabilisation efforts that obstruct transfrontier cooperation. Legal frameworks must navigate these complexities, ensuring that laws are not materially undermined by separatist movements or unprovoked aggression, while also benefitting from enhanced cooperation across roads, highways, and bridges that link member states.",
