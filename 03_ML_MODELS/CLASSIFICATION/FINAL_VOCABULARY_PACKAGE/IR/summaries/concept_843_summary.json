  "summary": "\"Budgetary equilibrium\" refers to the principle of maintaining a balanced budget within the EU's public finance and budget policy framework. This concept hinges on the commitment of member states to avoid excessive deficits, as outlined in the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). The EU has adopted measures to targetting vulnerabilities that could lead to fiscal slippage, including protracted retrenchment and recapitalisation strategies. As economic conditions fluctuate, the need for budgetary equilibrium becomes more pressing, with looming hikes in public expenditure potentially impacting fiscal stability. The Council has alerted member states to the importance of adhering to these principles to prevent stagnation and ensure sustainable growth, thereby avoiding a deadlock in financial governance.",
