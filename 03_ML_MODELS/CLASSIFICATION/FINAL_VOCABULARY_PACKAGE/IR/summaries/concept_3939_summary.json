  "summary": "The concept of \"enjoyment of rights\" within EU civil law pertains to the fundamental principle that individuals should be able to fully exercise and benefit from their legal entitlements. This encompasses various rights, including civil, political, and social rights, ensuring that all EU citizens can engage in activities without undue interference. The enjoyment of rights is crucial for upholding the rule of law and promoting equality within the EU framework.
