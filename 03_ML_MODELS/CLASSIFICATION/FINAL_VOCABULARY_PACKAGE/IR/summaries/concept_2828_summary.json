  "summary": "The \"right to privacy,\" often referred to as the \"protection of privacy,\" encompasses the fundamental legal frameworks that govern the collection, processing, and storage of personal data within the EU. This concept is particularly enshrined in various legal instruments, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which provides warranties for individuals against arbitrary data collection by controllers. In a federally structured context, such as in cantonal systems, the enjoyment of privacy rights must be particularised to align with local legislations. The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and other regulatory bodies, like EASO and Frontex, instruct on the transborder implications of data protection, ensuring that personal data collections are factually justified and do not contradict the principles of non-discrimination, including against racism and xenophobia. The EU's commitment to privacy is further reflected in its legislative orientations and the establishment of registries that uphold these rights across member states, thereby fostering an amicable balance between privacy and public interest.",
