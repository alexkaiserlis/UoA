  "summary": "The concept of \"substitute energy,\" a redirect to \"soft energy,\" encompasses alternative energy sources aimed at reducing reliance on hydrocarbons. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, this concept supports the multiannual strategy for energy saving and exploitation of renewable resources. The European Commission has indicated a willingness to grant financial support for projects that demonstrate effective substitution and contribute to the future energy landscape. Regulations and proposals amending existing treaties aim to establish necessary conditions for implementation, ensuring that communities can avoid energy interruption. The Council and Parliament play crucial roles in the development of this social and economic framework.",
