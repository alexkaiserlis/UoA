  "summary": "The term \"supreme court of appeal\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"higher court,\" which denotes a pivotal institution within the organization of the legal system in the EU. Higher courts serve as the final arbiters in legal disputes, ensuring the uniform application of law across member states. They play a crucial role in interpreting EU legislation and safeguarding fundamental rights. By reviewing decisions made by lower courts, higher courts contribute to the coherence of legal principles, thereby enhancing judicial efficiency and promoting legal certainty. Their authority is essential for upholding the rule of law within the EU framework.",
