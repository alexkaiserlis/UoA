  "summary": "The concept of \"social reform,\" redirected to \"social change,\" encompasses the fundamental transformations in societal structures that aim to enhance human rights and freedoms across Europe. Within EU legal and regulatory frameworks, social change is vital for establishing partnerships that support independent republics, such as Slovenia and Slovakia, in their transition towards democratic governance. This process often involves adopting reforms that justify the continuation of humanitarian efforts, particularly in regions like Bosnia and Herzegovina, and addressing violations of rights. The EU's role extends to qualifying beneficiary states, ensuring that reforms fulfill the criteria for integration into the broader Mediterranean and Central European contexts.",
