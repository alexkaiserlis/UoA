  "summary": "The term \"civil service\" refers to the body of government employees who are appointed to serve the public interest, distinct from political appointees. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, civil service encompasses the principles of meritocracy, neutrality, and accountability, ensuring that public administration operates effectively and efficiently. The EU promotes a robust civil service to uphold democratic values and the rule of law across member states. Regulations governing civil service aim to standardize recruitment, training, and conduct, fostering a professional workforce dedicated to implementing EU policies and delivering public services in a transparent manner.",
