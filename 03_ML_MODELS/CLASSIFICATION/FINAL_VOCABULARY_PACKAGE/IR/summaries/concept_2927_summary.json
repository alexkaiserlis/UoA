  "summary": "The \"recommendation of the European Central Bank\" refers to a non-binding instrument issued by the ECB, aimed at guiding Member States or institutions in the implementation of EU monetary policy. As a form of soft law, this recommendation (EU) serves to influence actions without imposing legal obligations. It is pivotal in the regulatory framework, allowing the ECB to articulate its views and expectations regarding economic governance. While not enforceable, such recommendations can shape national policies and foster compliance with broader EU objectives, thus playing a crucial role in the harmonization of economic practices across the Union.",
