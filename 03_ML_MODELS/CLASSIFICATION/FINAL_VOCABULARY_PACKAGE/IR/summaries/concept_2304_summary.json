  "summary": "Inshore fishing refers to the practice of fishing within coastal waters, typically extending up to 12 nautical miles from the shore. This sector is indispensable for the livelihood of many fishermen in EU member states, particularly in regions like the Canary Islands and along the coasts of Senegal and Guinea. The EU adopts regulations to ensure equitable access to these waters, balancing conservation efforts with the economic needs of local communities. Modernizing fishing practices, such as the use of trawls and beam techniques, is essential for sustainable management. The realization of these goals often involves restructuring subsidies and appropriations to support inshore fisheries, while also addressing the disadvantages faced by smaller operators. The jurisdiction over these waters is critical, as it impacts the sovereignty of coastal states and their ability to manage resources effectively.",
