  "summary": "Seasonal migration refers to the temporary movement of individuals, often for work purposes, between countries, particularly within the European Union. This phenomenon is regulated under various EU legal frameworks, which aim to facilitate labor mobility while ensuring the protection of migrant rights. Seasonal migration is particularly relevant in sectors such as agriculture and tourism, where labor demand fluctuates throughout the year. The EU has established directives to govern the conditions under which seasonal migrants can enter and reside in member states, emphasizing compliance with labor standards and social protections. This regulatory approach seeks to balance economic needs with humanitarian considerations.",
