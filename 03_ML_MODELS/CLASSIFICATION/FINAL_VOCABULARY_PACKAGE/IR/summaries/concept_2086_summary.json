  "summary": "The concept of \"apartheid\" within the EU legal framework refers to a systematic regime of institutionalized racial discrimination and oppression, primarily associated with South Africa's historical context. In EU regulatory documents, apartheid is addressed under human rights and freedoms, emphasizing the Union's commitment to promoting equality and non-discrimination. The EU condemns apartheid as a violation of fundamental rights, aligning its policies with international human rights standards. This concept is crucial for understanding the EU's stance on global human rights issues and its legislative efforts to combat all forms of discrimination, thereby reinforcing its foundational principles of dignity and respect for all individuals.",
