  "summary": "A \"works council\" is a consultative body established within organizations, primarily in the context of EU labour law and labour relations. It is composed of representatives, often appointed from among the workers, who are designated to engage with employers on various issues, including vocational training and workplace conditions. The creation of works councils involves a process where nominees are drawn from lists of candidates, ensuring representation across sectors such as coal and steel. These councils play a crucial role in coordinating tasks and improving living standards for workers, with their mandates expiring periodically, necessitating notifications for renewal and the appointment of alternates.",
