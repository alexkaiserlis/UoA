  "summary": "The term \"radical party\" refers to a political party that advocates for significant, often fundamental changes in the political system or societal structure. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, radical parties may influence policy-making and democratic processes, particularly in relation to issues such as governance, civil rights, and social justice. These parties often emerge in response to perceived inadequacies within traditional political systems, seeking to address grievances through radical reform. Their presence in the European political landscape raises important questions regarding representation, electoral integrity, and the balance of power within the EU's democratic institutions.",
