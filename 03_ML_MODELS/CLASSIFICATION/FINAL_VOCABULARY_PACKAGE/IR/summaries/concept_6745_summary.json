In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, the concept highlights the challenges faced in achieving equitable labour market participation and social inclusion. The European Union has implemented various directives aimed at improving working conditions and ensuring fair remuneration, thereby addressing the plight of the working poor. This demographic underscores the need for policies that promote decent work, enhance social protection, and combat poverty, aligning with the EU's broader objectives of fostering economic growth and social cohesion.",
