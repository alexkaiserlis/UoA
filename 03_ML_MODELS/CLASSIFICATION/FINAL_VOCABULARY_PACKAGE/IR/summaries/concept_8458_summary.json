  "summary": "The concept of \"recusation of a judge,\" also referred to as \"challenge,\" pertains to the legal mechanism by which a party in a judicial proceeding seeks to disqualify a judge from a case due to potential bias or conflict of interest. In the context of EU law, this process is crucial for ensuring the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary, thereby upholding the principles of justice. The challenge may arise from various grounds, including personal connections or prior involvement in related matters. Properly addressing recusation is essential for maintaining public confidence in the legal system and ensuring fair trial rights.",
