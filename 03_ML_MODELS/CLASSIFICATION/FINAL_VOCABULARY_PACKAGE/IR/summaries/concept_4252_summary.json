  "summary": "An interprofessional agreement is a binding contract established between recognized organisations within a specific branch, such as agriculture or aquaculture, to harmonize practices and standards. These agreements outline mechanisms for cooperation, facilitating efficient communication among producers and operators. They may include provisions for the fixation of prices, regular checks on conformity, and the withdrawal of non-compliant products from markets. By specifying responsibilities and triggering notifications, these agreements aim to enhance the supervision of production processes, ensuring that delivered goods meet quality standards. The publication of such agreements serves to inform stakeholders and promote transparency in the respective territories.",
