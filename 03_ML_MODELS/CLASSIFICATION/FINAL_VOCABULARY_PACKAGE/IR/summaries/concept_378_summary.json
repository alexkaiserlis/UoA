  "summary": "The concept of \"energy requirements,\" categorized under EU energy policy, is redirected to the preferred term \"energy demand.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, energy demand encompasses the total quantity of energy that consumers require to meet their needs. This concept is pivotal for formulating policies aimed at enhancing energy efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and ensuring sustainable energy supply. Regulatory measures often focus on assessing energy demand to inform strategic planning and investment in renewable energy sources, thereby aligning with the EU's broader objectives of energy security and environmental sustainability.",
