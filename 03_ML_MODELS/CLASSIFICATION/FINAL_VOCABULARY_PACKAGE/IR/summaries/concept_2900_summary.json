  "summary": "The \"uniform basis of assessment,\" also referred to as the \"basis of tax assessment,\" is a critical concept in EU taxation law, ensuring equitable treatment of taxpayers across member states. This framework combats disparate tax practices by establishing standardized criteria for calculating taxes on movable and immovable properties, including vehicles and tolls. It addresses issues of territoriality and equalisation, allowing for accurate estimatates of tax liabilities. By harmonising regulations, it facilitates the transferor's obligations and the lessee's rights, while also providing clarity for notaries and bailiffs involved in tax collection. The concept is vital for maintaining the integrity of tax systems, preventing tampering and ensuring compliance among proprietors and subcontractors alike.",
