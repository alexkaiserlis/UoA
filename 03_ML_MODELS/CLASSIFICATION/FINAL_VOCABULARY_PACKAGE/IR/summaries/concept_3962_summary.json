  "summary": "The \"prison system\" within the context of EU criminal law encompasses the regulatory framework governing the administration and operation of correctional facilities across member states. This system aims to ensure the humane treatment of incarcerated individuals, uphold their rights, and facilitate rehabilitation. The EU promotes harmonization of prison standards through directives and recommendations, addressing issues such as overcrowding, mental health care, and reintegration into society. Furthermore, the prison system is integral to the broader criminal justice framework, which seeks to balance public safety with the principles of proportionality and respect for human dignity in the enforcement of law.",
