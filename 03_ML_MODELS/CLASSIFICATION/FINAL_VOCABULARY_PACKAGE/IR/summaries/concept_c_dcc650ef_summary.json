  "summary": "The term \"alternative investment fund manager\" (AIFM) refers to entities that manage alternative investment funds (AIFs) within the European Union. AIFMs are subject to the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), which establishes a regulatory framework aimed at enhancing transparency and investor protection in the management of AIFs. This directive mandates AIFMs to adhere to specific requirements regarding risk management, disclosure, and reporting obligations. As a redirect to the preferred term \"alternative investment,\" the concept underscores the growing significance of non-traditional investment vehicles in the EU financial landscape, emphasizing the need for robust regulatory oversight in this sector.",
