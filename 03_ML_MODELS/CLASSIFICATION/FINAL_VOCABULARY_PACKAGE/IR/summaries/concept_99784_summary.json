  "summary": "Illiberalism, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to political practices that undermine democratic principles, such as the rule of law, separation of powers, and fundamental rights. This concept often manifests in the erosion of civil liberties and the suppression of dissent, challenging the foundational values enshrined in EU treaties. As the EU seeks to promote democratic governance, illiberalism poses significant regulatory challenges, prompting the need for robust mechanisms to safeguard democracy and uphold human rights across member states. Addressing illiberalism is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the EU's political framework and ensuring compliance with its legal standards.",
