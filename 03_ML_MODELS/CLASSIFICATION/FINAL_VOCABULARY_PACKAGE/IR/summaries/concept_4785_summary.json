  "summary": "The concept of \"arid zone\" pertains to regions characterized by low precipitation, often leading to desertification and drought. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these areas are governed by initiatives aimed at combating climate change and promoting sustainable development. The EU actively participates in global partnerships to tackle the complex issues of poverty and biological conservation in disadvantaged regions, particularly in Africa and the Mediterranean. Through the ratification of agreements like the Paris Accord, the EU affirms its commitment to mitigate the effects of climate change and encourages cooperation among member states to address these pressing problems, contributing to the achievement of environmental sustainability.",
