  "summary": "In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, \"payload\" refers to the cargo or goods transported by various modes of transport, which is essential for the organisation of transport. The term is significant in regulations governing transport logistics, safety standards, and environmental impact assessments. Understanding payload specifications is crucial for compliance with EU directives that aim to enhance efficiency and sustainability in transport operations. Additionally, payload considerations influence the development of transport infrastructure and the implementation of policies designed to facilitate seamless movement across member states, thereby supporting the internal market and promoting economic cohesion within the EU.",
