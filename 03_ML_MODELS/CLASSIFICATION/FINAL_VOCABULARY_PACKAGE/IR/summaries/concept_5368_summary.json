  "summary": "A \"movement certificate\" is a crucial document in the context of EU tariff policy, facilitating the movement of goods across borders, particularly in relation to excisable products. It serves as proof of compliance with regulatory requirements, ensuring that commercial transactions are conducted without retrograde complications. In the context of accession, it anticipatively addresses potential inconveniences that may arise during intersessional trade negotiations. The certificate is essential for landlocked countries, providing access to markets while mitigating the risk of forfeiture. By ensuring parallelism in documentation, it aids in the smooth operation of trade, particularly for goods like carpets and yarns, while addressing issues such as diabetes and epilepsy through regulated access to medical supplies. The movement certificate thus plays a pivotal role in the EU's regulatory framework, ensuring that all parties adhere to established standards, thereby enhancing community trust and cooperation.",
