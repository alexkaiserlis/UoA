  "summary": "In the context of EU finance, a \"net recipient\" refers to a member state that receives more funds from the EU budget than it contributes. This concept is pivotal in discussions surrounding the distribution of financial resources within the EU, particularly in relation to cohesion policy and regional development. Net recipients often benefit from various funding mechanisms aimed at reducing disparities among member states. The classification of a state as a net recipient can influence negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and impact the allocation of resources for projects aimed at fostering economic growth and social cohesion across the Union.",
