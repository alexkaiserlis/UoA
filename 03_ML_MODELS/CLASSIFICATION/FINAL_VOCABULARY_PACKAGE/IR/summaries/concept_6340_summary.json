  "summary": "A \"stability programme\" in the EU context refers to a strategic framework adopted by member states to ensure fiscal discipline and adherence to budgetary targets. These programmes are crucial for addressing potential slippages in public finance, particularly during periods of economic downturn or stagnation. They aim to mitigate misalignments with the Medium-Term Objective (MTO) and enhance fiscal fundamentals. The Council-adopted stability programmes are underpinned by commitments to conditionality, ensuring that member states enact necessary reforms. In times of economic upswing, these programmes may also facilitate recapitalisation efforts, while addressing shortfalls and avoiding deadlock in financial markets. The projections within these programmes are vital for maintaining investor confidence and securing ample funding through mechanisms like the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).",
