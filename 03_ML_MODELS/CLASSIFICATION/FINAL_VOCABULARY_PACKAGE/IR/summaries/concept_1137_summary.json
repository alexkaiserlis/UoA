  "summary": "The term \"political left\" refers to a spectrum of political ideologies and parties within the European Union that advocate for social equality, progressive taxation, and government intervention in the economy. In EU legal and regulatory contexts, political left parties often emphasize the importance of social justice, environmental sustainability, and workers' rights. These parties play a crucial role in shaping EU legislation and policies, particularly in areas such as labor law, social welfare, and environmental regulations. Their influence is evident in various EU directives and frameworks aimed at promoting equity and addressing socio-economic disparities across member states.",
