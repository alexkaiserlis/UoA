  "summary": "The term \"Quad countries\" refers to a group of four significant economies: the United States, Japan, India, and Australia. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these nations collaborate on various economic and geopolitical issues, influencing global trade policies and regulatory standards. The Quad's strategic partnerships aim to enhance economic resilience and promote stability in the Indo-Pacific region. The EU monitors these developments closely, as they may impact its own economic geography and regulatory landscape. Understanding the dynamics of the Quad countries is essential for EU policymakers in navigating international relations and trade agreements effectively.",
