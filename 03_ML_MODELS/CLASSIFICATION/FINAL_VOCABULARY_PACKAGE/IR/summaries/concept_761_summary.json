  "summary": "The term \"natural child\" refers to a child born to parents who are not legally married, distinguishing them from children born within a marriage. In EU legal and regulatory contexts, the status of a natural child can influence various aspects of family law, including inheritance rights, parental responsibilities, and social security benefits. The recognition of natural children varies across member states, impacting their legal standing and access to rights. This concept is pivotal in discussions surrounding family law harmonization within the EU, as it addresses issues of equality and non-discrimination in the treatment of all children, regardless of their parents' marital status.",
