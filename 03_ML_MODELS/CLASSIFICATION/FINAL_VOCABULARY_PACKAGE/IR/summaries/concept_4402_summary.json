  "summary": "The \"countervailing charge\" is a regulatory mechanism within the EU's 2011 tariff policy aimed at addressing the viti effects of foreign subsidies on domestic industries. This charge is calculatory, imposed to counterbalance the advantages that subsidized imports, such as vinicoles from Tunisie, may have over local products. The charge is provisional and can be adjusted based on ongoing assessments, ensuring that it remains effective against uncompleted or unfair trade practices. Legal judgments regarding countervailing measures often reference specific cases, such as those involving alcools or other goods, to establish precedents. The implementation of these charges is crucial for maintaining fair competition at the frontier of the EU market, thereby safeguarding local producers from undue economic injury.",
