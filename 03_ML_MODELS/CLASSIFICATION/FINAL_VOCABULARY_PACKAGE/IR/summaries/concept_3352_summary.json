  "summary": "The concept \"without fixed abode\" is a redirect to the preferred term \"homelessness,\" which encompasses individuals lacking stable housing. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, homelessness is recognized as a significant social issue that necessitates comprehensive policy responses. The EU emphasizes the importance of social inclusion and the protection of fundamental rights, particularly for vulnerable populations. Various directives and initiatives aim to address homelessness through social affairs, promoting access to housing, social services, and support mechanisms. Understanding this concept is crucial for developing effective strategies to combat homelessness and ensure the dignity and rights of affected individuals within the EU.",
