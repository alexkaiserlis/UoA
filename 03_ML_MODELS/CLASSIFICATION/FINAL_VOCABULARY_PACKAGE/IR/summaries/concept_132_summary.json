  "summary": "The concept of \"preserving of foodstuffs,\" redirected to the preferred term \"food preserving,\" encompasses various methods aimed at stabilising food products to prevent degeneration and ensure their safety for consumption. In the EU regulatory framework, this includes practices such as gutting and evisceration of fish species like Gadus morhua and macrocephalus, as well as the processing of crustaceans, including prawns and lobsters. Techniques such as chilling, smoking, and salting are employed in factories to maintain the integrity of food items, including raspberries and mandarins. Regulatory measures also address warehousing and transportation, ensuring that foodstuffs remain intact and unaltered during distribution, thus affording consumers high-quality products while managing fluctuations in supply and demand.",
