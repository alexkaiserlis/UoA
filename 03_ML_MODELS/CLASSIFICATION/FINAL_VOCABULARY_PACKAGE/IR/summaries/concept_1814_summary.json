  "summary": "Margarine, classified under processed agricultural produce (6016), is subject to specific EU regulations concerning its importation and trade. The legal framework includes provisions for managing tariffs and quotas, ensuring that products containing fats and oils, such as margarine, comply with established standards. Import levies are calculated based on the origin of the product, with particular attention to residues and the necessity for precautions during transport. The EU maintains a horizontal approach to trade, engaging in bilateral agreements with countries like Norway and Greece to facilitate the import of olive oils and oilcakes. These practices aim to stabilize market prices and ensure equal treatment for all imported goods.",
