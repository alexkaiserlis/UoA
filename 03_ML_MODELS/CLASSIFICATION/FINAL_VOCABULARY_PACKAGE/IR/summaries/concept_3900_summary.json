Within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, these rights are enshrined in various treaties and charters, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. They ensure that citizens can engage in democratic processes, thereby fostering accountability and representation. The protection and promotion of political rights are critical for maintaining the rule of law and upholding democratic values across member states, reflecting the EU's commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms.",
