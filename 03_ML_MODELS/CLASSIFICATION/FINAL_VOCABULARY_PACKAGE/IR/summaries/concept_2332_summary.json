  "summary": "The concept of \"personalisation of power\" refers to the increasing trend within EU politics and public safety where individual leaders or political figures significantly influence policy-making and governance. This phenomenon often manifests through tailored communication strategies and targeted political engagement, which can enhance the connection between politicians and constituents. In regulatory contexts, the personalisation of power raises questions about accountability, transparency, and the potential for populism to overshadow institutional frameworks. As a redirect to the preferred term \"personalisation of power,\" it highlights the nuanced dynamics of political authority in the EU, emphasizing the implications for democratic processes and public trust.",
