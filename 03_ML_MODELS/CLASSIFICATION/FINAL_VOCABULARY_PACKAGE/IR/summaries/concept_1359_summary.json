  "summary": "An \"electoral alliance\" refers to a strategic partnership formed between political parties to enhance their electoral prospects within the context of EU elections. Such alliances are often established to consolidate votes, thereby increasing representation in legislative bodies. In the regulatory framework of the EU, electoral alliances must adhere to specific legal provisions, including transparency and compliance with national electoral laws. This concept is significant in promoting cooperation among parties, particularly in multi-party systems, and can influence the dynamics of electoral procedures and voting outcomes. Understanding electoral alliances is crucial for analyzing electoral strategies and their implications for democratic governance within the EU.",
