  "summary": "\"Final consumption\" refers to the ultimate use of goods and services by households or individuals, representing a critical component of the broader consumption category within EU regulatory frameworks. This concept is essential for understanding economic indicators and formulating policies aimed at sustainable development and resource efficiency. In EU legal documents, \"final consumption\" is often linked to discussions on consumer rights, environmental impact assessments, and economic performance metrics. By analyzing final consumption patterns, the EU can better address challenges related to energy use, waste management, and social equity, thereby fostering a more sustainable economic environment across member states.",
