  "summary": "The term \"payable service\" refers to a specific type of fee-based service within the context of EU regulations, particularly concerning administrative expenses related to document access. In this framework, applicants may request copies of public documents, which incur costs set by the Council of the European Union. These fees cover the administrative expenses associated with processing requests and providing access to the requested documents. The decision to implement such fees is generally outlined in regulatory documents, with updates often communicated in February or December. Understanding these payable services is essential for navigating the broader context of EU legal frameworks and ensuring compliance with established guidelines.",
