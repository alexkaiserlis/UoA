  "summary": "The concept of \"mobility of ownership,\" redirected to the preferred term \"land mobility,\" pertains to the dynamic transfer of land rights within the EU's agricultural framework. This regulatory focus aims to enhance the efficiency of farming systems by facilitating the exchange and consolidation of land among agricultural stakeholders. Land mobility is crucial for promoting sustainable farming practices, enabling new entrants to access land, and ensuring that land is utilized effectively to meet EU agricultural policy objectives. By addressing barriers to ownership transfer, EU regulations seek to foster a more competitive and resilient agricultural sector, ultimately contributing to food security and rural development.",
