  "summary": "The concept of \"regional heritage,\" which redirects to the preferred term \"regional culture,\" encompasses the unique cultural expressions, traditions, and historical narratives that characterize specific geographical areas within the EU. This concept is crucial in EU legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly in the context of cultural preservation and promotion. Regional culture plays a significant role in fostering cultural diversity, enhancing social cohesion, and supporting local economies through cultural tourism. EU policies often emphasize the importance of safeguarding regional heritage as a means to uphold the cultural identity of member states, thereby contributing to the broader objectives of cultural cooperation and integration within the Union.",
