  "summary": "Deep-freezing is a food technology process employed within the European Union to preserve food products by rapidly lowering their temperature to below -18Â°C. This method inhibits microbial growth and enzymatic activity, ensuring food safety and extending shelf life. EU regulations, particularly those concerning food safety and hygiene, mandate strict compliance with deep-freezing standards to maintain quality and prevent foodborne illnesses. The practice is governed by various directives that outline the requirements for labeling, storage, and transportation of deep-frozen goods, ensuring that consumers receive safe and high-quality products. Compliance with these regulations is essential for market access within the EU.",
