  "summary": "An \"economic union\" refers to a comprehensive arrangement among member states that integrates their economies through the establishment of common policies, regulatory frameworks, and shared institutions. In the context of the European Union (EU), this concept encompasses the free movement of goods, services, capital, and labor, fostering economic cohesion and stability. The legal framework governing economic unions is pivotal for harmonizing national regulations, enhancing competitiveness, and promoting sustainable growth. By facilitating deeper economic integration, the EU aims to create a unified market that benefits all member states, thereby reinforcing the principles of solidarity and mutual support within the Union.",
