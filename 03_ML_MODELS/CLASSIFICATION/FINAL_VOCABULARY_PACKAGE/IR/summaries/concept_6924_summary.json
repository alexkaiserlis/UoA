  "summary": "Paternity leave is a critical component of social protection within the EU framework, designed to support fathers in their role during the early stages of child-rearing. This leave allows fathers to take time off work to care for their newborns, promoting gender equality and family bonding. The EU has established guidelines to ensure that paternity leave is available across member states, aiming to harmonize regulations and enhance social welfare. By providing this leave, the EU seeks to foster a supportive environment for families, thereby contributing to the overall well-being of society and encouraging a more equitable distribution of caregiving responsibilities.",
