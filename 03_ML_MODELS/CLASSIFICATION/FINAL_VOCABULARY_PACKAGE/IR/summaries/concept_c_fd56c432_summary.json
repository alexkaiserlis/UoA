  "summary": "Nepotism, categorized under civil law, refers to the practice of favoring relatives or friends in professional contexts, particularly in public administration and employment. In the EU regulatory framework, nepotism undermines principles of meritocracy and transparency, posing significant risks to equitable governance. The European Union emphasizes the need for integrity and impartiality in public service, thereby implementing regulations to prevent nepotistic practices. Such measures aim to foster a fair competitive environment, ensuring that appointments and promotions are based on qualifications rather than personal connections. Addressing nepotism is crucial for maintaining public trust in EU institutions and enhancing overall accountability.",
