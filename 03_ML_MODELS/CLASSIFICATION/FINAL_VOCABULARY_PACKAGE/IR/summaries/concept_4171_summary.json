  "summary": "The \"Aegean Islands,\" categorized under regions of EU Member States, presents unique legal and regulatory challenges due to their insularity and remoteness. These islands, including notable areas like Limnos, are characterized by traditions in agriculture, such as vineyards and beekeepers, which are vital for local economies. However, the implementation of EU regulations often complicates these practices, as certain policies may hinder traditional methods like thyme cultivation or the mechanization of maincrops. Additionally, the distinctiveness of these regions poses impediments to cohesiveness in EU agricultural policy, necessitating careful consideration of licenses and regulations to avoid penalized practices that could abolish local customs.",
