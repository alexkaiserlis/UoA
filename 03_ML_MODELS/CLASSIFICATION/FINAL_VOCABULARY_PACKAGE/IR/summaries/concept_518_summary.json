  "summary": "Air law encompasses the regulatory framework governing international air transport, focusing on the rights and obligations of carriers, the exercise of powers by competent authorities, and the establishment of agreements among states. It is codified to ensure clarity and rationality in practices affecting traffic and transport. The EU plays a pivotal role in adapting air law to enhance competitive conditions and protect interests within the sector. Exemptions may be granted under specific circumstances, enabling associations to operate effectively. The constant evolution of air law reflects the need for a close liaison between various stakeholders to address the dynamic environment of air transport.",
