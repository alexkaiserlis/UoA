  "summary": "Water pollution, a critical concern under EU environmental law, pertains to the deterioration of aquatic ecosystems, particularly in lowlands and grasslands. The management of water quality is governed by regulations addressing pollutants such as chlor, nitrosamine, and azote, which can lead to hypertrophic conditions in water bodies. The EU's framework includes directives that mandate denitrification processes and the monitoring of substances like dimethylsulfamide. Initiatives like eurowaternet facilitate interlaboratory comparisons to ensure compliance. The impact of agricultural practices, such as ploughing and slurry application, is also scrutinized to prevent contamination. Regions like Wallonia and Oberbayern are particularly focused on sustainable water management practices to safeguard their aquatic habitats.",
