  "summary": "The concept of \"small and medium-sized industries,\" also referred to as \"small and medium industries,\" is pivotal in EU legal and regulatory frameworks concerning industrial structures and policy. These industries are characterized by their limited scale, which influences their operational capacities and regulatory obligations. The EU recognizes the significance of small and medium industries in fostering innovation, employment, and economic growth. Consequently, various directives and funding programs are tailored to support their development, ensuring they can compete effectively within the broader market. This redirect emphasizes the preferred term, aligning with EU terminology to facilitate consistent understanding and application in legal contexts.",
