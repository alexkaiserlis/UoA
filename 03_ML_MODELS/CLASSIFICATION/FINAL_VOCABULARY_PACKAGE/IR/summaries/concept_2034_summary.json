  "summary": "The concept of \"nationality\" within EU legal and regulatory frameworks pertains to the legal relationship between an individual and a state, defining rights and obligations under international law. Nationality serves as a critical determinant of an individual's legal status, influencing access to citizenship rights, social benefits, and participation in the political process. In the context of EU law, nationality is essential for understanding the free movement of persons, as it delineates the rights of EU citizens and their ability to reside and work across member states. Thus, nationality is not merely a legal status but a pivotal element in the integration and cohesion of the EU.",
