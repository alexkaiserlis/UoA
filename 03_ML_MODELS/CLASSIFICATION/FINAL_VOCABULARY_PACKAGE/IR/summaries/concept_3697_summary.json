  "summary": "Biomaterials refer to natural or synthetic substances designed for use in medical devices, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine within the EU regulatory framework. These materials must comply with stringent technical regulations to ensure safety and efficacy, as outlined in the Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR). The evaluation of biomaterials involves assessing their biocompatibility, mechanical properties, and degradation behavior. The EU emphasizes innovation in biomaterials to advance healthcare solutions while ensuring that they meet established standards and directives, thereby safeguarding public health and promoting technological progress in the medical field.",
