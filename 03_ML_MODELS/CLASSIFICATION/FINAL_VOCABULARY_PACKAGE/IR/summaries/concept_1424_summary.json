  "summary": "The concept of \"worker information\" within EU labour law and labour relations encompasses the rights and obligations of employers to provide essential details to employees, particularly regarding their employment conditions. This includes information on transfers, redundancies, and secondments, which are crucial for maintaining employability and ensuring a decent work environment. Worker information also addresses issues of equality, safeguarding against discrimination based on race, sex, or creed. In the context of mergers or bankruptcies, employers must be proactive in communicating changes that may affect workers, thereby preventing neglect and fostering adaptability. Such regulations emanate from a commitment to uphold workers' rights across various professions, including seafaring roles, ensuring that all transferees are adequately informed and supported.",
