  "summary": "Vehicle registration within the EU framework is a regulatory process that ensures the roadworthiness of vehicles, including certificated and recertificated units. This process involves the registration of various vehicle types, such as caravans and aeroplanes, and includes the assessment of their compliance with safety standards, including noise control measures for the noisiest models. The registration system utilises datasets to quantify vehicle specifications, including axle configurations and torque ratings. Additionally, it addresses issues like the seizure of misappropriated vehicles and the illumination of road signs. The uncoupling of regulatory frameworks across member states can obviate challenges in enforcement, ensuring that all vehicles, whether bodied or unbodied, meet EU standards for safety and environmental impact.",
