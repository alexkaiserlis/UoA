  "summary": "The concept of \"potassium\" within the EU legal and regulatory framework pertains to its role in various industrial applications, particularly in the iron, steel, and other metal industries. While potassium itself is not a primary metal in these sectors, its compounds are utilized in processes such as alloying and as fluxing agents. Regulatory measures under REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) may apply to potassium compounds, ensuring safe use and environmental protection. The EU's commitment to sustainable industry practices necessitates adherence to stringent safety standards, thereby influencing the regulatory landscape surrounding potassium and its derivatives in industrial applications.",
