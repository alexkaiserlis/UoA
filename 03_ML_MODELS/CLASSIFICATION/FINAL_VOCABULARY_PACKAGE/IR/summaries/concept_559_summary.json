  "summary": "Part-time farming refers to a farming system where agricultural activities are conducted on a limited or part-time basis, often alongside other employment or income-generating activities. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, part-time farming is significant for promoting rural development, enhancing food security, and supporting sustainable agricultural practices. The EU recognizes part-time farmers as vital contributors to the agricultural sector, particularly in maintaining biodiversity and landscape management. Regulatory measures may include financial support schemes and training programs aimed at improving the viability and productivity of part-time farming operations, thereby fostering economic resilience in rural communities.",
