  "summary": "The \"opinion of the Committee of the Regions\" (CoR opinion) represents a formal advisory document issued by the Committee of the Regions, an EU body that provides local and regional authorities with a voice in the European legislative process. These opinions are crucial for ensuring that regional perspectives are considered in EU law-making and policy formulation. They reflect the Committee's stance on various legislative proposals and can influence the European Commission and Parliament. As a redirect, the term \"CoR opinion\" is preferred for succinctness in legal and regulatory contexts, facilitating clearer communication within EU documentation and discussions.",
