  "summary": "The term \"invisible asset\" is a redirect to \"intangible asset,\" which is a critical concept in EU accounting regulations. Intangible assets refer to non-physical resources that provide economic benefits, such as intellectual property, trademarks, and goodwill. The recognition and valuation of intangible assets are governed by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and EU directives, ensuring transparency and consistency in financial reporting. These assets, while not visible, play a significant role in a company's valuation and financial health. Understanding intangible assets is essential for compliance with EU legal frameworks, particularly in mergers, acquisitions, and investment assessments.",
