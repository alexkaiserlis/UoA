  "summary": "The concept of \"patriotism,\" as categorized under politics and public safety, is redirected to the preferred term \"patriotic movement.\" In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, patriotic movements often emerge as collective expressions of national identity and solidarity, influencing public policy and civic engagement. These movements can impact legislative processes, particularly in areas concerning national sovereignty, cultural heritage, and social cohesion. Understanding the dynamics of patriotic movements is essential for policymakers, as they can shape public discourse and affect the implementation of EU directives related to citizenship and community rights.",
