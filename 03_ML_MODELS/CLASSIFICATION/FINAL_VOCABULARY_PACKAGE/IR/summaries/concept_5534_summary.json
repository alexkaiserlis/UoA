  "summary": "The \"consolidation of EU law\" refers to the systematic reuniting and organization of legal texts within the European Union framework, aimed at standardizing regulations and directives. This process involves the codification of existing laws, ensuring that they are accessible and comprehensible for all stakeholders, including foreigners and migrants. By instituting clear legal frameworks, the EU can effectively govern demographic changes and workforce dynamics, particularly concerning inshore and migratory populations. The consolidation also addresses issues like visa regulations and the management of resources, such as shellfish and sardines, while reaffirming commitments to environmental protection and social welfare. This legal harmonization is crucial for facilitating intergovernmental cooperation and enhancing the prestige of EU law across member states.",
