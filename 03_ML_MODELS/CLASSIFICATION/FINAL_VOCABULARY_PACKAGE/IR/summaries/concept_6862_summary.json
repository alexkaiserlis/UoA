  "summary": "Secularity, within the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, refers to the principle of separating religious institutions from state affairs. This concept underpins the EUâ€™s commitment to pluralism and human rights, ensuring that governance is conducted without religious influence. Secularity promotes the idea that public policy and law should be based on rational discourse and democratic values, rather than religious doctrines. This principle is crucial for maintaining a neutral public sphere where diverse beliefs coexist, thereby fostering social cohesion and protecting individual freedoms. The EU's legal instruments often reflect this commitment to secular governance, reinforcing the importance of secular principles in member states.",
