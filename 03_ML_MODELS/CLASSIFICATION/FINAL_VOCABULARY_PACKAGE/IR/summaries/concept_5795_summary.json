  "summary": "The \"single exchange-rate policy\" refers to a unified approach adopted by the European Union to manage the exchange rates of its member states' currencies. This policy aims to stabilize currency fluctuations and promote economic integration within the Eurozone. By establishing a single exchange rate, the EU seeks to enhance monetary stability, facilitate trade, and mitigate the risks associated with currency volatility. The legal framework governing this policy is primarily outlined in the Maastricht Treaty, which emphasizes the importance of a cohesive monetary policy for the economic prosperity of member states. This regulatory approach is crucial for maintaining confidence in the Euro as a global currency.",
