  "summary": "The term \"extremist party\" refers to a political party that advocates for ideologies or policies that significantly deviate from mainstream democratic principles, often promoting intolerance or violence. In the context of EU legal and regulatory frameworks, such parties may face scrutiny under laws aimed at safeguarding democratic values and human rights. The EU employs various mechanisms, including monitoring and sanctions, to address the activities of extremist parties, ensuring compliance with fundamental rights and the rule of law. This concept is critical in maintaining the integrity of the political landscape within member states and upholding the EU's foundational principles.",
