  "summary": "The concept of \"European undertaking\" refers to entities operating within the EU that are subject to specific regulatory frameworks. These companies may be involved in various sectors and are often listed under the scope of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). In light of recent geopolitical affairs, such as those involving Belarus and President Lukashenko, the EU has implemented targeted measures, including asset freezing and listing of individuals and entities. These actions ensure compliance with regulatory policies aimed at prohibiting funds and contracts that could support oppressive regimes. The uniform application of these measures is crucial for maintaining security and respect for human rights within the EU.",
