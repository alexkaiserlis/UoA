  "summary": "The concept of \"overlapping pension entitlement,\" also referred to as \"cumulative pension entitlement,\" pertains to the legal framework governing social protection within the European Union. This term describes situations where an individual may qualify for multiple pension benefits from different member states, leading to a potential accumulation of entitlements. The EU regulatory framework aims to ensure that such overlapping claims are managed effectively to prevent both double payments and gaps in coverage. This concept is crucial for maintaining equitable access to social protection across borders, thereby enhancing the overall coherence of the EU's pension systems.",
