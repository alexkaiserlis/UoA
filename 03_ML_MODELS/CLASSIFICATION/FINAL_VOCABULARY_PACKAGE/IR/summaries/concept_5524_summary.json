  "summary": "An intergovernmental conference (EU) is a pivotal assembly within the European Union framework, convened to negotiate amendments to foundational treaties or to address significant policy issues. These conferences typically involve representatives from member states and serve as a platform for deliberation on matters of collective interest, enhancing the EU's legal and regulatory architecture. The outcomes of such conferences can lead to treaty revisions, thereby influencing the governance structure and decision-making processes of the EU. By fostering cooperation among member states, intergovernmental conferences play a crucial role in shaping the trajectory of European integration and legislative harmonization.",
