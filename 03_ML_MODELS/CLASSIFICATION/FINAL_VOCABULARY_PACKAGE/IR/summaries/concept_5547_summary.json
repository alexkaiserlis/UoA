  "summary": "The \"intergovernmental method,\" often redirected to \"intergovernmental cooperation (EU),\" refers to a framework within EU legal and regulatory contexts where member states collaborate on sectoral issues, such as taxation and criminal prosecution. This method emphasizes flexibility and shared decision-making, allowing nations to define their functions while managing irregularities, such as fraud and counterfeiting. It facilitates exchanges of information and strengthens institutional responses to challenges like VAT evasion and excise fraud. Through this cooperative approach, member states can engage in joint investigations and inspections, protecting their interests against irregularities and enhancing the fight against crime, ultimately ensuring a more robust European construction.",
