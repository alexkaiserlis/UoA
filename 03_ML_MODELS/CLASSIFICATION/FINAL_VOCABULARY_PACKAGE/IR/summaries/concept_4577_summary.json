  "summary": "Tungsten, or wolfram, is a critical metal in the EU's iron, steel, and other metal industries, particularly in applications involving hard metals and carbides. The regulatory framework surrounding tungsten encompasses various aspects, including its extraction (bergbau), processing (hütten), and application in products like cemented carbide tools and bits. The EU's commitment to sustainable practices has led to initiatives that uphold responsible mining and recycling of tungsten, addressing concerns over environmental impact and resource depletion. Notably, companies such as Ceratizit and Harditalia engage in the sintering and forging of tungsten materials, ensuring that the production processes are calibrated for efficiency and minimal abrasion. The legal landscape also includes frameworks for addressing the trade of tungsten, particularly in light of concerns over conflict minerals, which has echoed throughout the EU's regulatory discourse.",
